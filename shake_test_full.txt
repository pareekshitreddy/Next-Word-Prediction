dius which timon redeem d from prison
then comes dropping after all apemantus discontentedly like himself ventidius
most honoured timon it hath pleas d the gods to remember my father s age and call him to long peace
he is gone happy and has left me rich
then as in grateful virtue i am bound to your free heart i do return those talents doubled with thanks and service from whose help i deriv d liberty
o by no means honest ventidius
you mistake my love i gave it freely ever and there s none can truly say he gives if he receives
if our betters play at that game we must not dare to imitate them faults that are rich are fair
nay my lords ceremony was but devis d at first to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes recanting goodness sorry ere tis shown but where there is true friendship there needs none
pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes than my fortunes to me
my lord we always have confess d it
hang d it have you not
no you shall not make me welcome
i come to have thee thrust me out of doors
fie th art a churl ye have got a humour there does not become a man tis much to blame
they say my lords ira furor brevis est but yond man is ever angry
go let him have a table by himself for he does neither affect company nor is he fit for t indeed
let me stay at thine apperil timon
i come to observe i give thee warning on t
i take no heed of thee
th art an athenian therefore welcome
i myself would have no power prithee let my meat make thee silent
i scorn thy meat t would choke me for i should ne er flatter thee
o you gods what a number of men eats timon and he sees em not
it grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man s blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too
i wonder men dare trust themselves with men
methinks they should invite them without knives good for their meat and safer for their lives
there s much example for t the fellow that sits next him now parts bread with him pledges the breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest man to kill him
if i were a huge man i should fear to drink at meals
lest they should spy my windpipe s dangerous notes great men should drink with harness on their throats
and let the health go round
let it flow this way my good lord
those healths will make thee and thy state look ill timon
here s that which is too weak to be a sinner honest water which ne er left man i th mire
this and my food are equals there s no odds
feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods
apemantus grace immortal gods i crave no pelf i pray for no man but myself
grant i may never prove so fond to trust man on his oath or bond or a harlot for her weeping or a dog that seems a sleeping or a keeper with my freedom or my friends if i should need em
rich men sin and i eat root
eats and drinks much good dich thy good heart apemantus
captain alcibiades your heart s in the field now
my heart is ever at your service my lord
you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of friends
so they were bleeding new my lord there s no meat like em i could wish my best friend at such a feast
would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that then thou mightst kill em and bid me to em
might we but have that happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect
o no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that i shall have much help from you
how had you been my friends else
why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart
i have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf and thus far i confirm you
o you gods think i what need we have any friends if we should ne er have need of em
they were the most needless creatures living should we ne er have use for em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves
why i have often wish d myself poorer that i might come nearer to you
we are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends
o what a precious comfort tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another s fortunes
o joy s e en made away ere t can be born
mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks
to forget their faults i drink to you
thou weep st to make them drink timon
joy had the like conception in our eyes and at that instant like a babe sprung up
i laugh to think that babe a bastard
i promise you my lord you mov d me much
please you my lord there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance
there comes with them a forerunner my lord which bears that office to signify their pleasures
i pray let them be admitted
hail to thee worthy timon and to all that of his bounties taste
the five best senses acknowledge thee their patron and come freely to gratulate thy plenteous bosom
th ear taste touch smell pleas d from thy table rise they only now come but to feast thine eyes
they re welcome all let em have kind admittance
you see my lord how ample y are belov d
re enter cupid witb a masque of ladies as amazons with lutes in their hands dancing and playing apemantus
hoy day what a sweep of vanity comes this way
like madness is the glory of this life as this pomp shows to a little oil and root
we make ourselves fools to disport ourselves and spend our flatteries to drink those men upon whose age we void it up again with poisonous spite and envy
who lives that s not depraved or depraves
who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves of their friends gift
i should fear those that dance before me now would one day stamp upon me
t has been done men shut their doors against a setting sun
the lords rise from table with much adoring of timon and to show their loves each single out an amazon and all dance men witb women a lofty strain or two to the hautboys and cease timon
you have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies set a fair fashion on our entertainment which was not half so beautiful and kind you have added worth unto t and lustre and entertain d me with mine own device i am to thank you for t
my lord you take us even at the best
faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking i doubt me
ladies there is an idle banquet attends you please you to dispose yourselves
the little casket bring me hither
there is no crossing him in s humour else i should tell him well i faith i should when all s spent he d be cross d then an he could
tis pity bounty had not eyes behind that man might ne er be wretched for his mind
re enter flavius with the casket timon
o my friends i have one word to say to you
look you my good lord i must entreat you honour me so much as to advance this jewel accept it and wear it kind my lord
i am so far already in your gifts all
my lord there are certain nobles of the senate newly alighted and come to visit you
i beseech your honour vouchsafe me a word it does concern you near
why then another time i ll hear thee
i prithee let s be provided to show them entertainment
may it please vour honour lord lucius out of his free love hath presented to you four milk white horses trapp d in silver
let the presents be worthily entertain d
exit servant enter a third servant how now
please you my lord that honourable gentleman lord lucullus entreats your company to morrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds
i ll hunt with him and let them be receiv d not without fair reward
aside what will this come to
he commands us to provide and give great gifts and all out of an empty coffer nor will he know his purse or yield me this to show him what a beggar his heart is being of no power to make his wishes good
his promises fly so beyond his state that what he speaks is all in debt he owes for ev ry word
he is so kind that he now pays interest for t his land s put to their books
well would i were gently put out of office before i were forc d out
happier is he that has no friend to feed than such that do e en enemies exceed
i bleed inwardly for my lord
you do yourselves much wrong you bate too much of your own merits
here my lord a trifle of our love
with more than common thanks i will receive it
o he s the very soul of bounty
and now i remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser i rode on
tis yours because you lik d it
o i beseech you pardon me my lord in that
you may take my word my lord i know no man can justly praise but what he does affect
i weigh my friend s affection with mine own
i ll tell you true i ll call to you
i take all and your several visitations so kind to heart tis not enough to give methinks i could deal kingdoms to my friends and ne er be weary
alcibiades thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
it comes in charity to thee for all thy living is mongst the dead and all the lands thou hast lie in a pitch d field
ay defil d land my lord
we are so virtuously bound timon
and so am i to you
the best of happiness honour and fortunes keep with you lord timon
exeunt all but apemantus and timon apemantus
serving of becks and jutting out of bums
i doubt whether their legs be worth the sums that are given for em
friendship s full of dregs methinks false hearts should never have sound legs
thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies
now apemantus if thou wert not sullen i would be good to thee
no i ll nothing for if i should be brib d too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster
thou giv st so long timon i fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly
what needs these feasts pomps and vain glories
nay an you begin to rail on society once i am sworn not to give regard to you
farewell and come with better music
thou wilt not hear me now thou shalt not then
i ll lock thy heaven from thee
o that men s ears should be to counsel deaf but not to flattery
a senator s house enter a senator with papers in his hand senator
to varro and to isidore he owes nine thousand besides my former sum which makes it five and twenty
still in motion of raging waste
it cannot hold it will not
if i want gold steal but a beggar s dog and give it timon why the dog coins gold
if i would sell my horse and buy twenty moe better than he why give my horse to timon ask nothing give it him it foals me straight and able horses
no porter at his gate but rather one that smiles and still invites all that pass by
it cannot hold no reason can sound his state in safety
here sir what is your pleasure
get on your cloak and haste you to lord timon importune him for my moneys be not ceas d with slight denial nor then silenc d when commend me to your master and the cap plays in the right hand thus but tell him my uses cry to me i must serve my turn out of mine own his days and times are past and my reliances on his fracted dates have smit my credit
i love and honour him but must not break my back to heal his finger
immediate are my needs and my relief must not be toss d and turn d to me in words but find supply immediate
get you gone put on a most importunate aspect a visage of demand for i do fear when every feather sticks in his own wing lord timon will be left a naked gull which flashes now a phoenix
take the bonds along with you and have the dates in compt
before timon s house enter flavius timon s steward with many bills in his hand flavius
so senseless of expense that he will neither know how to maintain it nor cease his flow of riot takes no account how things go from him nor resumes no care of what is to continue
never mind was to be so unwise to be so kind
he will not hear till feel
i must be round with him
enter caphis and the servants of isidore and varro caphis
is t not your business too
would we were all discharg d
enter timon and his train with alcibiades timon
so soon as dinner s done we ll forth again my alcibiades with me
my lord here is a note of certain dues
please it your lordship he hath put me off to the succession of new days this month
my master is awak d by great occasion to call upon his own and humbly prays you that with your other noble parts you ll suit in giving him his right
mine honest friend i prithee but repair to me next morning
one varro s servant my good lord isidore s servant
from isidore he humbly prays your speedy payment caphis
if you did know my lord my master s wants varro s servant
twas due on forfeiture my lord six weeks and past
your steward puts me off my lord and i am sent expressly to your lordship
i do beseech you good my lords keep on i ll wait upon you instantly
exeunt alcibiades and lords to flavius come hither
pray you how goes the world that i am thus encount red with clamorous demands of date broke bonds and the detention of long since due debts against my honour
please you gentlemen the time is unagreeable to this business
your importunacy cease till after dinner that i may make his lordship understand wherefore you are not paid
exit enter apemantus and fool caphis
stay stay here comes the fool with apemantus
let s ha some sport with em
hang him he ll abuse us
to varro s servant there s the fool hangs on your back already
no thou stand st single th art not on him yet
he last ask d the question
that you ask me what you are and do not know yourselves
she s e en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are
would we could see you at corinth
look you here comes my mistress page
to the fool why how now captain
what do you in this wise company
would i had a rod in my mouth that i might answer thee profitably
prithee apemantus read me the superscription of these letters i know not which is which
there will little learning die then that day thou art hang d
this is to lord timon this to alcibiades
go thou wast born a bastard and thou t die a bawd
thou wast whelp d a dog and thou shalt famish dog s death
e en so thou outrun st grace
fool i will go with you to lord timon s
ay would they serv d us
so would i as good a trick as ever hangman serv d thief
i think no usurer but has a fool to his servant
my mistress is one and i am her fool
when men come to borrow of your masters they approach sadly and go away merry but they enter my mistress house merrily and go away sadly
do it then that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave which notwithstanding thou shalt be no less esteemed
a fool in good clothes and something like thee
sometime t appears like a lord sometime like a lawyer sometime like a philosopher with two stones moe than s artificial one
he is very often like a knight and generally in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen this spirit walks in
thou art not altogether a fool
nor thou altogether a wise man
as much foolery as i have so much wit thou lack st
that answer might have become apemantus
aside aside here comes lord timon
re enter timon and flavius apemantus
i do not always follow lover elder brother and woman sometime the philosopher
pray you walk near i ll speak with you anon
you make me marvel wherefore ere this time had you not fully laid my state before me that i might so have rated my expense as i had leave of means
you would not hear me at many leisures i propos d
go to perchance some single vantages you took when my indisposition put you back and that unaptness made your minister thus to excuse yourself
o my good lord at many times i brought in my accounts laid them before you you would throw them off and say you found them in mine honesty
when for some trifling present you have bid me return so much i have shook my head and wept yea gainst th authority of manners pray d you to hold your hand more close
i did endure not seldom nor no slight checks when i have prompted you in the ebb of your estate and your great flow of debts
my lov d lord though you hear now too late yet now s a time the greatest of your having lacks a half to pay your present debts
let all my land be sold
tis all engag d some forfeited and gone and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues
the future comes apace what shall defend the interim
and at length how goes our reck ning
to lacedaemon did my land extend
o my good lord the world is but a word were it all yours to give it in a breath how quickly were it gone
if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood call me before th exactest auditors and set me on the proof
so the gods bless me when all our offices have been oppress d with riotous feeders when our vaults have wept with drunken spilth of wine when every room hath blaz d with lights and bray d with minstrelsy i have retir d me to a wasteful cock and set mine eyes at flow
heavens have i said the bounty of this lord
how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants this night englutted
who is not lord timon s
what heart head sword force means but is lord timon s
great timon noble worthy royal timon
when the means are gone that buy this praise the breath is gone whereof this praise is made
feast won fast lost one cloud of winter show rs these flies are couch d
no villainous bounty yet hath pass d my heart unwisely not ignobly have i given
canst thou the conscience lack to think i shall lack friends
secure thy heart if i would broach the vessels of my love and try the argument of hearts by borrowing men and men s fortunes could i frankly use as i can bid thee speak
and in some sort these wants of mine are crown d that i account them blessings for by these shall i try friends
you shall perceive how you mistake my fortunes i am wealthy in my friends
enter flaminius servilius and another servant servants
i will dispatch you severally you to lord lucius to lord lucullus you i hunted with his honour to day
commend me to their loves and i am proud say that my occasions have found time to use em toward a supply of money
let the request be fifty talents
as you have said my lord
go you sir to the senators of whom even to the state s best health i have deserv d this hearing
bid em send o th instant a thousand talents to me
i have been bold for that i knew it the most general way to them to use your signet and your name but they do shake their heads and i am here no richer in return
they answer in a joint and corporate voice that now they are at fall want treasure cannot do what they would are sorry you are honourable but yet they could have wish d they know not something hath been amiss a noble nature may catch a wrench would all were well tis pity and so intending other serious matters after distasteful looks and these hard fractions with certain half caps and cold moving nods they froze me into silence
these old fellows have their ingratitude in them hereditary
their blood is cak d tis cold it seldom flows tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind and nature as it grows again toward earth is fashion d for the journey dull and heavy
prithee be not sad thou art true and honest ingeniously i speak no blame belongs to thee
ventidius lately buried his father by whose death he s stepp d into a great estate
when he was poor imprison d and in scarcity of friends i clear d him with five talents
greet him from me bid him suppose some good necessity touches his friend which craves to be rememb red with those five talents
that had give t these fellows to whom tis instant due
nev r speak or think that timon s fortunes mong his friends can sink
i would i could not think it
that thought is bounty s foe being free itself it thinks all others so
scene i lucullus house flaminius waiting to speak with lucullus
i have told my lord of you he is coming down to you
aside one of lord timon s men
why this hits right i dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to night flaminius honest flaminius you are very respectively welcome sir
exit servant and how does that honourable complete freehearted gentleman of athens thy very bountiful good lord and master
i am right glad that his health is well sir
and what hast thou there under thy cloak pretty flaminius
faith nothing but an empty box sir which in my lord s behalf i come to entreat your honour to supply who having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein
a noble gentleman tis if he would not keep so good a house
many a time and often i ha din d with him and told him on t and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming
every man has his fault and honesty is his
i ha told him on t but i could ne er get him from t
re enter servant with wine servant
please your lordship here is the wine
flaminius i have noted thee always wise
i have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and canst use the time well if the time use thee well
to servant get you gone sirrah
exit servant draw nearer honest flaminius
thy lord s a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise and thou know st well enough although thou com st to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare friendship without security
here s three solidares for thee
good boy wink at me and say thou saw st me not
is t possible the world should so much differ and we alive that liv d
fly damned baseness to him that worships thee
now i see thou art a fool and fit for thy master
may these add to the number that may scald thee
let molten coin be thy damnation thou disease of a friend and not himself
has friendship such a faint and milky heart it turns in less than two nights
o you gods i feel my master s passion
this slave unto his honour has my lord s meat in him why should it thrive and turn to nutriment when he is turn d to poison
o may diseases only work upon t
and when he s sick to death let not that part of nature which my lord paid for be of any power to expel sickness but prolong his hour
a public place enter lucius with three strangers lucius
he is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman
we know him for no less though we are but strangers to him
but i can tell you one thing my lord and which i hear from common rumours now lord timon s happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him
fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money
but believe you this my lord that not long ago one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many talents nay urg d extremely for t and showed what necessity belong d to t and yet was denied
i tell you denied my lord
what a strange case was that
now before the gods i am asham d on t
there was very little honour show d in t
for my own part i must needs confess i have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me i should ne er have denied his occasion so many talents
see by good hap yonder s my lord i have sweat to see his honour my honour d lord
fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend
may it please your honour my lord hath sent lucius
i am so much endeared to that lord he s ever sending
how shall i thank him think st thou
and what has he sent now
has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents
i know his lordship is but merry with me he cannot want fifty five hundred talents
but in the mean time he wants less my lord
if his occasion were not virtuous i should not urge it half so faithfully
upon my soul tis true sir
what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such a good time when i might ha shown myself honourable
how unluckily it happ ned that i should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour
servilius now before the gods i am not able to do the more beast i say
i was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had done t now
commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because i have no power to be kind
and tell him this from me i count it one of my greatest afflictions say that i cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman
good servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him
i ll look you out a good turn servilius
exit servilius true as you said timon is shrunk indeed and he that s once denied will hardly speed
why this is the world s soul and just of the same piece is every flatterer s spirit
who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish
for in my knowing timon has been this lord s father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timon s money has paid his men their wages
he ne er drinks but timon s silver treads upon his lip and yet o see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape he does deny him in respect of his what charitable men afford to beggars
for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor came any of his bounties over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honourable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into donation and the best half should have return d to him so much i love his heart
but i perceive men must learn now with pity to dispense for policy sits above conscience
sempronius house enter sempronius and a servant of timon s sempronius
must he needs trouble me in t
he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus and now ventidius is wealthy too whom he redeem d from prison
all these owe their estates unto him
my lord they have all been touch d and found base metal for they have all denied him
has ventidius and lucullus denied him
and does he send to me
it shows but little love or judgment in him
must i be his last refuge
his friends like physicians thrice give him over
must i take th cure upon me
has much disgrac d me in t i m angry at him that might have known my place
i see no sense for t but his occasions might have woo d me first for in my conscience i was the first man that e er received gift from him
and does he think so backwardly of me now that i ll requite it last
no so it may prove an argument of laughter to th rest and i mongst lords be thought a fool
i d rather than the worth of thrice the sum had sent to me first but for my mind s sake i d such a courage to do him good
but now return and with their faint reply this answer join who bates mine honour shall not know my coin
your lordship s a goodly villain
the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he cross d himself by t and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear
how fairly this lord strives to appear foul
takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire
of such a nature is his politic love
this was my lord s best hope now all are fled save only the gods
now his friends are dead doors that were ne er acquainted with their wards many a bounteous year must be employ d now to guard sure their master
and this is all a liberal course allows who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house
a hall in timon s house enter two of varro s men meeting lucius servant and others all being servants of timon s creditors to wait for his coming out
then enter titus and hortensius first varro s servant
well met good morrow titus and hortensius
the like to you kind varro
ay and i think one business does command us all for mine is money
welcome good brother what do you think the hour
is not my lord seen yet
i wonder on t he was wont to shine at seven
ay but the days are wax d shorter with him you must consider that a prodigal course is like the sun s but not like his recoverable
i fear tis deepest winter in lord timon s purse that is one may reach deep enough and yet find little
i am of your fear for that
i ll show you how t observe a strange event
your lord sends now for money
and he wears jewels now of timon s gift for which i wait for money
mark how strange it shows timon in this should pay more than he owes and e en as if your lord should wear rich jewels and send for money for em
i m weary of this charge the gods can witness i know my lord hath spent of timon s wealth and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
yes mine s three thousand crowns what s yours
tis much deep and it should seem by th sum your master s confidence was above mine else surely his had equall d
one of lord timon s men
pray is my lord ready to come forth
we attend his lordship pray signify so much
i need not tell him that he knows you are to diligent
exit enter flavius in a cloak muffled lucius servant
is not that his steward muffled so
he goes away in a cloud
what do ye ask of me my friend
we wait for certain money here sir
ay if money were as certain as your waiting twere sure enough
why then preferr d you not your sums and bills when your false masters eat of my lord s meat
then they could smile and fawn upon his debts and take down th int rest into their glutt nous maws
you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up let me pass quietly
believe t my lord and i have made an end i have no more to reckon he to spend
ay but this answer will not serve
if twill not serve tis not so base as you for you serve knaves
what does his cashier d worship mutter
no matter what he s poor and that s revenge enough
who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in
such may rail against great buildings
o here s servilius now we shall know some answer
if i might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour i should derive much from t for take t of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent
his comfortable temper has forsook him he s much out of health and keeps his chamber
many do keep their chambers are not sick and if it be so far beyond his health methinks he should the sooner pay his debts and make a clear way to the gods
we cannot take this for answer sir
enter timon in a rage flaminius following timon
what are my doors oppos d against my passage
have i been ever free and must my house be my retentive enemy my gaol
the place which i have feasted does it now like all mankind show me an iron heart
my lord here is my bill
knock me down with em cleave me to the girdle
my lord second varro s servant
tear me take me and the gods fall upon you
faith i perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money
these debts may well be call d desperate ones for a madman owes em
exeunt re enter timon and flavius timon
they have e en put my breath from me the slaves
what if it should be so
go bid all my friends again lucius lucullus and sempronius all
i ll once more feast the rascals
o my lord you only speak from your distracted soul there is not so much left to furnish out a moderate table
be it not in thy care
go i charge thee invite them all let in the tide of knaves once more my cook and i ll provide
exeunt scene v the senate house enter three senators at one door alcibiades meeting them with attendants first senator
my lord you have my voice to t the fault s bloody
tis necessary he should die nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy
most true the law shall bruise him
honour health and compassion to the senate
i am an humble suitor to your virtues for pity is the virtue of the law and none but tyrants use it cruelly
it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy upon a friend of mine who in hot blood hath stepp d into the law which is past depth to those that without heed do plunge into t
he is a man setting his fate aside of comely virtues nor did he soil the fact with cowardice an honour in him which buys out his fault but with a noble fury and fair spirit seeing his reputation touch d to death he did oppose his foe and with such sober and unnoted passion he did behove his anger ere twas spent as if he had but prov d an argument
you undergo too strict a paradox striving to make an ugly deed look fair your words have took such pains as if they labour d to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed is valour misbegot and came into the world when sects and factions were newly born
he s truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs his outsides to wear them like his raiment carelessly and ne er prefer his injuries to his heart to bring it into danger
if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill what folly tis to hazard life for ill
you cannot make gross sins look clear to revenge is no valour but to bear
my lords then under favour pardon me if i speak like a captain why do fond men expose themselves to battle and not endure all threats
sleep upon t and let the foes quietly cut their throats without repugnancy
if there be such valour in the bearing what make we abroad
why then women are more valiant that stay at home if bearing carry it and the ass more captain than the lion the fellow loaden with irons wiser than the judge if wisdom be in suffering
o my lords as you are great be pitifully good
who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
to kill i grant is sin s extremest gust but in defence by mercy tis most just
to be in anger is impiety but who is man that is not angry
weigh but the crime with this
his service done at lacedaemon and byzantium were a sufficient briber for his life
why i say my lords has done fair service and slain in fight many of your enemies how full of valour did he bear himself in the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
he has made too much plenty with em
he s a sworn rioter he has a sin that often drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
if there were no foes that were enough to overcome him
in that beastly fury he has been known to commit outrages and cherish factions
tis inferr d to us his days are foul and his drink dangerous
he might have died in war
my lords if not for any parts in him though his right arm might purchase his own time and be in debt to none yet more to move you take my deserts to his and join em both and for i know your reverend ages love security i ll pawn my victories all my honours to you upon his good returns
if by this crime he owes the law his life why let the war receive t in valiant gore for law is strict and war is nothing more
we are for law he dies
urge it no more on height of our displeasure
friend or brother he forfeits his own blood that spills another
my lords i do beseech you know me
i cannot think but your age has forgot me it could not else be i should prove so base to sue and be denied such common grace
tis in few words but spacious in effect we banish thee for ever
banish usury that makes the senate ugly
if after two days shine athens contain thee attend our weightier judgment
and not to swell our spirit he shall be executed presently
now the gods keep you old enough that you may live only in bone that none may look on you
i m worse than mad i have kept back their foes while they have told their money and let out their coin upon large interest i myself rich only in large hurts
is this the balsam that the usuring senate pours into captains wounds
it comes not ill i hate not to be banish d it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury that i may strike at athens
i ll cheer up my discontented troops and lay for hearts
tis honour with most lands to be at odds soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods
a banqueting hall in timon s house music
enter divers lords friends of timon at several doors first lord
the good time of day to you sir
i also wish it to you
i think this honourable lord did but try us this other day
upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount red
i hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends
it should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting
he hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjur d me beyond them and i must needs appear
in like manner was i in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse
i am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out
i am sick of that grief too as i understand how all things go
what would he have borrowed of you
he sent to me sir here he comes
with all my heart gentlemen both
ever at the best hearing well of your lordship
the swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship
aside nor more willingly leaves winter such summer birds are men gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly o th trumpet s sound we shall to t presently
i hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that i return d you an empty messenger
o sir let it not trouble you
ah my good friend what cheer
my most honourable lord i am e en sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me i was so unfortunate a beggar
if you had sent but two hours before timon
let it not cumber your better remembrance
the banquet brought in come bring in all together
doubt not that if money and the season can yield it
tis so be sure of it
my worthy friends will you draw near
i ll tell you more anon
here s a noble feast toward
this is the old man still
it does but time will and so third lord
each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike
make not a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place
the gods require our thanks you great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness
for your own gifts make yourselves prais d but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised
lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your god heads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods
make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it
let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains
if there sit twelve women at the table let a dozen of them be as they are
the rest of your foes o gods the senators of athens together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make suitable for destruction
for these my present friends as they are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are they welcome
the dishes are uncovered and seen to he full of warm water some speak
may you a better feast never behold you knot of mouth friends
smoke and lukewarm water is your perfection
this is timon s last who stuck and spangled with your flatteries washes it off and sprinkles in your faces throwing the water in their faces your reeking villainy
live loath d and long most smiling smooth detested parasites courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears you fools of fortune trencher friends time s flies cap and knee slaves vapours and minute lacks
of man and beast the infinite malady crust you quite o er
soft take thy physic first thou too and thou
stay i will lend thee money borrow none
throws the dishes at them and drives them out what all in motion
henceforth be no feast whereat a villain s not a welcome guest
henceforth hated be of timon man and all humanity
exit re enter the lords first lord
know you the quality of lord timon s fury
he s but a mad lord and nought but humours sways him
he gave me a jewel th other day and now he has beat it out of my hat
i feel t upon my bones
one day he gives us diamonds next day stones
without the walls of athens enter timon timon
let me look back upon thee
o thou wall that girdles in those wolves dive in the earth and fence not athens
slaves and fools pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench and minister in their steads
to general filths convert o th instant green virginity
do t in your parents eyes
bankrupts hold fast rather than render back out with your knives and cut your trusters throats
bound servants steal large handed robbers your grave masters are and pill by law
maid to thy master s bed thy mistress is o th brothel
son of sixteen pluck the lin d crutch from thy old limping sire with it beat out his brains
piety and fear religion to the gods peace justice truth domestic awe night rest and neighbourhood instruction manners mysteries and trades degrees observances customs and laws decline to your confounding contraries and let confusion live
plagues incident to men your potent and infectious fevers heap on athens ripe for stroke
thou cold sciatica cripple our senators that their limbs may halt as lamely as their manners
lust and liberty creep in the minds and marrows of our youth that gainst the stream of virtue they may strive and drown themselves in riot
itches blains sow all th athenian bosoms and their crop be general leprosy
breath infect breath that their society as their friendship may be merely poison
nothing i ll bear from thee but nakedness thou detestable town
take thou that too with multiplying bans
timon will to the woods where he shall find th unkindest beast more kinder than mankind
the gods confound hear me you good gods all the athenians both within and out that wall
and grant as timon grows his hate may grow to the whole race of mankind high and low
timon s house enter flavius with two or three servants first servant
hear you master steward where s our master
are we undone cast off nothing remaining
alack my fellows what should i say to you
let me be recorded by the righteous gods i am as poor as you
so noble a master fall n
all gone and not one friend to take his fortune by the arm and go along with him
as we do turn our backs from our companion thrown into his grave so his familiars to his buried fortunes slink all away leave their false vows with him like empty purses pick d and his poor self a dedicated beggar to the air with his disease of all shunn d poverty walks like contempt alone
all broken implements of a ruin d house
yet do our hearts wear timon s livery that see i by our faces
we are fellows still serving alike in sorrow
leak d is our bark and we poor mates stand on the dying deck hearing the surges threat
we must all part into this sea of air
good fellows all the latest of my wealth i ll share amongst you
wherever we shall meet for timon s sake let s yet be fellows let s shake our heads and say as twere a knell unto our master s fortune we have seen better days
giving them money nay put out all your hands
thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor
embrace and part several ways o the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
who would not wish to be from wealth exempt since riches point to misery and contempt
who would be so mock d with glory or to live but in a dream of friendship to have his pomp and all what state compounds but only painted like his varnish d friends
poor honest lord brought low by his own heart undone by goodness
strange unusual blood when man s worst sin is he does too much good
who then dares to be half so kind again
for bounty that makes gods does still mar men
my dearest lord blest to be most accurst rich only to be wretched thy great fortunes are made thy chief afflictions
he s flung in rage from this ingrateful seat of monstrous friends nor has he with him to supply his life or that which can command it
i ll follow and enquire him out
i ll ever serve his mind with my best will whilst i have gold i ll be his steward still
the woods near the sea shore
before timon s cave enter timon in the woods timon
o blessed breeding sun draw from the earth rotten humidity below thy sister s orb infect the air
twinn d brothers of one womb whose procreation residence and birth scarce is dividant touch them with several fortunes the greater scorns the lesser
not nature to whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune but by contempt of nature
raise me this beggar and deny t that lord the senator shall bear contempt hereditary the beggar native honour
it is the pasture lards the rother s sides the want that makes him lean
who dares who dares in purity of manhood stand upright and say this man s a flatterer
if one be so are they all for every grise of fortune is smooth d by that below
the learned pate ducks to the golden fool
all s oblique there s nothing level in our cursed natures but direct villainy
therefore be abhorr d all feasts societies and throngs of men
his semblable yea himself timon disdains
digging who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate with thy most operant poison
no gods i am no idle votarist
thus much of this will make black white foul fair wrong right base noble old young coward valiant
why this will lug your priests and servants from your sides pluck stout men s pillows from below their heads this yellow slave will knit and break religions bless th accurs d make the hoar leprosy ador d place thieves and give them title knee and approbation with senators on the bench
this is it that makes the wappen d widow wed again she whom the spital house and ulcerous sores would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices to th april day again
come damn d earth thou common whore of mankind that puts odds among the rout of nations i will make thee do thy right nature
th art quick but yet i ll bury thee
thou t go strong thief when gouty keepers of thee cannot stand
nay stay thou out for earnest
keeping some gold enter alcibiades with drum and fife in warlike manner and phrynia and timandra alcibiades
the canker gnaw thy heart for showing me again the eyes of man
is man so hateful to thee that art thyself a man
i am misanthropos and hate mankind
for thy part i do wish thou wert a dog that i might love thee something
i know thee well but in thy fortunes am unlearn d and strange
i know thee too and more than that i know thee i not desire to know
follow thy drum with man s blood paint the ground gules gules
religious canons civil laws are cruel then what should war be
this fell whore of thine hath in her more destruction than thy sword for all her cherubin look
i will not kiss thee then the rot returns to thine own lips again
how came the noble timon to this change
as the moon does by wanting light to give
but then renew i could not like the moon there were no suns to borrow of
noble timon what friendship may i do thee
none but to maintain my opinion
promise me friendship but perform none
if thou wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art man
if thou dost perform confound thee for thou art a man
i have heard in some sort of thy miseries
thou saw st them when i had prosperity
i see them now then was a blessed time
as thine is now held with a brace of harlots
is this th athenian minion whom the world voic d so regardfully
be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
make use of thy salt hours
season the slaves for tubs and baths bring down rose cheek d youth to the tub fast and the diet
pardon him sweet timandra for his wits are drown d and lost in his calamities
i have but little gold of late brave timon the want whereof doth daily make revolt in my penurious band
i have heard and griev d how cursed athens mindless of thy worth forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states but for thy sword and fortune trod upon them timon
i prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone
i am thy friend and pity thee dear timon
how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
why fare thee well here is some gold for thee
keep it i cannot eat it
when i have laid proud athens on a heap timon
the gods confound them all in thy conquest and thee after when thou hast conquer d
that by killing of villains thou wast born to conquer my country
be as a planetary plague when jove will o er some high vic d city hang his poison in the sick air let not thy sword skip one
pity not honour d age for his white beard he is an usurer
strike me the counterfeit matron it is her habit only that is honest herself s a bawd
let not the virgin s cheek make soft thy trenchant sword for those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men s eyes are not within the leaf of pity writ but set them down horrible traitors
spare not the babe whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy think it a bastard whom the oracle hath doubtfully pronounc d thy throat shall cut and mince it sans remorse
swear against abjects put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding shall pierce a jot
there s gold to pay thy soldiers
make large confusion and thy fury spent confounded be thyself
i ll take the gold thou givest me not all thy counsel
dost thou or dost thou not heaven s curse upon thee
give us some gold good timon
enough to make a whore forswear her trade and to make whores a bawd
hold up you sluts your aprons mountant you are not oathable although i know you ll swear terribly swear into strong shudders and to heavenly agues th immortal gods that hear you
spare your oaths i ll trust to your conditions
be whores still and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you be strong in whore allure him burn him up let your close fire predominate his smoke and be no turncoats
yet may your pains six months be quite contrary
and thatch your poor thin roofs with burdens of the dead some that were hang d no matter
whore still paint till a horse may mire upon your face
believe t that we ll do anything for gold
consumptions sow in hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins and mar men s spurring
crack the lawyer s voice that he may never more false title plead nor sound his quillets shrilly
hoar the flamen that scolds against the quality of flesh and not believes himself
down with the nose down with it flat take the bridge quite away of him that his particular to foresee smells from the general weal
make curl d pate ruffians bald and let the unscarr d braggarts of the war derive some pain from you
plague all that your activity may defeat and quell the source of all erection
do you damn others and let this damn you and ditches grave you all
more counsel with more money bounteous timon
more whore more mischief first i have given you earnest
strike up the drum towards athens
farewell timon if i thrive well i ll visit thee again
if i hope well i ll never see thee more
yes thou spok st well of me
get thee away and take thy beagles with thee
that nature being sick of man s unkindness should yet be hungry
common mother thou digging whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast teems and feeds all whose self same mettle whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff d engenders the black toad and adder blue the gilded newt and eyeless venom d worm with all th abhorred births below crisp heaven whereon hyperion s quick ning fire doth shine yield him who all thy human sons doth hate from forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb let it no more bring out ingrateful man
go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears teem with new monsters whom thy upward face hath to the marbled mansion all above never presented o a root
dear thanks dry up thy marrows vines and plough torn leas whereof ingrateful man with liquorish draughts and morsels unctuous greases his pure mind that from it all consideration slips enter apemantus more man
men report thou dost affect my manners and dost use them
tis then because thou dost not keep a dog whom i would imitate
this is in thee a nature but infected a poor unmanly melancholy sprung from change of fortune
this slave like habit and these looks of care
thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft hug their diseas d perfumes and have forgot that ever timon was
shame not these woods by putting on the cunning of a carper
be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee and let his very breath whom thou lt observe blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain and call it excellent
thou wast told thus thou gav st thine ears like tapsters that bade welcome to knaves and all approachers
tis most just that thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again rascals should have t
were i like thee i d throw away myself
thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself a madman so long now a fool
what think st that the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain will put thy shirt on warm
will these moist trees that have outliv d the eagle page thy heels and skip when thou point st out
will the cold brook candied with ice caudle thy morning taste to cure thy o ernight s surfeit
call the creatures whose naked natures live in all the spite of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks to the conflicting elements expos d answer mere nature bid them flatter thee
i love thee better now than e er i did
i flatter not but say thou art a caitiff
why dost thou seek me out
always a villain s office or a fool s
if thou didst put this sour cold habit on to castigate thy pride twere well but thou dost it enforcedly
thou dst courtier be again wert thou not beggar
willing misery outlives incertain pomp is crown d before
the one is filling still never complete the other at high wish
best state contentless hath a distracted and most wretched being worse than the worst content
thou should st desire to die being miserable
not by his breath that is more miserable
thou art a slave whom fortune s tender arm with favour never clasp d but bred a dog
hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded the sweet degrees that this brief world affords to such as may the passive drugs of it freely command thou wouldst have plung d thyself in general riot melted down thy youth in different beds of lust and never learn d the icy precepts of respect but followed the sug red game before thee
but myself who had the world as my confectionary the mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men at duty more than i could frame employment that numberless upon me stuck as leaves do on the oak have with one winter s brush fell from their boughs and left me open bare for every storm that blows i to bear this that never knew but better is some burden
thy nature did commence in sufferance time hath made thee hard in t
if thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag must be thy subject who in spite put stuff to some she beggar and compounded thee poor rogue hereditary
if thou hadst not been born the worst of men thou hadst been a knave and flatterer
ay that i am not thee
i that i was no prodigal
i that i am one now
were all the wealth i have shut up in thee i d give thee leave to hang it
that the whole life of athens were in this
first mend my company take away thyself
so i shall mend mine own by th lack of thine
tis not well mended so it is but botch d
if not i would it were
what wouldst thou have to athens
if thou wilt tell them there i have gold look so i have
here is no use for gold
the best and truest for here it sleeps and does no hired harm
where feed st thou a days apemantus
finds meat or rather where i eat it
would poison were obedient and knew my mind
the middle of humanity thou never knewest but the extremity of both ends
when thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume they mock d thee for too much curiosity in thy rags thou know st none but art despis d for the contrary
there s a medlar for thee eat it
on what i hate i feed not
ay though it look like thee
an th hadst hated medlars sooner thou shouldst have loved thyself better now
what man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means
who without those means thou talk st of didst thou ever know belov d
i understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog
what things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers
women nearest but men men are the things themselves
what wouldst thou do with the world apemantus if it lay in thy power
give it the beasts to be rid of the men
wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts
a beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t attain to
if thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accus d by the ass
if thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and still thou liv dst but as a breakfast to the wolf
if thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner
wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury
wert thou bear thou wouldst be kill d by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seiz d by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life
all thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence
what beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast
and what beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation
if thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou mightst have hit upon it here
the commonwealth of athens is become a forest of beasts
how has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city
yonder comes a poet and a painter
the plague of company light upon thee
i will fear to catch it and give way
when i know not what else to do i ll see thee again
when there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome
i had rather be a beggar s dog than apemantus
thou art the cap of all the fools alive
would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
thou art too bad to curse
all villains that do stand by thee are pure
there is no leprosy but what thou speak st
i ll beat thee but i should infect my hands
i would my tongue could rot them off
away thou issue of a mangy dog
choler does kill me that thou art alive i swoon to see thee
i am sorry i shall lose a stone by thee
throws a stone at him apemantus
i am sick of this false world and will love nought but even the mere necessities upon t
then timon presently prepare thy grave lie where the light foam of the sea may beat thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph that death in me at others lives may laugh
looks at the gold o thou sweet king killer and dear divorce twixt natural son and sire
thou bright defiler of hymen s purest bed
thou ever young fresh lov d and delicate wooer whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dian s lap
thou visible god that sold rest close impossibilities and mak st them kiss
that speak st with every tongue to every purpose
think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds that beasts may have the world in empire
but not till i am dead
i ll say th hast gold
thou wilt be throng d to shortly
long live so and so die
where should he have this gold
it is some poor fragment some slender ort of his remainder
the mere want of gold and the falling from of his friends drove him into this melancholy
it is nois d he hath a mass of treasure
let us make the assay upon him if he care not for t he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how shall s get it
true for he bears it not about him
both too and women s sons
we are not thieves but men that much do want
your greatest want is you want much of meat
behold the earth hath roots within this mile break forth a hundred springs the oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips the bounteous housewife nature on each bush lays her full mess before you
we cannot live on grass on berries water as beasts and birds and fishes
nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes you must eat men
yet thanks i must you con that you are thieves profess d that you work not in holier shapes for there is boundless theft in limited professions
go suck the subtle blood o th grape till the high fever seethe your blood to froth and so scape hanging
trust not the physician his antidotes are poison and he slays moe than you rob
take wealth and lives together do villainy do since you protest to do t like workmen
i ll example you with thievery the sun s a thief and with his great attraction robs the vast sea the moon s an arrant thief and her pale fire she snatches from the sun the sea s a thief whose liquid surge resolves the moon into salt tears the earth s a thief that feeds and breeds by a composture stol n from gen ral excrement each thing s a thief
the laws your curb and whip in their rough power has uncheck d theft
love not yourselves away rob one another
cut throats all that you meet are thieves
to athens go break open shops nothing can you steal but thieves do lose it
steal not less for this i give you and gold confound you howsoe er
has almost charm d me from my profession by persuading me to it
tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mystery
i ll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade
let us first see peace in athens
there is no time so miserable but a man may be true
exeunt thieves enter flavius to timon flavius
is yond despis d and ruinous man my lord
o monument and wonder of good deeds evilly bestow d
what an alteration of honour has desp rate want made
what viler thing upon the earth than friends who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
how rarely does it meet with this time s guise when man was wish d to love his enemies
grant i may ever love and rather woo those that would mischief me than those that do
has caught me in his eye i will present my honest grief unto him and as my lord still serve him with my life
i have forgot all men then if thou grant st th art a man i have forgot thee
an honest poor servant of yours
i never had honest man about me i
all i kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains
the gods are witness nev r did poor steward wear a truer grief for his undone lord than mine eyes for you
then i love thee because thou art a woman and disclaim st flinty mankind whose eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter
strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
i beg of you to know me good my lord t accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts to entertain me as your steward still
had i a steward so true so just and now so comfortable
it almost turns my dangerous nature mild
surely this man was born of woman
forgive my general and exceptless rashness you perpetual sober gods
i do proclaim one honest man mistake me not but one no more i pray and he s a steward
how fain would i have hated all mankind
but all save thee i fell with curses
methinks thou art more honest now than wise for by oppressing and betraying me thou mightst have sooner got another service for many so arrive at second masters upon their first lord s neck
but tell me true for i must ever doubt though ne er so sure is not thy kindness subtle covetous if not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts expecting in return twenty for one
no my most worthy master in whose breast doubt and suspect alas are plac d too late
you should have fear d false times when you did feast suspect still comes where an estate is least
that which i show heaven knows is merely love duty and zeal to your unmatched mind care of your food and living and believe it my most honour d lord for any benefit that points to me either in hope or present i d exchange for this one wish that you had power and wealth to requite me by making rich yourself
thou singly honest man here take
the gods out of my misery have sent thee treasure
go live rich and happy but thus condition d thou shalt build from men hate all curse all show charity to none but let the famish d flesh slide from the bone ere thou relieve the beggar
give to dogs what thou deniest to men let prisons swallow em debts wither em to nothing
be men like blasted woods and may diseases lick up their false bloods
o let me stay and comfort you my master
if thou hat st curses stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free
ne er see thou man and let me ne er see thee
exeunt severally act v scene i
before timon s cave enter poet and painter painter
as i took note of the place it cannot be far where he abides
does the rumour hold for true that he s so full of gold
alcibiades reports it phrynia and timandra had gold of him
he likewise enrich d poor straggling soldiers with great quantity
tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum
then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
you shall see him a palm in athens again and flourish with the highest
therefore tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this suppos d distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be just and true report that goes of his having
what have you now to present unto him
nothing at this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece
i must serve him so too tell him of an intent that s coming toward him
promising is the very air o th time it opens the eyes of expectation
performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use
to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it
enter timon from his cave timon
thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself
i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him
it must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency
aside must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work
wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men
do so i have gold for thee
nay let s seek him then do we sin against our own estate when we may profit meet and come too late
true when the day serves before black corner d night find what thou want st by free and offer d light
aside i ll meet you at the turn
what a god s gold that he is worshipp d in a baser temple than where swine feed
tis thou that rig st the bark and plough st the foam settlest admired reverence in a slave
and thy saints for aye be crown d with plagues that thee alone obey
have i once liv d to see two honest men
sir having often of your open bounty tasted hearing you were retir d your friends fall n off whose thankless natures o abhorred spirits not all the whips of heaven are large enough what
to you whose star like nobleness gave life and influence to their whole being
i am rapt and cannot cover the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude with any size of words
let it go naked men may see t the better
you that are honest by being what you are make them best seen and known
he and myself have travail d in the great show r of your gifts and sweetly felt it
we are hither come to offer you our service
why how shall i requite you
can you eat roots and drink cold water no
what we can do we ll do to do you service
y have heard that i have gold i am sure you have
speak truth y are honest men
so it is said my noble lord but therefore came not my friend nor i timon
thou draw st a counterfeit best in all athens
th art indeed the best thou counterfeit st most lively
e en so sir as i say
to to poet and for thy fiction why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth that thou art even natural in thine art
but for all this my honest natur d friends i must needs say you have a little fault
marry tis not monstrous in you neither wish i you take much pains to mend
beseech your honour to make it known to us
there s never a one of you but trusts a knave that mightily deceives you
ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble know his gross patchery love him feed him keep in your bosom yet remain assur d that he s a made up villain
i know not such my lord
look you i love you well i ll give you gold rid me these villains from your companies
hang them or stab them drown them in a draught confound them by some course and come to me i ll give you gold enough
name them my lord let s know them
you that way and you this but two in company each man apart all single and alone yet an arch villain keeps him company
to the painter if where thou art two villians shall not be come not near him
to the poet if thou wouldst not reside but where one villain is then him abandon hence pack
there s gold you came for gold ye slaves
to the painter you have work for me there s payment hence
to the poet you are an alchemist make gold of that out rascal dogs
beats and drives them out enter flavius and two senators flavius
it is vain that you would speak with timon for he is set so only to himself that nothing but himself which looks like man is friendly with him
it is our part and promise to th athenians to speak with timon
at all times alike men are not still the same twas time and griefs that fram d him thus
time with his fairer hand offering the fortunes of his former days the former man may make him
bring us to him and chance it as it may
look out and speak to friends
th athenians by two of their most reverend senate greet thee
enter timon out of his cave timon
for each true word a blister and each false be as a cauterizing to the root o th tongue consuming it with speaking
of none but such as you and you of timon
the senators of athens greet thee timon
i thank them and would send them back the plague could i but catch it for them
o forget what we are sorry for ourselves in thee
the senators with one consent of love entreat thee back to athens who have thought on special dignities which vacant lie for thy best use and wearing
they confess toward thee forgetfulness too general gross which now the public body which doth seldom play the recanter feeling in itself a lack of timon s aid hath sense withal of it own fail restraining aid to timon and send forth us to make their sorrowed render together with a recompense more fruitful than their offence can weigh down by the dram ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs and write in thee the figures of their love ever to read them thine
you witch me in it surprise me to the very brink of tears
lend me a fool s heart and a woman s eyes and i ll beweep these comforts worthy senators
therefore so please thee to return with us and of our athens thine and ours to take the captainship thou shalt be met with thanks allow d with absolute power and thy good name live with authority
so soon we shall drive back of alcibiades th approaches wild who like a boar too savage doth root up his country s peace
and shakes his threat ning sword against the walls of athens
therefore i will sir thus if alcibiades kill my countrymen let alcibiades know this of timon that timon cares not
but if he sack fair athens and take our goodly aged men by th beards giving our holy virgins to the stain of contumelious beastly mad brain d war then let him know and tell him timon speaks it in pity of our aged and our youth i cannot choose but tell him that i care not and let him take t at worst for their knives care not while you have throats to answer
for myself there s not a whittle in th unruly camp but i do prize it at my love before the reverend st throat in athens
so i leave you to the protection of the prosperous gods as thieves to keepers
stay not all s in vain
why i was writing of my epitaph it will be seen to morrow
my long sickness of health and living now begins to mend and nothing brings me all things
go live still be alcibiades your plague you his and last so long enough
but yet i love my country and am not one that rejoices in the common wreck as common bruit doth put it
commend me to my loving countrymen first senator
these words become your lips as they pass through them
and enter in our ears like great triumphers in their applauding gates
commend me to them and tell them that to ease them of their griefs their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses their pangs of love with other incident throes that nature s fragile vessel doth sustain in life s uncertain voyage i will some kindness do them i ll teach them to prevent wild alcibiades wrath
i like this well he will return again
i have a tree which grows here in my close that mine own use invites me to cut down and shortly must i fell it
tell my friends tell athens in the sequence of degree from high to low throughout that whoso please to stop affliction let him take his haste come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe and hang himself
i pray you do my greeting
trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
come not to me again but say to athens timon hath made his everlasting mansion upon the beached verge of the salt flood who once a day with his embossed froth the turbulent surge shall cover
thither come and let my gravestone be your oracle
lips let sour words go by and language end what is amiss plague and infection mend
graves only be men s works and death their gain
exit timon into his cave first senator
his discontents are unremovably coupled to nature
our hope in him is dead
let us return and strain what other means is left unto us in our dear peril
before the walls of athens enter two other senators with a messenger first senator
thou hast painfully discover d are his files as full as thy report
besides his expedition promises present approach
we stand much hazard if they bring not timon
i met a courier one mine ancient friend whom though in general part we were oppos d yet our old love had a particular force and made us speak like friends
this man was riding from alcibiades to timon s cave with letters of entreaty which imported his fellowship i th cause against your city in part for his sake mov d
enter the other senators from timon first senator
no talk of timon nothing of him expect
the enemies drum is heard and fearful scouring doth choke the air with dust
ours is the fall i fear our foes the snare
the timon s cave and a rude tomb seen enter a soldier in the woods seeking timon soldier
by all description this should be the place
timon is dead who hath outstretch d his span
some beast rear d this here does not live a man
dead sure and this his grave
what s on this tomb i cannot read the character i ll take with wax
our captain hath in every figure skill an ag d interpreter though young in days before proud athens he s set down by this whose fall the mark of his ambition is
before the walls of athens trumpets sound
enter alcibiades with his powers before athens alcibiades
sound to this coward and lascivious town our terrible approach
the senators appear upon the walls till now you have gone on and fill d the time with all licentious measure making your wills the scope of justice till now myself and such as slept within the shadow of your power have wander d with our travers d arms and breath d our sufferance vainly
now the time is flush when crouching marrow in the bearer strong cries of itself no more
now breathless wrong shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease and pursy insolence shall break his wind with fear and horrid flight
noble and young when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear we sent to thee to give thy rages balm to wipe out our ingratitude with loves above their quantity
so did we woo transformed timon to our city s love by humble message and by promis d means
we were not all unkind nor all deserve the common stroke of war
these walls of ours were not erected by their hands from whom you have receiv d your griefs nor are they such that these great tow rs trophies and schools should fall for private faults in them
nor are they living who were the motives that you first went out shame that they wanted cunning in excess hath broke their hearts
march noble lord into our city with thy banners spread
by decimation and a tithed death if thy revenges hunger for that food which nature loathes take thou the destin d tenth and by the hazard of the spotted die let die the spotted
all have not offended for those that were it is not square to take on those that are revenge crimes like lands are not inherited
then dear countryman bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage spare thy athenian cradle and those kin which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall with those that have offended
like a shepherd approach the fold and cull th infected forth but kill not all together
what thou wilt thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile than hew to t with thy sword
set but thy foot against our rampir d gates and they shall ope so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before to say thou t enter friendly
throw thy glove or any token of thine honour else that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress and not as our confusion all thy powers shall make their harbour in our town till we have seal d thy full desire
then there s my glove descend and open your uncharged ports
those enemies of timon s and mine own whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof fall and no more
and to atone your fears with my more noble meaning not a man shall pass his quarter or offend the stream of regular justice in your city s bounds but shall be render d to your public laws at heaviest answer
the senators descend and open the gates enter a soldier as a messenger soldier
my noble general timon is dead entomb d upon the very hem o th sea and on his grave stone this insculpture which with wax i brought away whose soft impression interprets for my poor ignorance
alcibiades reads the epitaph here lies a wretched corse of wretched soul bereft seek not my name
a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left
here lie i timon who alive all living men did hate
pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy gait
these well express in thee thy latter spirits
though thou abhorr dst in us our human griefs scorn dst our brain s flow and those our droplets which from niggard nature fall yet rich conceit taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye on thy low grave on faults forgiven
dead is noble timon of whose memory hereafter more
bring me into your city and i will use the olive with my sword make war breed peace make peace stint war make each prescribe to other as each other s leech
enter the tribunes and senators aloft and then enter below saturninus and his followers at one door and bassianus and his followers at the other with drums and trumpets saturninus
noble patricians patrons of my right defend the justice of my cause with arms and countrymen my loving followers plead my successive title with your swords
i am his first born son that was the last that ware the imperial diadem of rome then let my father s honours live in me nor wrong mine age with this indignity
romans friends followers favourers of my right if ever bassianus caesar s son were gracious in the eyes of royal rome keep then this passage to the capitol and suffer not dishonour to approach the imperial seat to virtue consecrate to justice continence and nobility but let desert in pure election shine and romans fight for freedom in your choice
enter marcus andronicus aloft with the crown marcus
princes that strive by factions and by friends ambitiously for rule and empery know that the people of rome for whom we stand a special party have by common voice in election for the roman empery chosen andronicus surnamed pius for many good and great deserts to rome
a nobler man a braver warrior lives not this day within the city walls
he by the senate is accited home from weary wars against the barbarous goths that with his sons a terror to our foes hath yok d a nation strong train d up in arms
ten years are spent since first he undertook this cause of rome and chastised with arms our enemies pride five times he hath return d bleeding to rome bearing his valiant sons in coffins from the field and at this day to the monument of that andronici done sacrifice of expiation and slain the noblest prisoner of the goths
and now at last laden with honour s spoils returns the good andronicus to rome renowned titus flourishing in arms
let us entreat by honour of his name whom worthily you would have now succeed and in the capitol and senate s right whom you pretend to honour and adore that you withdraw you and abate your strength dismiss your followers and as suitors should plead your deserts in peace and humbleness
how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts
marcus andronicus so i do affy in thy uprightness and integrity and so i love and honour thee and thine thy noble brother titus and his sons and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all gracious lavinia rome s rich ornament that i will here dismiss my loving friends and to my fortunes and the people s favour commit my cause in balance to be weigh d
exeunt the soldiers of bassianus saturninus
friends that have been thus forward in my right i thank you all and here dismiss you all and to the love and favour of my country commit myself my person and the cause
exeunt the soldiers of saturninus rome be as just and gracious unto me as i am confident and kind to thee
open the gates and let me in
tribunes and me a poor competitor
they go up into the senate house enter a captain captain
the good andronicus patron of virtue rome s best champion successful in the battles that he fights with honour and with fortune is return d from where he circumscribed with his sword and brought to yoke the enemies of rome
sound drums and trumpets and then enter martius and mutius two of titus sons and then two men bearing a coffin covered with black then lucius and quintus two other sons then titus andronicus and then tamora the queen of goths with her three sons alarbus demetrius and chiron with aaron the moor and others as many as can be
then set down the coffin and titus speaks titus
hail rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
lo as the bark that hath discharg d her fraught returns with precious lading to the bay from whence at first she weigh d her anchorage cometh andronicus bound with laurel boughs to re salute his country with his tears tears of true joy for his return to rome
thou great defender of this capitol stand gracious to the rites that we intend
romans of five and twenty valiant sons half of the number that king priam had behold the poor remains alive and dead
these that survive let rome reward with love these that i bring unto their latest home with burial amongst their ancestors
here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
titus unkind and careless of thine own why suffer st thou thy sons unburied yet to hover on the dreadful shore of styx
make way to lay them by their brethren
they open the tomb there greet in silence as the dead are wont and sleep in peace slain in your country s wars
o sacred receptacle of my joys sweet cell of virtue and nobility how many sons hast thou of mine in store that thou wilt never render to me more
give us the proudest prisoner of the goths that we may hew his limbs and on a pile ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh before this earthy prison of their bones that so the shadows be not unappeas d nor we disturb d with prodigies on earth
i give him you the noblest that survives the eldest son of this distressed queen
gracious conqueror victorious titus rue the tears i shed a mother s tears in passion for her son and if thy sons were ever dear to thee o think my son to be as dear to me
sufficeth not that we are brought to rome to beautify thy triumphs and return captive to thee and to thy roman yoke but must my sons be slaughtered in the streets for valiant doings in their country s cause
o if to fight for king and commonweal were piety in thine it is in these
andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
draw near them then in being merciful
sweet mercy is nobility s true badge
thrice noble titus spare my first born son
patient yourself madam and pardon me
these are their brethren whom your goths beheld alive and dead and for their brethren slain religiously they ask a sacrifice
to this your son is mark d and die he must t appease their groaning shadows that are gone
away with him and make a fire straight and with our swords upon a pile of wood let s hew his limbs till they be clean consum d
exeunt titus sons with alarbus tamora
was never scythia half so barbarous
oppose not scythia to ambitious rome
alarbus goes to rest and we survive to tremble under titus threat ning look
then madam stand resolv d but hope withal the self same gods that arm d the queen of troy with opportunity of sharp revenge upon the thracian tyrant in his tent may favour tamora the queen of goths when goths were goths and tamora was queen to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes
re enter lucius quintus martius and mutius the sons of andronicus with their swords bloody lucius
see lord and father how we have perform d our roman rites alarbus limbs are lopp d and entrails feed the sacrificing fire whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
remaineth nought but to inter our brethren and with loud larums welcome them to rome
let it be so and let andronicus make this his latest farewell to their souls
sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb in peace and honour rest you here my sons rome s readiest champions repose you here in rest secure from worldly chances and mishaps
here lurks no treason here no envy swells here grow no damned drugs here are no storms no noise but silence and eternal sleep
in peace and honour rest you here my sons
in peace and honour live lord titus long my noble lord and father live in fame
lo at this tomb my tributary tears i render for my brethren s obsequies and at thy feet i kneel with tears of joy shed on this earth for thy return to rome
o bless me here with thy victorious hand whose fortunes rome s best citizens applaud
kind rome that hast thus lovingly reserv d the cordial of mine age to glad my heart
lavinia live outlive thy father s days and fame s eternal date for virtue s praise
enter above marcus andronicus and tribunes re enter saturninus bassianus and attendants marcus
long live lord titus my beloved brother gracious triumpher in the eyes of rome
thanks gentle tribune noble brother marcus
and welcome nephews from successful wars you that survive and you that sleep in fame
fair lords your fortunes are alike in all that in your country s service drew your swords but safer triumph is this funeral pomp that hath aspir d to solon s happiness and triumphs over chance in honour s bed
titus andronicus the people of rome whose friend in justice thou hast ever been send thee by me their tribune and their trust this par iament of white and spotless hue and name thee in election for the empire with these our late deceased emperor s sons be candidatus then and put it on and help to set a head on headless rome
a better head her glorious body fits than his that shakes for age and feebleness
what should i don this robe and trouble you
be chosen with proclamations to day to morrow yield up rule resign my life and set abroad new business for you all
rome i have been thy soldier forty years and led my country s strength successfully and buried one and twenty valiant sons knighted in field slain manfully in arms in right and service of their noble country
give me a staff of honour for mine age but not a sceptre to control the world
upright he held it lords that held it last
titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery
proud and ambitious tribune canst thou tell
patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not till saturninus be rome s emperor
andronicus would thou were shipp d to hell rather than rob me of the people s hearts
proud saturnine interrupter of the good that noble minded titus means to thee
content thee prince i will restore to thee the people s hearts and wean them from themselves
andronicus i do not flatter thee but honour thee and will do till i die
my faction if thou strengthen with thy friends i will most thankful be and thanks to men of noble minds is honourable meed
people of rome and people s tribunes here i ask your voices and your suffrages will ye bestow them friendly on andronicus
to gratify the good andronicus and gratulate his safe return to rome the people will accept whom he admits
tribunes i thank you and this suit i make that you create our emperor s eldest son lord saturnine whose virtues will i hope reflect on rome as titan s rays on earth and ripen justice in this commonweal
then if you will elect by my advice crown him and say long live our emperor
with voices and applause of every sort patricians and plebeians we create lord saturninus rome s great emperor and say long live our emperor saturnine
a long flourish till they come down saturninus
titus andronicus for thy favours done to us in our election this day i give thee thanks in part of thy deserts and will with deeds requite thy gentleness and for an onset titus to advance thy name and honourable family lavinia will i make my emperess rome s royal mistress mistress of my heart and in the sacred pantheon her espouse
tell me andronicus doth this motion please thee
it doth my worthy lord and in this match i hold me highly honoured of your grace and here in sight of rome to saturnine king and commander of our commonweal the wide world s emperor do i consecrate my sword my chariot and my prisoners presents well worthy rome s imperious lord receive them then the tribute that i owe mine honour s ensigns humbled at thy feet
thanks noble titus father of my life
how proud i am of thee and of thy gifts rome shall record and when i do forget the least of these unspeakable deserts romans forget your fealty to me
to tamora now madam are you prisoner to an emperor to him that for your honour and your state will use you nobly and your followers
aside a goodly lady trust me of the hue that i would choose were i to choose anew clear up fair queen that cloudy countenance though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer thou com st not to be made a scorn in rome princely shall be thy usage every way
rest on my word and let not discontent daunt all your hopes
madam he comforts you can make you greater than the queen of goths
lavinia you are not displeas d with this
not i my lord sith true nobility warrants these words in princely courtesy
ransomless here we set our prisoners free
proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum
lord titus by your leave this maid is mine
are you in earnest then my lord
ay noble titus and resolv d withal to do myself this reason and this right
suum cuique is our roman justice this prince in justice seizeth but his own
and that he will and shall if lucius live
where is the emperor s guard
treason my lord lavinia is surpris d
by him that justly may bear his betroth d from all the world away
exeunt bassianus and marcus with lavinia mutius
brothers help to convey her hence away and with my sword i ll keep this door safe
exeunt lucius quintus and martius titus
follow my lord and i ll soon bring her back
my lord you pass not here
bar st me my way in rome
during the fray exeunt saturninus tamora demetrius chiron and aaron re enter lucius lucius
my lord you are unjust and more than so in wrongful quarrel you have slain your son
nor thou nor he are any sons of mine my sons would never so dishonour me
re enter aloft the emperor with tamora and her two sons and aaron the moor traitor restore lavinia to the emperor
dead if you will but not to be his wife that is another s lawful promis d love
no titus no the emperor needs her not nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock
i ll trust by leisure him that mocks me once thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons confederates all thus to dishonour me
was there none else in rome to make a stale but saturnine
full well andronicus agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine that saidst i begg d the empire at thy hands
but go thy ways go give that changing piece to him that flourish d for her with his sword
a valiant son in law thou shalt enjoy one fit to bandy with thy lawless sons to ruffle in the commonwealth of rome
these words are razors to my wounded heart
and therefore lovely tamora queen of goths that like the stately phoebe mongst her nymphs dost overshine the gallant st dames of rome if thou be pleas d with this my sudden choice behold i choose thee tamora for my bride and will create thee emperess of rome
speak queen of goths dost thou applaud my choice
and here i swear by all the roman gods sith priest and holy water are so near and tapers burn so bright and everything in readiness for hymenaeus stand i will not re salute the streets of rome or climb my palace till from forth this place i lead espous d my bride along with me
and here in sight of heaven to rome i swear if saturnine advance the queen of goths she will a handmaid be to his desires a loving nurse a mother to his youth
lords accompany your noble emperor and his lovely bride sent by the heavens for prince saturnine whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered there shall we consummate our spousal rites
i am not bid to wait upon this bride
titus when wert thou wont to walk alone dishonoured thus and challenged of wrongs
re enter marcus and titus sons lucius quintus and martius marcus
o titus see o see what thou hast done
in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son
no foolish tribune no no son of mine nor thou nor these confederates in the deed that hath dishonoured all our family unworthy brother and unworthy sons
but let us give him burial as becomes give mutius burial with our bretheren
he rests not in this tomb
this monument five hundred years hath stood which i have sumptuously re edified here none but soldiers and rome s servitors repose in fame none basely slain in brawls
bury him where you can he comes not here
my lord this is impiety in you
my nephew mutius deeds do plead for him he must be buried with his bretheren
and shall or him we will accompany
what villain was it spake that word
he that would vouch it in any place but here
what would you bury him in my despite
no noble titus but entreat of thee to pardon mutius and to bury him
marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest and with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
my foes i do repute you every one so trouble me no more but get you gone
he is not with himself let us withdraw
not i till mutius bones be buried
the brother and the sons kneel marcus
brother for in that name doth nature plead quintus
father and in that name doth nature speak titus
speak thou no more if all the rest will speed
renowned titus more than half my soul lucius
dear father soul and substance of us all marcus
suffer thy brother marcus to inter his noble nephew here in virtue s nest that died in honour and lavinia s cause
thou art a roman be not barbarous
the greeks upon advice did bury ajax that slew himself and wise laertes son did graciously plead for his funerals
let not young mutius then that was thy joy be barr d his entrance here
rise marcus rise the dismal st day is this that e er i saw to be dishonoured by my sons in rome
well bury him and bury me the next
they put mutius in the tomb lucius
there lie thy bones sweet mutius with thy friends till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb
kneeling no man shed tears for noble mutius he lives in fame that died in virtue s cause
my lord to step out of these dreary dumps how comes it that the subtle queen of goths is of a sudden thus advanc d in rome
i know not marcus but i know it is whether by device or no the heavens can tell
is she not then beholding to the man that brought her for this high good turn so far
yes and will nobly him remunerate
re enter the emperor tamora and her two sons with the moor at one door at the other door bassianus and lavinia with others saturninus
so bassianus you have play d your prize god give you joy sir of your gallant bride
and you of yours my lord
i say no more nor wish no less and so i take my leave
traitor if rome have law or we have power thou and thy faction shall repent this rape
rape call you it my lord to seize my own my true betrothed love and now my wife
but let the laws of rome determine all meanwhile am i possess d of that is mine
you are very short with us but if we live we ll be as sharp with you
my lord what i have done as best i may answer i must and shall do with my life
only thus much i give your grace to know by all the duties that i owe to rome this noble gentleman lord titus here is in opinion and in honour wrong d that in the rescue of lavinia with his own hand did slay his youngest son in zeal to you and highly mov d to wrath to be controll d in that he frankly gave
receive him then to favour saturnine that hath express d himself in all his deeds a father and a friend to thee and rome
prince bassianus leave to plead my deeds
tis thou and those that have dishonoured me
rome and the righteous heavens be my judge how i have lov d and honoured saturnine
my worthy lord if ever tamora were gracious in those princely eyes of thine then hear me speak indifferently for all and at my suit sweet pardon what is past
be dishonoured openly and basely put it up without revenge
not so my lord the gods of rome forfend i should be author to dishonour you
but on mine honour dare i undertake for good lord titus innocence in all whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs
then at my suit look graciously on him lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart
aside to saturninus my lord be rul d by me be won at last dissemble all your griefs and discontents
take up this good old man and cheer the heart that dies in tempest of thy angry frown
rise titus rise my empress hath prevail d
i thank your majesty and her my lord these words these looks infuse new life in me
titus i am incorporate in rome a roman now adopted happily and must advise the emperor for his good
this day all quarrels die andronicus and let it be mine honour good my lord that i have reconcil d your friends and you
for you prince bassianus i have pass d my word and promise to the emperor that you will be more mild and tractable
and fear not lords and you lavinia
by my advice all humbled on your knees you shall ask pardon of his majesty
we do and vow to heaven and to his highness that what we did was mildly as we might tend ring our sister s honour and our own
that on mine honour here do i protest
away and talk not trouble us no more
nay nay sweet emperor we must all be friends
the tribune and his nephews kneel for grace
marcus for thy sake and thy brother s here and at my lovely tamora s entreats i do remit these young men s heinous faults
lavinia though you left me like a churl i found a friend and sure as death i swore i would not part a bachelor from the priest
come if the emperor s court can feast two brides you are my guest lavinia and your friends
this day shall be a love day tamora
to morrow and it please your majesty to hunt the panther and the hart with me with horn and hound we ll give your grace bonjour
be it so titus and gramercy too
before the palace enter aaron aaron
now climbeth tamora olympus top safe out of fortune s shot and sits aloft secure of thunder s crack or lightning flash advanc d above pale envy s threat ning reach
as when the golden sun salutes the morn and having gilt the ocean with his beams gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach and overlooks the highest peering hills so tamora
upon her wit doth earthly honour wait and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
then aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
hast prisoner held fett red in amorous chains and faster bound to aaron s charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus
away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
i will be bright and shine in pearl and gold to wait upon this new made emperess
to wanton with this queen this goddess this semiramis this nymph this siren that will charm rome s saturnine and see his shipwreck and his commonweal s
enter chiron and demetrius braving demetrius
chiron thy years wants wit thy wits wants edge and manners to intrude where i am grac d and may for aught thou knowest affected be
demetrius thou dost over ween in all and so in this to bear me down with braves
tis not the difference of a year or two makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate i am as able and as fit as thou to serve and to deserve my mistress grace and that my sword upon thee shall approve and plead my passions for lavinia s love
these lovers will not keep the peace
why boy although our mother unadvis d gave you a dancing rapier by your side are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
go to have your lath glued within your sheath till you know better how to handle it
meanwhile sir with the little skill i have full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare
ay boy grow ye so brave
coming forward why how now lords
so near the emperor s palace dare ye draw and maintain such a quarrel openly
full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonoured in the court of rome
not i till i have sheath d my rapier in his bosom and withal thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat that he hath breath d in my dishonour here
for that i am prepar d and full resolv d foul spoken coward that thund rest with thy tongue and with thy weapon nothing dar st perform
now by the gods that warlike goths adore this pretty brabble will undo us all
why lords and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince s right
what is lavinia then become so loose or bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels may be broach d without controlment justice or revenge
young lords beware an should the empress know this discord s ground the music would not please
i care not i knew she and all the world i love lavinia more than all the world
youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice lavina is thine elder brother s hope
why are ye mad or know ye not in rome how furious and impatient they be and cannot brook competitors in love
i tell you lords you do but plot your deaths by this device
aaron a thousand deaths would i propose to achieve her whom i love
why mak st thou it so strange
she is a woman therefore may be woo d she is a woman therefore may be won she is lavinia therefore must be lov d
more water glideth by the mill than wots the miller of and easy it is of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
though bassianus be the emperor s brother better than he have worn vulcan s badge
aside ay and as good as saturninus may
then why should he despair that knows to court it with words fair looks and liberality
what hast not thou full often struck a doe and borne her cleanly by the keeper s nose
why then it seems some certain snatch or so would serve your turns
ay so the turn were served
would you had hit it too
then should not we be tir d with this ado
and are you such fools to square for this
would it offend you then that both should speed
nor me so i were one
for shame be friends and join for that you jar
tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect and so must you resolve that what you cannot as you would achieve you must perforce accomplish as you may
take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia bassianus love
a speedier course than ling ring languishment must we pursue and i have found the path
my lords a solemn hunting is in hand there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villainy
single you thither then this dainty doe and strike her home by force if not by words
this way or not at all stand you in hope
come come our empress with her sacred wit to villainy and vengeance consecrate will we acquaint with all what we intend and she shall file our engines with advice that will not suffer you to square yourselves but to your wishes height advance you both
the emperor s court is like the house of fame the palace full of tongues of eyes and ears the woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
there speak and strike brave boys and take your turns there serve your lust shadowed from heaven s eye and revel in lavinia s treasury
thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice
sit fas aut nefas till i find the stream to cool this heat a charm to calm these fits per styga per manes vehor
a forest near rome enter titus andronicus and his three sons lucius quintus martius making a noise with hounds and horns and marcus titus
the hunt is up the morn is bright and grey the fields are fragrant and the woods are green
uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter s peal that all the court may echo with the noise
sons let it be your charge as it is ours to attend the emperor s person carefully
i have been troubled in my sleep this night but dawning day new comfort hath inspir d
here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal
then enter saturninus tamora bassianus lavinia chiron demetrius and their attendants many good morrows to your majesty
madam to you as many and as good
i promised your grace a hunter s peal
and you have rung it lustily my lords somewhat too early for new married ladies
i say no i have been broad awake two hours and more
come on then horse and chariots let us have and to our sport
to tamora madam now shall ye see our roman hunting
i have dogs my lord will rouse the proudest panther in the chase and climb the highest promontory top
and i have horse will follow where the game makes way and run like swallows o er the plain
chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground
a lonely part of the forest enter aaron alone with a bag of gold aaron
he that had wit would think that i had none to bury so much gold under a tree and never after to inherit it
let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem which cunningly effected will beget a very excellent piece of villainy
and so repose sweet gold for their unrest hides the gold that have their alms out of the empress chest
enter tamora alone to the moor tamora
my lovely aaron wherefore look st thou sad when everything does make a gleeful boast
madam though venus govern your desires saturn is dominator over mine
what signifies my deadly standing eye my silence and my cloudy melancholy my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution
no madam these are no venereal signs
vengeance is in my heart death in my hand blood and revenge are hammering in my head
hark tamora the empress of my soul which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue to day thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus blood
take it up i pray thee and give the king this fatal plotted scroll
now question me no more we are espied
here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty which dreads not yet their lives destruction
ah my sweet moor sweeter to me than life
no more great empress bassianus comes
be cross with him and i ll go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels whatsoe er they be
rome s royal emperess unfurnish d of her well beseeming troop
or is it dian habited like her who hath abandoned her holy groves to see the general hunting in this forest
saucy controller of my private steps
had i the pow r that some say dian had thy temples should be planted presently with horns as was actaeon s and the hounds should drive upon thy new transformed limbs unmannerly intruder as thou art
under your patience gentle emperess tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning and to be doubted that your moor and you are singled forth to try thy experiments
jove shield your husband from his hounds to day
tis pity they should take him for a stag
believe me queen your swarth cimmerian doth make your honour of his body s hue spotted detested and abominable
why are you sequest red from all your train dismounted from your snow white goodly steed and wand red hither to an obscure plot accompanied but with a barbarous moor if foul desire had not conducted you
and being intercepted in your sport great reason that my noble lord be rated for sauciness
i pray you let us hence and let her joy her raven coloured love this valley fits the purpose passing well
the king my brother shall have notice of this
ay for these slips have made him noted long
good king to be so mightily abused
why i have patience to endure all this
how now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
why doth your highness look so pale and wan
have i not reason think you to look pale
these two have ticed me hither to this place
a barren detested vale you see it is the trees though summer yet forlorn and lean overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe here never shines the sun here nothing breeds unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
and when they show d me this abhorred pit they told me here at dead time of the night a thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins would make such fearful and confused cries as any mortal body hearing it should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
no sooner had they told this hellish tale but straight they told me they would bind me here unto the body of a dismal yew and leave me to this miserable death
and then they call d me foul adulteress lascivious goth and all the bitterest terms that ever ear did hear to such effect and had you not by wondrous fortune come this vengeance on me had they executed
revenge it as you love your mother s life or be ye not henceforth call d my children
this is a witness that i am thy son
and this for me struck home to show my strength
ay come semiramis nay barbarous tamora for no name fits thy nature but thy own
give me the poniard you shall know my boys your mother s hand shall right your mother s wrong
stay madam here is more belongs to her first thrash the corn then after burn the straw
this minion stood upon her chastity upon her nuptial vow her loyalty and with that painted hope braves your mightiness and shall she carry this unto her grave
an if she do i would i were an eunuch
drag hence her husband to some secret hole and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
but when ye have the honey we desire let not this wasp outlive us both to sting
i warrant you madam we will make that sure
come mistress now perforce we will enjoy that nice preserved honesty of yours
thou bearest a woman s face tamora
i will not hear her speak away with her
sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
listen fair madam let it be your glory to see her tears but be your heart to them as unrelenting flint to drops of rain
when did the tiger s young ones teach the dam
o do not learn her wrath she taught it thee the milk thou suck dst from her did turn to marble even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
yet every mother breeds not sons alike to chiron do thou entreat her show a woman s pity
what wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark
yet have i heard o could i find it now the lion mov d with pity did endure to have his princely paws par d all away
some say that ravens foster forlorn children the whilst their own birds famish in their nests o be to me though thy hard heart say no nothing so kind but something pitiful
i know not what it means away with her
for my father s sake that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee be not obdurate open thy deaf ears
hadst thou in person ne er offended me even for his sake am i pitiless
remember boys i pour d forth tears in vain to save your brother from the sacrifice but fierce andronicus would not relent
therefore away with her and use her as you will the worse to her the better lov d of me
o tamora be call d a gentle queen and with thine own hands kill me in this place
for tis not life that i have begg d so long poor i was slain when bassianus died
tis present death i beg and one thing more that womanhood denies my tongue to tell o keep me from their worse than killing lust and tumble me into some loathsome pit where never man s eye may behold my body do this and be a charitable murderer
so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee no let them satisfy their lust on thee
for thou hast stay d us here too long
ah beastly creature the blot and enemy to our general name
nay then i ll stop your mouth
this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him
demetrius throws the body of bassianus into the pit then exeunt demetrius and chiron dragging off lavinia tamora
farewell my sons see that you make her sure
ne er let my heart know merry cheer indeed till all the andronici be made away
now will i hence to seek my lovely moor and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower
exit re enter aaron with two of titus sons quintus and martius aaron
come on my lords the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep
my sight is very dull whate er it bodes
and mine i promise you were it not for shame well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile
what subtle hole is this whose mouth is covered with rude growing briers upon whose leaves are drops of new shed blood as fresh as morning dew distill d on flowers
a very fatal place it seems to me
speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
o brother with the dismal st object hurt that ever eye with sight made heart lament
aside now will i fetch the king to find them here that he thereby may have a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother
why dost not comfort me and help me out from this unhallow d and blood stained hole
i am surprised with an uncouth fear a chilling sweat o er runs my trembling joints my heart suspects more than mine eye can see
to prove thou hast a true divining heart aaron and thou look down into this den and see a fearful sight of blood and death
aaron is gone and my compassionate heart will not permit mine eyes once to behold the thing whereat it trembles by surmise o tell me who it is for ne er till now was i a child to fear i know not what
lord bassianus lies beray d in blood all on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb in this detested dark blood drinking pit
if it be dark how dost thou know tis he
upon his bloody finger he doth wear a precious ring that lightens all this hole which like a taper in some monument doth shine upon the dead man s earthy cheeks and shows the ragged entrails of this pit so pale did shine the moon on pyramus when he by night lay bath d in maiden blood
o brother help me with thy fainting hand if fear hath made thee faint as me it hath out of this fell devouring receptacle as hateful as cocytus misty mouth
reach me thy hand that i may help thee out or wanting strength to do thee so much good i may be pluck d into the swallowing womb of this deep pit poor bassianus grave
i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink
nor i no strength to climb without thy help
thy hand once more i will not loose again till thou art here aloft or i below
thou canst not come to me i come to thee
falls in enter the emperor and aaron the moor saturninus
i ll see what hole is here and what he is that now is leapt into it
say who art thou that lately didst descend into this gaping hollow of the earth
the unhappy sons of old andronicus brought hither in a most unlucky hour to find thy brother bassianus dead
i know thou dost but jest he and his lady both are at the lodge upon the north side of this pleasant chase tis not an hour since i left them there
we know not where you left them all alive but out alas
here have we found him dead
re enter tamora with attendants titus andronicus and lucius tamora
where is my lord the king
here tamora though griev d with killing grief
now to the bottom dost thou search my wound poor bassianus here lies murdered
then all too late i bring this fatal writ the complot of this timeless tragedy and wonder greatly that man s face can fold in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
she giveth saturnine a letter saturninus
reads an if we miss to meet him handsomely sweet huntsman bassianus tis we mean do thou so much as dig the grave for him
look for thy reward among the nettles at the elder tree which overshades the mouth of that same pit where we decreed to bury bassianus
do this and purchase us thy lasting friends
this is the pit and this the elder tree
look sirs if you can find the huntsman out that should have murdered bassianus here
my gracious lord here is the bag of gold
to titus two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody kind have here bereft my brother of his life
sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison there let them bide until we have devis d some never heard of torturing pain for them
what are they in this pit
high emperor upon my feeble knee i beg this boon with tears not lightly shed that this fell fault of my accursed sons accursed if the fault be prov d in them saturninus
andronicus himself did take it up
i did my lord yet let me be their bail for by my fathers reverend tomb i vow they shall be ready at your highness will to answer their suspicion with their lives
thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
some bring the murdered body some the murderers let them not speak a word the guilt is plain for by my soul were there worse end than death that end upon them should be executed
andronicus i will entreat the king
fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
come lucius come stay not to talk with them
another part of the forest enter the empress sons demetrius and chiron with lavinia her hands cut off and her tongue cut out and ravish d demetrius
so now go tell an if thy tongue can speak who twas that cut thy tongue and ravish d thee
write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe
see how with signs and tokens she can scrowl
go home call for sweet water wash thy hands
she hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash and so let s leave her to her silent walks
an twere my cause i should go hang myself
if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
exeunt demetrius and chiron wind horns
who is this my niece that flies away so fast
cousin a word where is your husband
if i do dream would all my wealth would wake me
if i do wake some planet strike me down that i may slumber an eternal sleep
what stern ungentle hands hath lopp d and hew d and made thy body bare of her two branches those sweet ornaments whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in and might not gain so great a happiness as half thy love
why dost not speak to me
alas a crimson river of warm blood like to a bubbling fountain stirr d with wind doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips coming and going with thy honey breath
but sure some tereus hath deflowered thee and lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
ah now thou turn st away thy face for shame
and notwithstanding all this loss of blood as from a conduit with three issuing spouts yet do thy cheeks look red as titan s face blushing to be encount red with a cloud
o that i knew thy heart and knew the beast that i might rail at him to ease my mind
sorrow concealed like an oven stopp d doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
fair philomel why she but lost her tongue and in a tedious sampler sew d her mind but lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
a craftier tereus cousin hast thou met and he hath cut those pretty fingers off that could have better sew d than philomel
o had the monster seen those lily hands tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute and make the silken strings delight to kiss them he would not then have touch d them for his life
or had he heard the heavenly harmony which that sweet tongue hath made he would have dropp d his knife and fell asleep as cerberus at the thracian poet s feet
come let us go and make thy father blind for such a sight will blind a father s eye one hour s storm will drown the fragrant meads what will whole months of tears thy father s eyes
do not draw back for we will mourn with thee o could our mourning case thy misery
a street enter the judges tribunes and senators with titus two sons martius and quintus bound passing on the stage to the place of execution and titus going before pleading titus
hear me grave fathers noble tribunes stay
for pity of mine age whose youth was spent in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept for all my blood in rome s great quarrel shed for all the frosty nights that i have watch d and for these bitter tears which now you see filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks be pitiful to my condemned sons whose souls are not corrupted as tis thought
for two and twenty sons i never wept because they died in honour s lofty bed
andronicus lieth down and the judges pass by him with the prisoners and exeunt for these tribunes in the dust i write my heart s deep languor and my soul s sad tears
let my tears stanch the earth s dry appetite my sons sweet blood will make it shame and blush
o earth i will befriend thee more with rain that shall distil from these two ancient urns than youthful april shall with all his show rs
in summer s drought i ll drop upon thee still in winter with warm tears i ll melt the snow and keep eternal spring time on thy face so thou refuse to drink my dear sons blood
enter lucius with his weapon drawn o reverend tribunes
unbind my sons reverse the doom of death and let me say that never wept before my tears are now prevailing orators
o noble father you lament in vain the tribunes hear you not no man is by and you recount your sorrows to a stone
ah lucius for thy brothers let me plead
grave tribunes once more i entreat of you
my gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
why tis no matter man if they did hear they would not mark me if they did mark they would not pity me yet plead i must and bootless unto them
therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones who though they cannot answer my distress yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes for that they will not intercept my tale
when i do weep they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me and were they but attired in grave weeds rome could afford no tribunes like to these
a stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones
a stone is silent and offendeth not and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
rises but wherefore stand st thou with thy weapon drawn
to rescue my two brothers from their death for which attempt the judges have pronounc d my everlasting doom of banishment
why foolish lucius dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers
tigers must prey and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou then from these devourers to be banished
but who comes with our brother marcus here
titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep or if not so thy noble heart to break
i bring consuming sorrow to thine age
faint hearted boy arise and look upon her
speak lavinia what accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy father s sight
what fool hath added water to the sea or brought a fagot to bright burning troy
my grief was at the height before thou cam st and now like nilus it disdaineth bounds
give me a sword i ll chop off my hands too for they have fought for rome and all in vain and they have nurs d this woe in feeding life in bootless prayer have they been held up and they have serv d me to effectless use
now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other
tis well lavinia that thou hast no hands for hands to do rome service is but vain
speak gentle sister who hath martyr d thee
o that delightful engine of her thoughts that blabb d them with such pleasing eloquence is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage where like a sweet melodious bird it sung sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
o say thou for her who hath done this deed
o thus i found her straying in the park seeking to hide herself as doth the deer that hath receiv d some unrecuring wound
it was my dear and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he kill d me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environ d with a wilderness of sea who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him
this way to death my wretched sons are gone here stands my other son a banish d man and here my brother weeping at my woes
but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn is dear lavinia dearer than my soul
had i but seen thy picture in this plight it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so
thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr d thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemn d and dead by this
ah son lucius look on her
when i did name her brothers then fresh tears stood on her cheeks as doth the honey dew upon a gath red lily almost withered
perchance she weeps because they kill d her husband perchance because she knows them innocent
if they did kill thy husband then be joyful because the law hath ta en revenge on them
no no they would not do so foul a deed witness the sorrow that their sister makes
gentle lavinia let me kiss thy lips or make some sign how i may do thee ease
shall thy good uncle and thy brother lucius and thou and i sit round about some fountain looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stain d like meadows yet not dry with miry slime left on them by a flood
and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness and made a brine pit with our bitter tears
or shall we cut away our hands like thine
or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days
let us that have our tongues plot some device of further misery to make us wonder d at in time to come
sweet father cease your tears for at your grief see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
brother well i wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine for thou poor man hast drown d it with thine own
ah my lavinia i will wipe thy cheeks
had she a tongue to speak now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin with his true tears all bewet can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
o what a sympathy of woe is this as far from help as limbo is from bliss
titus andronicus my lord the emperor sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons let marcus lucius or thyself old titus or any one of you chop off your hand and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive and that shall be the ransom for their fault
did ever raven sing so like a lark that gives sweet tidings of the sun s uprise
with all my heart i ll send the emperor my hand
good aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
for that noble hand of thine that hath thrown down so many enemies shall not be sent
my hand will serve the turn my youth can better spare my blood than you and therefore mine shall save my brothers lives
which of your hands hath not defended rome and rear d aloft the bloody battle axe writing destruction on the enemy s castle
o none of both but are of high desert
my hand hath been but idle let it serve to ransom my two nephews from their death then have i kept it to a worthy end
nay come agree whose hand shall go along for fear they die before their pardon come
by heaven it shall not go
sirs strive no more such with red herbs as these are meet for plucking up and therefore mine
sweet father if i shall be thought thy son let me redeem my brothers both from death
and for our father s sake and mother s care now let me show a brother s love to thee
agree between you i will spare my hand
then i ll go fetch an axe
but i will use the axe
come hither aaron i ll deceive them both lend me thy hand and i will give thee mine
aside if that be call d deceit i will be honest and never whilst i live deceive men so but i ll deceive you in another sort and that you ll say ere half an hour pass
he cuts off titus hand re enter lucius and marcus titus
what shall be is dispatch d
good aaron give his majesty my hand tell him it was a hand that warded him from thousand dangers bid him bury it
more hath it merited that let it have
as for my sons say i account of them as jewels purchas d at an easy price and yet dear too because i bought mine own
i go andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee
o how this villainy doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
let fools do good and fair men call for grace aaron will have his soul black like his face
o here i lift this one hand up to heaven and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears to that i call
to lavinia what would st thou kneel with me
do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers or with our sighs we ll breathe the welkin dim and stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms
o brother speak with possibility and do not break into these deep extremes
is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
then be my passions bottomless with them
but yet let reason govern thy lament
if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes
when heaven doth weep doth not the earth o erflow
if the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad threat ning the welkin with his big swol n face
and wilt thou have a reason for this coil
i am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
she is the weeping welkin i the earth then must my sea be moved with her sighs then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge overflow d and drown d for why my bowels cannot hide her woes but like a drunkard must i vomit them
then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues
enter a messenger with two heads and a hand messenger
worthy andronicus ill art thou repaid for that good hand thou sent st the emperor
here are the heads of thy two noble sons and here s thy hand in scorn to thee sent back thy grief their sports thy resolution mock d that woe is me to think upon thy woes more than remembrance of my father s death
now let hot aetna cool in sicily and be my heart an ever burning hell
these miseries are more than may be borne
to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal but sorrow flouted at is double death
ah that this sight should make so deep a wound and yet detested life not shrink thereat
that ever death should let life bear his name where life hath no more interest but to breathe
alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless as frozen water to a starved snake
when will this fearful slumber have an end
now farewell flatt ry die andronicus
thou dost not slumber see thy two sons heads thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here thy other banish d son with this dear sight struck pale and bloodless and thy brother i even like a stony image cold and numb
now no more will i control thy griefs
rent off thy silver hair thy other hand gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight the closing up of our most wretched eyes
now is a time to storm why art thou still
it fits not with this hour
why i have not another tear to shed besides this sorrow is an enemy and would usurp upon my wat ry eyes and make them blind with tributary tears
then which way shall i find revenge s cave
for these two heads do seem to speak to me and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be return d again even in their throats that have committed them
come let me see what task i have to do
you heavy people circle me about that i may turn me to each one of you and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
come brother take a head and in this hand the other will i bear
and lavinia thou shalt be employ d in this bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
as for thee boy go get thee from my sight thou art an exile and thou must not stay
hie to the goths and raise an army there and if ye love me as i think you do let s kiss and part for we have much to do
farewell andronicus my noble father the woefull st man that ever liv d in rome
farewell proud rome till lucius come again he leaves his pledges dearer than his life
farewell lavinia my noble sister o would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives but in oblivion and hateful griefs
if lucius live he will requite your wrongs and make proud saturnine and his emperess beg at the gates like tarquin and his queen
now will i to the goths and raise a pow r to be reveng d on rome and saturnine
enter titus marcus lavinia and the boy young lucius titus
so so now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours
marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot thy niece and i poor creatures want our hands and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms
this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast who when my heart all mad with misery beats in this hollow prison of my flesh then thus i thump it down
to lavinia thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs
when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans or get some little knife between thy teeth and just against thy heart make thou a hole that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears
teach her not thus to lay such violent hands upon her tender life
has sorrow made thee dote already
why marcus no man should be mad but i
what violent hands can she lay on her life
ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o er how troy was burnt and he made miserable
o handle not the theme to talk of hands lest we remember still that we have none
fie fie how franticly i square my talk as if we should forget we had no hands if marcus did not name the word of hands
come let s fall to and gentle girl eat this here is no drink
hark marcus what she says i can interpret all her martyr d signs she says she drinks no other drink but tears brew d with her sorrow mesh d upon her cheeks
speechless complainer i will learn thy thought in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers
thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practice learn to know thy meaning
good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
alas the tender boy in passion mov d doth weep to see his grandsire s heaviness
peace tender sapling thou art made of tears and tears will quickly melt thy life away
marcus strikes the dish with a knife what dost thou strike at marcus with thy knife
at that that i have kill d my lord a fly
out on thee murderer thou kill st my heart
mine eyes are cloy d with view of tyranny a deed of death done on the innocent becomes not titus brother
get thee gone i see thou art not for my company
alas my lord i have but kill d a fly
how if that fly had a father and mother
how would he hang his slender gilded wings and buzz lamenting doings in the air
poor harmless fly that with his pretty buzzing melody came here to make us merry
and thou hast kill d him
pardon me sir it was a black ill favour d fly like to the empress moor therefore i kill d him
then pardon me for reprehending thee for thou hast done a charitable deed
give me thy knife i will insult on him flattering myself as if it were the moor come hither purposely to poison me
there s for thyself and that s for tamora
yet i think we are not brought so low but that between us we can kill a fly that comes in likeness of a coal black moor
grief has so wrought on him he takes false shadows for true substances
lavinia go with me i ll to thy closet and go read with thee sad stories chanced in the times of old
come boy and go with me thy sight is young and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle
titus garden enter young lucius and lavinia running after him and the boy flies from her with his books under his arm
my aunt lavinia follows me everywhere i know not why
good uncle marcus see how swift she comes
alas sweet aunt i know not what you mean
stand by me lucius do not fear thine aunt
she loves thee boy too well to do thee harm
ay when my father was in rome she did
what means my niece lavinia by these signs
fear her not lucius somewhat doth she mean
see lucius see how much she makes of thee
somewhither would she have thee go with her
ah boy cornelia never with more care read to her sons than she hath read to thee sweet poetry and tully s orator
canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus
my lord i know not i nor can i guess unless some fit or frenzy do possess her for i have heard my grandsire say full oft extremity of griefs would make men mad and i have read that hecuba of troy ran mad for sorrow
that made me to fear although my lord i know my noble aunt loves me as dear as e er my mother did and would not but in fury fright my youth which made me down to throw my books and fly causeless perhaps
but pardon me sweet aunt and madam if my uncle marcus go i will most willingly attend your ladyship
lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which lucius has let fall titus
some book there is that she desires to see
which is it girl of these open them boy but thou art deeper read and better skill d come and take choice of all my library and so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens reveal the damn d contriver of this deed
why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
i think she means that there were more than one confederate in the fact ay more there was or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
lucius what book is that she tosseth so
grandsire tis ovid s metamorphoses my mother gave it me
for love of her that s gone perhaps she cull d it from among the rest
so busily she turns the leaves
this is the tragic tale of philomel and treats of tereus treason and his rape and rape i fear was root of thy annoy
note how she quotes the leaves
lavinia wert thou thus surpris d sweet girl ravish d and wrong d as philomela was forc d in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods
ay such a place there is where we did hunt o had we never never hunted there pattern d by that the poet here describes by nature made for murders and for rapes
o why should nature build so foul a den unless the gods delight in tragedies
give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends what roman lord it was durst do the deed
or slunk not saturnine as tarquin erst that left the camp to sin in lucrece bed
sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me

she takes the staff in her mouth and guides it with stumps and writes o do ye read my lord what she hath writ
the lustful sons of tamora performers of this heinous bloody deed
magni dominator poli tam lentus audis scelera
although i know there is enough written upon this earth to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts and arm the minds of infants to exclaims

the angry northern wind will blow these sands like sibyl s leaves abroad and where s our lesson then

exeunt titus lavinia and young lucius marcus
o heavens can you hear a good man groan and not relent or not compassion him
marcus attend him in his ecstasy that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart than foemen s marks upon his batt red shield but yet so just that he will not revenge
revenge the heavens for old andronicus
the palace enter aaron demetrius and chiron at one door and at the other door young lucius and another with a bundle of weapons and verses writ upon them chiron
demetrius here s the son of lucius he hath some message to deliver us
ay some mad message from his mad grandfather
my lords with all the humbleness i may i greet your honours from andronicus aside and pray the roman gods confound you both
aside that you are both decipher d that s the news for villains mark d with rape may it please you my grandsire well advis d hath sent by me the goodliest weapons of his armoury to gratify your honourable youth the hope of rome for so he bid me say and so i do and with his gifts present your lordships that whenever you have need you may be armed and appointed well
and so i leave you both aside like bloody villains
exeunt young lucius and attendant demetrius
a scroll and written round about
let s see reads integer vitae scelerisque purus non eget mauri iaculis nec arcu
o tis a verse in horace i know it well i read it in the grammar long ago
ay just a verse in horace
aside now what a thing it is to be an ass
the old man hath found their guilt and sends them weapons wrapp d about with lines that wound beyond their feeling to the quick
but were our witty empress well afoot she would applaud andronicus conceit
but let her rest in her unrest awhile and now young lords was t not a happy star led us to rome strangers and more than so captives to be advanced to this height
it did me good before the palace gate to brave the tribune in his brother s hearing
but me more good to see so great a lord basely insinuate and send us gifts
had he not reason lord demetrius
did you not use his daughter very friendly
i would we had a thousand roman dames at such a bay by turn to serve our lust
a charitable wish and full of love
here lacks but your mother for to say amen
and that would she for twenty thousand more
come let us go and pray to all the gods for our beloved mother in her pains
aside pray to the devils the gods have given us over
why do the emperor s trumpets flourish thus
belike for joy the emperor hath a son
enter nurse with a blackamoor child nurse
o tell me did you see aaron the moor

why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
what dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms
o that which i would hide from heaven s eye our empress shame and stately rome s disgrace
she is delivered lord she is delivered
i mean she is brought a bed
well god give her good rest
why then she is the devil s dam a joyful issue
a joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
here is the babe as loathsome as a toad amongst the fair fac d breeders of our clime the empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal and bids thee christen it with thy dagger s point
is black so base a hue
sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure
that which thou canst not undo
villain i have done thy mother
and therein hellish dog thou hast undone her
woe to her chance and damn d her loathed choice

i ll broach the tadpole on my rapier s point
nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it
sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up
takes the child from the nurse and draws stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
now by the burning tapers of the sky that shone so brightly when this boy was got he dies upon my scimitar s sharp point that touches this my first born son and heir
i tell you younglings not enceladus with all his threat ning band of typhon s brood nor great alcides nor the god of war shall seize this prey out of his father s hands
what what ye sanguine shallow hearted boys
coal black is better than another hue in that it scorns to bear another hue for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan s black legs to white although she lave them hourly in the flood
tell the empress from me i am of age to keep mine own excuse it how she can
wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus
my mistress is my mistress this my self the vigour and the picture of my youth
this before all the world do i prefer this maugre all the world will i keep safe or some of you shall smoke for it in rome
by this our mother is for ever sham d
rome will despise her for this foul escape
the emperor in his rage will doom her death
i blush to think upon this ignomy
why there s the privilege your beauty bears fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing the close enacts and counsels of thy heart
here s a young lad fram d of another leer
look how the black slave smiles upon the father as who should say old lad i am thine own
he is your brother lords sensibly fed of that self blood that first gave life to you and from your womb where you imprisoned were he is enfranchised and come to light
nay he is your brother by the surer side although my seal be stamped in his face
aaron what shall i say unto the empress
advise thee aaron what is to be done and we will all subscribe to thy advice
save thou the child so we may all be safe
then sit we down and let us all consult
my son and i will have the wind of you keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety
how many women saw this child of his
when we join in league i am a lamb but if you brave the moor the chafed boar the mountain lioness the ocean swells not so as aaron storms
but say again how many saw the child
cornelia the midwife and myself and no one else but the delivered empress
the emperess the midwife and yourself
two may keep counsel when the third s away go to the empress tell her this i said
so cries a pig prepared to the spit
o lord sir tis a deed of policy
shall she live to betray this guilt of ours a long tongu d babbling gossip
and now be it known to you my full intent not far one muliteus my countryman his wife but yesternight was brought to bed his child is like to her fair as you are
go pack with him and give the mother gold and tell them both the circumstance of all and how by this their child shall be advanc d and be received for the emperor s heir and substituted in the place of mine to calm this tempest whirling in the court and let the emperor dandle him for his own
you see i have given her physic pointing to the nurse and you must needs bestow her funeral the fields are near and you are gallant grooms
this done see that you take no longer days but send the midwife presently to me
the midwife and the nurse well made away then let the ladies tattle what they please
aaron i see thou wilt not trust the air with secrets
for this care of tamora herself and hers are highly bound to thee
exeunt demetrius and chiron bearing off the dead nurse aaron
now to the goths as swift as swallow flies there to dispose this treasure in mine arms and secretly to greet the empress friends
come on you thick lipp d slave i ll bear you hence for it is you that puts us to our shifts
i ll make you feed on berries and on roots and feed on curds and whey and suck the goat and cabin in a cave and bring you up to be a warrior and command a camp
exit with the child scene iii
a public place enter titus bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them with him marcus young lucius and other gentlemen publius sempronius and caius with bows titus
come marcus come kinsmen this is the way
sir boy let me see your archery look ye draw home enough and tis there straight
terras astrea reliquit be you rememb red marcus she s gone she s fled
sirs take you to your tools
you cousins shall go sound the ocean and cast your nets happily you may catch her in the sea yet there s as little justice as at land
no publius and sempronius you must do it tis you must dig with mattock and with spade and pierce the inmost centre of the earth then when you come to pluto s region i pray you deliver him this petition
tell him it is for justice and for aid and that it comes from old andronicus shaken with sorrows in ungrateful rome
well well i made thee miserable what time i threw the people s suffrages on him that thus doth tyrannize o er me
go get you gone and pray be careful all and leave you not a man of war unsearch d
this wicked emperor may have shipp d her hence and kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice
o publius is not this a heavy case to see thy noble uncle thus distract
therefore my lords it highly us concerns by day and night t attend him carefully and feed his humour kindly as we may till time beget some careful remedy
kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
join with the goths and with revengeful war take wreak on rome for this ingratitude and vengeance on the traitor saturnine
what have you met with her
no my good lord but pluto sends you word if you will have revenge from hell you shall
marry for justice she is so employ d he thinks with jove in heaven or somewhere else so that perforce you must needs stay a time
he doth me wrong to feed me with delays
i ll dive into the burning lake below and pull her out of acheron by the heels
marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we no big bon d men fram d of the cyclops size but metal marcus steel to the very back yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear and sith there s no justice in earth nor hell we will solicit heaven and move the gods to send down justice for to wreak our wrongs
you are a good archer marcus
he gives them the arrows ad jovem that s for you here ad apollinem
ad martem that s for myself
here boy to pallas here to mercury
to saturn caius not to saturnine you were as good to shoot against the wind
of my word i have written to effect there s not a god left unsolicited
kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court we will afflict the emperor in his pride
they shoot o well said lucius
good boy in virgo s lap
my lord i aim a mile beyond the moon your letter is with jupiter by this
see see thou hast shot off one of taurus horns
this was the sport my lord when publius shot the bull being gall d gave aries such a knock that down fell both the ram s horns in the court and who should find them but the empress villain
she laugh d and told the moor he should not choose but give them to his master for a present
enter the clown with a basket and two pigeons in it news news from heaven
he says that he hath taken them down again for the man must not be hang d till the next week
but what says jupiter i ask thee
alas sir i know not jupiter i never drank with him in all my life
why villain art not thou the carrier
ay of my pigeons sir nothing else
why didst thou not come from heaven
alas sir i never came there
god forbid i should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days
why i am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperal s men
why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you
tell me can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace
nay truly sir i could never say grace in all my life
make no more ado but give your pigeons to the emperor by me thou shalt have justice at his hands
meanwhile here s money for thy charges
sirrah can you with a grace deliver up a supplication
then here is a supplication for you
and when you come to him at the first approach you must kneel then kiss his foot then deliver up your pigeons and then look for your reward
i ll be at hand sir see you do it bravely
i warrant you sir let me alone
here marcus fold it in the oration for thou hast made it like a humble suppliant
and when thou hast given it to the emperor knock at my door and tell me what he says
god be with you sir i will
before the palace enter the emperor and the empress and her two sons demetrius and chiron lords and others
the emperor brings the arrows in his hand that titus shot at him saturninus
why lords what wrongs are these
was ever seen an emperor in rome thus overborne troubled confronted thus and for the extent of egal justice us d in such contempt
my lords you know as know the mightful gods however these disturbers of our peace buzz in the people s ears there nought hath pass d but even with law against the wilful sons of old andronicus
and what an if his sorrows have so overwhelm d his wits shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks his fits his frenzy and his bitterness
and now he writes to heaven for his redress
see here s to jove and this to mercury this to apollo this to the god of war sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome
what s this but libelling against the senate and blazoning our unjustice every where
a goodly humour is it not my lords
as who would say in rome no justice were
but if i live his feigned ecstasies shall be no shelter to these outrages but he and his shall know that justice lives in saturninus health whom if she sleep he ll so awake as he in fury shall cut off the proud st conspirator that lives
my gracious lord my lovely saturnine lord of my life commander of my thoughts calm thee and bear the faults of titus age th effects of sorrow for his valiant sons whose loss hath pierc d him deep and scarr d his heart and rather comfort his distressed plight than prosecute the meanest or the best for these contempts
aside why thus it shall become high witted tamora to gloze with all
but titus i have touch d thee to the quick thy life blood out if aaron now be wise then is all safe the anchor in the port
enter clown how now good fellow
yes forsooth an your mistriship be emperial
empress i am but yonder sits the emperor
tis he god and saint stephen give you godden
i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here
go take him away and hang him presently
how much money must i have
come sirrah you must be hang d
by r lady then i have brought up a neck to a fair end
shall i endure this monstrous villainy
i know from whence this same device proceeds
may this be borne as if his traitorous sons that died by law for murder of our brother have by my means been butchered wrongfully
go drag the villain hither by the hair nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
for this proud mock i ll be thy slaughterman sly frantic wretch that holp st to make me great in hope thyself should govern rome and me
enter nuntius aemilius what news with thee aemilius
the goths have gathered head and with a power of high resolved men bent to the spoil they hither march amain under conduct of lucius son to old andronicus who threats in course of this revenge to do as much as ever coriolanus did
is warlike lucius general of the goths
these tidings nip me and i hang the head as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
ay now begins our sorrows to approach
tis he the common people love so much myself hath often heard them say when i have walked like a private man that lucius banishment was wrongfully and they have wish d that lucius were their emperor
ay but the citizens favour lucius and will revolt from me to succour him
king be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
is the sun dimm d that gnats do fly in it
the eagle suffers little birds to sing and is not careful what they mean thereby knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so mayest thou the giddy men of rome
then cheer thy spirit for know thou emperor i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet and yet more dangerous than baits to fish or honey stalks to sheep when as the one is wounded with the bait the other rotted with delicious feed
but he will not entreat his son for us
if tamora entreat him then he will for i can smooth and fill his aged ears with golden promises that were his heart almost impregnable his old ears deaf yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
to aemilius go thou before to be our ambassador say that the emperor requests a parley of warlike lucius and appoint the meeting even at his father s house the old andronicus
aemilius do this message honourably and if he stand on hostage for his safety bid him demand what pledge will please him best
your bidding shall i do effectually
now will i to that old andronicus and temper him with all the art i have to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths
and now sweet emperor be blithe again and bury all thy fear in my devices
then go successantly and plead to him
exeunt act v scene i plains near rome enter lucius with an army of goths with drums and colours lucius
approved warriors and my faithful friends i have received letters from great rome which signifies what hate they bear their emperor and how desirous of our sight they are
therefore great lords be as your titles witness imperious and impatient of your wrongs and wherein rome hath done you any scath let him make treble satisfaction
brave slip sprung from the great andronicus whose name was once our terror now our comfort whose high exploits and honourable deeds ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt be bold in us we ll follow where thou lead st like stinging bees in hottest summer s day led by their master to the flow red fields and be aveng d on cursed tamora
and as he saith so say we all with him
i humbly thank him and i thank you all
but who comes here led by a lusty goth
enter a goth leading aaron with his child in his arms second goth
renowned lucius from our troops i stray d to gaze upon a ruinous monastery and as i earnestly did fix mine eye upon the wasted building suddenly i heard a child cry underneath a wall
i made unto the noise when soon i heard the crying babe controll d with this discourse peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam
did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art had nature lent thee but thy mother s look villain thou mightst have been an emperor but where the bull and cow are both milk white they never do beget a coal black calf
even thus he rates the babe for i must bear thee to a trusty goth who when he knows thou art the empress babe will hold thee dearly for thy mother s sake
with this my weapon drawn i rush d upon him surpris d him suddenly and brought him hither to use as you think needful of the man
o worthy goth this is the incarnate devil that robb d andronicus of his good hand this is the pearl that pleas d your empress eye and here s the base fruit of her burning lust
say wall ey d slave whither wouldst thou convey this growing image of thy fiend like face
hang him on this tree and by his side his fruit of bastardy
touch not the boy he is of royal blood
too like the sire for ever being good
first hang the child that he may see it sprawl a sight to vex the father s soul withal
a ladder brought which aaron is made to climb aaron
lucius save the child and bear it from me to the emperess
if thou do this i ll show thee wondrous things that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not befall what may befall i ll speak no more but vengeance rot you all
say on an if it please me which thou speak st thy child shall live and i will see it nourish d
why assure thee lucius twill vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak for i must talk of murders rapes and massacres acts of black night abominable deeds complots of mischief treason villainies ruthful to hear yet piteously perform d and this shall all be buried in my death unless thou swear to me my child shall live
tell on thy mind i say thy child shall live
swear that he shall and then i will begin
thou believest no god that granted how canst thou believe an oath
as indeed i do not yet for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee called conscience with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies which i have seen thee careful to observe therefore i urge thy oath
for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears to that i ll urge him
therefore thou shalt vow by that same god what god soe er it be that thou adorest and hast in reverence to save my boy to nourish and bring him up or else i will discover nought to thee
even by my god i swear to thee i will
first know thou i begot him on the empress
o most insatiate and luxurious woman
tut lucius this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon
twas her two sons that murdered bassianus they cut thy sister s tongue and ravish d her and cut her hands and trimm d her as thou sawest
why she was wash d and cut and trimm d and twas trim sport for them which had the doing of it
o barbarous beastly villains like thyself
indeed i was their tutor to instruct them
that codding spirit had they from their mother as sure a card as ever won the set that bloody mind i think they learn d of me as true a dog as ever fought at head
well let my deeds be witness of my worth
i train d thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within that letter mention d confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done that thou hast cause to rue wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it
i play d the cheater for thy father s hand and when i had it drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
i pried me through the crevice of a wall when for his hand he had his two sons heads beheld his tears and laugh d so heartily that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport she swooned almost at my pleasing tale and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
what canst thou say all this and never blush
ay like a black dog as the saying is
art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
ay that i had not done a thousand more
even now i curse the day and yet i think few come within the compass of my curse wherein i did not some notorious ill as kill a man or else devise his death ravish a maid or plot the way to do it accuse some innocent and forswear myself set deadly enmity between two friends make poor men s cattle break their necks set fire on barns and hay stacks in the night and bid the owners quench them with their tears
oft have i digg d up dead men from their graves and set them upright at their dear friends door even when their sorrows almost was forgot and on their skins as on the bark of trees have with my knife carved in roman letters let not your sorrow die though i am dead
tut i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i cannot do ten thousand more
bring down the devil for he must not die so sweet a death as hanging presently
if there be devils would i were a devil to live and burn in everlasting fire so i might have your company in hell but to torment you with my bitter tongue
sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more
my lord there is a messenger from rome desires to be admitted to your presence
what s the news from rome
lord lucius and you princes of the goths the roman emperor greets you all by me and for he understands you are in arms he craves a parley at your father s house willing you to demand your hostages and they shall be immediately deliver d
aemilius let the emperor give his pledges unto my father and my uncle marcus
before titus house enter tamora and her two sons demetrius and chiron disguised tamora
thus in this strange and sad habiliment i will encounter with andronicus and say i am revenge sent from below to join with him and right his heinous wrongs
knock at his study where they say he keeps to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge tell him revenge is come to join with him and work confusion on his enemies
they knock and titus opens his study door above titus
is it your trick to make me ope the door that so my sad decrees may fly away and all my study be to no effect
you are deceiv d for what i mean to do see here in bloody lines i have set down and what is written shall be executed
titus i am come to talk with thee
how can i grace my talk wanting a hand to give it that accord
thou hast the odds of me therefore no more
if thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me
i am not mad i know thee well enough witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines witness these trenches made by grief and care witness the tiring day and heavy night witness all sorrow that i know thee well for our proud empress mighty tamora
is not thy coming for my other hand
know thou sad man i am not tamora she is thy enemy and i thy friend
i am revenge sent from th infernal kingdom to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
come down and welcome me to this world s light confer with me of murder and of death there s not a hollow cave or lurking place no vast obscurity or misty vale where bloody murder or detested rape can couch for fear but i will find them out and in their ears tell them my dreadful name revenge which makes the foul offender quake
and art thou sent to me to be a torment to mine enemies
i am therefore come down and welcome me
do me some service ere i come to thee
lo by thy side where rape and murder stands now give some surance that thou art revenge stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels and then i ll come and be thy waggoner and whirl along with thee about the globes
provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away and find out murderers in their guilty caves and when thy car is loaden with their heads i will dismount and by thy waggon wheel trot like a servile footman all day long even from hyperion s rising in the east until his very downfall in the sea
and day by day i ll do this heavy task so thou destroy rapine and murder there
these are my ministers and come with me
rape and murder therefore called so cause they take vengeance of such kind of men
good lord how like the empress sons they are
but we worldly men have miserable mad mistaking eyes
o sweet revenge now do i come to thee and if one arm s embracement will content thee i will embrace thee in it by and by
this closing with him fits his lunacy
whate er i forge to feed his brain sick humours do you uphold and maintain in your speeches for now he firmly takes me for revenge and being credulous in this mad thought i ll make him send for lucius his son and whilst i at a banquet hold him sure i ll find some cunning practice out of hand to scatter and disperse the giddy goths or at the least make them his enemies
see here he comes and i must ply my theme
long have i been forlorn and all for thee
welcome dread fury to my woeful house
rapine and murder you are welcome too
how like the empress and her sons you are
well are you fitted had you but a moor
could not all hell afford you such a devil
for well i wot the empress never wags but in her company there is a moor and would you represent our queen aright it were convenient you had such a devil
what wouldst thou have us do andronicus
show me a murderer i ll deal with him
show me a villain that hath done a rape and i am sent to be reveng d on him
show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong and i will be revenged on them all
look round about the wicked streets of rome and when thou find st a man that s like thyself good murder stab him he s a murderer
go thou with him and when it is thy hap to find another that is like to thee good rapine stab him he is a ravisher
go thou with them and in the emperor s court there is a queen attended by a moor well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion for up and down she doth resemble thee
i pray thee do on them some violent death they have been violent to me and mine
well hast thou lesson d us this shall we do
but would it please thee good andronicus to send for lucius thy thrice valiant son who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths and bid him come and banquet at thy house when he is here even at thy solemn feast i will bring in the empress and her sons the emperor himself and all thy foes and at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
what says andronicus to this device
enter marcus go gentle marcus to thy nephew lucius thou shalt inquire him out among the goths
bid him repair to me and bring with him some of the chiefest princes of the goths bid him encamp his soldiers where they are
tell him the emperor and the empress too feast at my house and he shall feast with them
this do thou for my love and so let him as he regards his aged father s life
this will i do and soon return again
now will i hence about thy business and take my ministers along with me
nay nay let rape and murder stay with me or else i ll call my brother back again and cleave to no revenge but lucius
aside to her sons what say you boys
will you abide with him whiles i go tell my lord the emperor how i have govern d our determin d jest
yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair and tarry with him till i turn again
aside i knew them all though they suppos d me mad and will o er reach them in their own devices a pair of cursed hell hounds and their dam
madam depart at pleasure leave us here
farewell andronicus revenge now goes to lay a complot to betray thy foes
i know thou dost and sweet revenge farewell

tut i have work enough for you to do
publius come hither caius and valentine
enter publius caius and valentine publius
the empress sons i take them chiron demetrius
thou art too much deceiv d
the one is murder and rape is the other s name and therefore bind them gentle publius caius and valentine lay hands on them
oft have you heard me wish for such an hour and now i find it therefore bind them sure and stop their mouths if they begin to cry
exit they lay hold on chiron and demetrius chiron
and therefore do we what we are commanded
stop close their mouths let them not speak a word
look that you bind them fast
re enter titus andronicus with a knife and lavinia with a basin titus
come come lavinia look thy foes are bound
sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me but let them hear what fearful words i utter
here stands the spring whom you have stain d with mud this goodly summer with your winter mix d
you kill d her husband and for that vile fault two of her brothers were condemn d to death my hand cut off and made a merry jest both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear than hands or tongue her spotless chastity inhuman traitors you constrain d and forc d
what would you say if i should let you speak
villains for shame you could not beg for grace
how i mean to martyr you
this one hand yet is left to cut your throats whiles that lavinia tween her stumps doth hold the basin that receives your guilty blood
you know your mother means to feast with me and calls herself revenge and thinks me mad
i will grind your bones to dust and with your blood and it i ll make a paste and of the paste a coffin i will rear and make two pasties of your shameful heads and bid that strumpet your unhallowed dam like to the earth swallow her own increase
this is the feast that i have bid her to and this the banquet she shall surfeit on for worse than philomel you us d my daughter and worse than progne i will be reveng d
lavinia come receive the blood and when that they are dead let me go grind their bones to powder small and with this hateful liquor temper it and in that paste let their vile heads be bak d
come come be every one officious to make this banquet which i wish may prove more stern and bloody than the centaurs feast
now bring them in for i will play the cook and see them ready against their mother comes
exeunt bearing the dead bodies scene iii

uncle marcus since tis my father s mind that i repair to rome i am content
and ours with thine befall what fortune will
good uncle take you in this barbarous moor this ravenous tiger this accursed devil let him receive no sust nance fetter him till he be brought unto the empress face for testimony of her foul proceedings
and see the ambush of our friends be strong i fear the emperor means no good to us
some devil whisper curses in my ear and prompt me that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart
sirs help our uncle to convey him in
flourish within the trumpets show the emperor is at hand
enter saturninus and tamora with aemilius tribunes senators and others saturninus
what hath the firmament more suns than one
what boots it thee to can thyself a sun
rome s emperor and nephew break the parle these quarrels must be quietly debated
the feast is ready which the careful titus hath ordain d to an honourable end for peace for love for league and good to rome
please you therefore draw nigh and take your places
the company sit down trumpets sounding enter titus like a cook placing the dishes and lavinia with a veil over her face also young lucius and others titus
welcome my lord welcome dread queen welcome ye warlike goths welcome lucius and welcome all
although the cheer be poor twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it
why art thou thus attir d andronicus
because i would be sure to have all well to entertain your highness and your empress
we are beholding to you good andronicus
an if your highness knew my heart you were
my lord the emperor resolve me this was it well done of rash virginius to slay his daughter with his own right hand because she was enforc d stain d and deflower d
because the girl should not survive her shame and by her presence still renew his sorrows
a reason mighty strong and effectual a pattern precedent and lively warrant for me most wretched to perform the like
die die lavinia and thy shame with thee he kills her and with thy shame thy father s sorrow die
what hast thou done unnatural and unkind
kill d her for whom my tears have made me blind
i am as woeful as virginius was and have a thousand times more cause than he to do this outrage and it now is done
will t please your highness feed
why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus
not i twas chiron and demetrius
they ravish d her and cut away her tongue and they twas they that did her all this wrong
go fetch them hither to us presently
why there they are both baked in this pie whereof their mother daintily hath fed eating the flesh that she herself hath bred
tis true tis true witness my knife s sharp point
die frantic wretch for this accursed deed
can the son s eye behold his father bleed
there s meed for meed death for a deadly deed
lucius marcus and their friends go up into the balcony marcus
you sad fac d men people and sons of rome by uproars sever d as a flight of fowl scatter d by winds and high tempestuous gusts
o let me teach you how to knit again this scattered corn into one mutual sheaf these broken limbs again into one body lest rome herself be bane unto herself and she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to like a forlorn and desperate castaway do shameful execution on herself
but if my frosty signs and chaps of age grave witnesses of true experience cannot induce you to attend my words to lucius speak rome s dear friend as erst our ancestor when with his solemn tongue he did discourse to love sick dido s sad attending ear the story of that baleful burning night when subtle greeks surpris d king priam s troy
tell us what sinon hath bewitch d our ears or who hath brought the fatal engine in that gives our troy our rome the civil wound
my heart is not compact of flint nor steel nor can i utter all our bitter grief but floods of tears will drown my oratory and break my utt rance even in the time when it should move ye to attend me most and force you to commiseration
here s rome s young captain let him tell the tale while i stand by and weep to hear him speak
then gracious auditory be it known to you that chiron and the damn d demetrius were they that murd red our emperor s brother and they it were that ravished our sister
for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded our father s tears despis d and basely cozen d of that true hand that fought rome s quarrel out and sent her enemies unto the grave
lastly myself unkindly banished the gates shut on me and turn d weeping out to beg relief among rome s enemies who drown d their enmity in my true tears and op d their arms to embrace me as a friend
i am the turned forth be it known to you that have preserv d her welfare in my blood and from her bosom took the enemy s point sheathing the steel in my advent rous body
you know i am no vaunter i my scars can witness dumb although they are that my report is just and full of truth
methinks i do digress too much citing my worthless praise
for when no friends are by men praise themselves
now is my turn to speak
pointing to the child in an attendant s arms of this was tamora delivered the issue of an irreligious moor chief architect and plotter of these woes
the villain is alive in titus house damn d as he is to witness this is true
now judge what cause had titus to revenge these wrongs unspeakable past patience or more than any living man could bear
now have you heard the truth what say you romans
have we done aught amiss show us wherein and from the place where you behold us pleading the poor remainder of andronici will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves and on the ragged stones beat forth our souls and make a mutual closure of our house
speak romans speak and if you say we shall lo hand in hand lucius and i will fall
come come thou reverend man of rome and bring our emperor gently in thy hand lucius our emperor for well i know the common voice do cry it shall be so
lucius all hail rome s royal emperor
go go into old titus sorrowful house and hither hale that misbelieving moor to be adjudg d some direful slaught ring death as punishment for his most wicked life
lucius marcus and the others descend all
lucius all hail rome s gracious governor
may i govern so to heal rome s harms and wipe away her woe
but gentle people give me aim awhile for nature puts me to a heavy task
stand all aloof but uncle draw you near to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
o take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips
kisses titus these sorrowful drops upon thy blood stain d face the last true duties of thy noble son
tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips
o were the sum of these that i should pay countless and infinite yet would i pay them
come hither boy come come come and learn of us to melt in showers
thy grandsire lov d thee well many a time he danc d thee on his knee sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow many a story hath he told to thee and bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind and talk of them when he was dead and gone
how many thousand times hath these poor lips when they were living warm d themselves on thine
o now sweet boy give them their latest kiss
bid him farewell commit him to the grave do them that kindness and take leave of them
ev n with all my heart would i were dead so you did live again
o lord i cannot speak to him for weeping my tears will choke me if i ope my mouth
re enter attendants with aaron a roman
you sad andronici have done with woes give sentence on the execrable wretch that hath been breeder of these dire events
set him breast deep in earth and famish him there let him stand and rave and cry for food
if any one relieves or pities him for the offence he dies
some stay to see him fast ned in the earth
ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
i am no baby i that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform if i might have my will
if one good deed in all my life i did i do repent it from my very soul
some loving friends convey the emperor hence and give him burial in his father s grave
my father and lavinia shall forthwith be closed in our household s monument
as for that ravenous tiger tamora no funeral rite nor man in mourning weed no mournful bell shall ring her burial but throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey
her life was beastly and devoid of pity and being dead let birds on her take pity
exeunt the history of troilus and cressida contents act i prologue
the plain between troy and the grecian camp
scene v another part of the plain
from isles of greece the princes orgulous their high blood chaf’d have to the port of athens sent their ships fraught with the ministers and instruments of cruel war
sixty and nine that wore their crownets regal from the athenian bay put forth toward phrygia and their vow is made to ransack troy within whose strong immures the ravish’d helen menelaus’ queen with wanton paris sleeps—and that’s the quarrel
to tenedos they come and the deep drawing barks do there disgorge their war like fraughtage
now on dardan plains the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch their brave pavilions priam’s six gated city dardan and tymbria ilias chetas troien and antenorides with massy staples and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts stir up the sons of troy
now expectation tickling skittish spirits on one and other side trojan and greek sets all on hazard
and hither am i come a prologue arm’d but not in confidence of author’s pen or actor’s voice but suited in like conditions as our argument to tell you fair beholders that our play leaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils beginning in the middle starting thence away to what may be digested in a play
like or find fault do as your pleasures are now good or bad ’tis but the chance of war
call here my varlet i’ll unarm again
why should i war without the walls of troy that find such cruel battle here within
each trojan that is master of his heart let him to field troilus alas
will this gear ne’er be mended
the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant but i am weaker than a woman’s tear tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance less valiant than the virgin in the night and skilless as unpractis’d infancy
well i have told you enough of this for my part i’ll not meddle nor make no farther
he that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding
ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting
ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
ay to the leavening but here’s yet in the word ‘hereafter’ the kneading the making of the cake the heating of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too or you may chance burn your lips
patience herself what goddess e’er she be doth lesser blench at suff’rance than i do
at priam’s royal table do i sit and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts so traitor
well she look’d yesternight fairer than ever i saw her look or any woman else
i was about to tell thee when my heart as wedged with a sigh would rive in twain lest hector or my father should perceive me i have as when the sun doth light a storm buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
but sorrow that is couch’d in seeming gladness is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen’s well go to there were no more comparison between the women
but for my part she is my kinswoman i would not as they term it praise her but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as i did
i will not dispraise your sister cassandra’s wit but— troilus
i tell thee pandarus when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown’d reply not in how many fathoms deep they lie indrench’d
i tell thee i am mad in cressid’s love
thou answer’st ‘she is fair’ pour’st in the open ulcer of my heart her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice handlest in thy discourse
that her hand in whose comparison all whites are ink writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure the cygnet’s down is harsh and spirit of sense hard as the palm of ploughman
this thou tell’st me as true thou tell’st me when i say i love her but saying thus instead of oil and balm thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me the knife that made it
i speak no more than truth
thou dost not speak so much
let her be as she is if she be fair ’tis the better for her and she be not she has the mends in her own hands
i have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but small thanks for my labour
because she’s kin to me therefore she’s not so fair as helen
and she were not kin to me she would be as fair on friday as helen is on sunday
i care not and she were a blackamoor ’tis all one to me
say i she is not fair
i do not care whether you do or no
she’s a fool to stay behind her father
let her to the greeks and so i’ll tell her the next time i see her
for my part i’ll meddle nor make no more i’ the matter
pray you speak no more to me i will leave all as i found it and there an end
helen must needs be fair when with your blood you daily paint her thus
i cannot fight upon this argument it is too starv’d a subject for my sword
i cannot come to cressid but by pandar and he’s as tetchy to be woo’d to woo as she is stubborn chaste against all suit
tell me apollo for thy daphne’s love what cressid is what pandar and what we
her bed is india there she lies a pearl between our ilium and where she resides let it be call’d the wild and wandering flood ourself the merchant and this sailing pandar our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
this woman’s answer sorts for womanish it is to be from thence
what news aeneas from the field today
that paris is returned home and hurt
let paris bleed ’tis but a scar to scorn paris is gor’d with menelaus’ horn
hark what good sport is out of town today
better at home if ‘would i might’ were ‘may ’ but to the sport abroad
enter cressida and her man alexander
up to the eastern tower whose height commands as subject all the vale to see the battle
hector whose patience is as a virtue fix’d today was mov’d
he chid andromache and struck his armourer and like as there were husbandry in war before the sun rose he was harness’d light and to the field goes he where every flower did as a prophet weep what it foresaw in hector’s wrath
what was his cause of anger
the noise goes this there is among the greeks a lord of trojan blood nephew to hector they call him ajax
they say he is a very man per se and stands alone
so do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs
this man lady hath robb’d many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant—a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crush’d into folly his folly sauced with discretion
there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of everything but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use or purblind argus all eyes and no sight
but how should this man that makes me smile make hector angry
they say he yesterday cop’d hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept hector fasting and waking
as may be in the world lady
what do you talk of —good morrow alexander —how do you cousin
what were you talking of when i came
was hector arm’d and gone ere you came to ilium
helen was not up was she
hector was gone but helen was not up
that were we talking of and of his anger
true he was so i know the cause too he’ll lay about him today i can tell them that
and there’s troilus will not come far behind him let them take heed of troilus i can tell them that too
troilus is the better man of the two
what not between troilus and hector
do you know a man if you see him
ay if i ever saw him before and knew him
well i say troilus is troilus
then you say as i say for i am sure he is not hector
no nor hector is not troilus in some degrees
’tis just to each of them he is himself
condition i had gone barefoot to india
well the gods are above time must friend or end
i would my heart were in her body
no hector is not a better man than troilus
th’other’s not come to’t you shall tell me another tale when th’other’s come to’t
hector shall not have his wit this year
he shall not need it if he have his own
’twould not become him his own’s better
helen herself swore th’other day that troilus for a brown favour for so ’tis i must confess—not brown neither— cressida
faith to say truth brown and not brown
to say the truth true and not true
she prais’d his complexion above paris
then troilus should have too much
if she prais’d him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming a praise for a good complexion
i had as lief helen’s golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose
i swear to you i think helen loves him better than paris
then she’s a merry greek indeed
nay i am sure she does
she came to him th’other day into the compass’d window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin— cressida
indeed a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total
why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother hector
is he so young a man and so old a lifter
but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin— cressida
i think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all phrygia
o yes an ’twere a cloud in autumn
but to prove to you that helen loves troilus— cressida
troilus will stand to the proof if you’ll prove it so
why he esteems her no more than i esteem an addle egg
if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i’ th’ shell
i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin
indeed she has a marvell’s white hand i must needs confess
and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
queen hecuba laugh’d that her eyes ran o’er
but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes
did her eyes run o’er too
at what was all this laughing
marry at the white hair that helen spied on troilus’ chin
and’t had been a green hair i should have laugh’d too
they laugh’d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer
quoth she ‘here’s but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white ’ cressida
that’s true make no question of that
‘two and fifty hairs ’ quoth he ‘and one white
that white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons ’ ‘jupiter ’ quoth she ‘which of these hairs is paris my husband ’ ‘the forked one ’ quoth he ’pluck’t out and give it him ’ but there was such laughing
and helen so blush’d and paris so chaf’d and all the rest so laugh’d that it pass’d
so let it now for it has been a great while going by
well cousin i told you a thing yesterday think on’t
i’ll be sworn ’tis true he will weep you and ’twere a man born in april
and i’ll spring up in his tears an ’twere a nettle against may
they are coming from the field
shall we stand up here and see them as they pass toward ilium
good niece do sweet niece cressida
here here here’s an excellent place here we may see most bravely
i’ll tell you them all by their names as they pass by but mark troilus above the rest
is not that a brave man
he’s one of the flowers of troy i can tell you
but mark troilus you shall see anon
he has a shrewd wit i can tell you and he’s a man good enough he’s one o’ th’ soundest judgements in troy whosoever and a proper man of person
if he see me you shall see him nod at me
will he give you the nod
if he do the rich shall have more
that’s hector that that look you that there’s a fellow
it does a man’s heart good
look you what hacks are on his helmet
look you yonder do you see
there’s no jesting there’s laying on take’t off who will as they say
anything he cares not and the devil come to him it’s all one
by god’s lid it does one’s heart good
yonder comes paris yonder comes paris
look ye yonder niece is’t not a gallant man too is’t not
who said he came hurt home today
why this will do helen’s heart good now ha
would i could see troilus now
i think he went not forth today
do you not hear the people cry ‘troilus’ —helenus is a priest
brave troilus the prince of chivalry
look well upon him niece look you how his sword is bloodied and his helm more hack’d than hector’s and how he looks and how he goes
he never saw three and twenty
go thy way troilus go thy way
had i a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess he should take his choice
paris is dirt to him and i warrant helen to change would give an eye to boot
chaff and bran chaff and bran
i could live and die in the eyes of troilus
ne’er look ne’er look the eagles are gone
crows and daws crows and daws
i had rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and all greece
there is amongst the greeks achilles a better man than troilus
a drayman a porter a very camel
do you know what a man is
is not birth beauty good shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth liberality and such like the spice and salt that season a man
ay a minc’d man and then to be bak’d with no date in the pie for then the man’s date is out
a man knows not at what ward you lie
upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards i lie at a thousand watches
nay i’ll watch you for that and that’s one of the chiefest of them too
if i cannot ward what i would not have hit i can watch you for telling how i took the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it’s past watching
sir my lord would instantly speak with you
at your own house there he unarms him
good boy tell him i come
i will be with you niece by and by
by the same token you are a bawd
words vows gifts tears and love’s full sacrifice he offers in another’s enterprise but more in troilus thousand fold i see than in the glass of pandar’s praise may be yet hold i off
women are angels wooing things won are done joy’s soul lies in the doing
that she belov’d knows naught that knows not this men prize the thing ungain’d more than it is
that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue therefore this maxim out of love i teach ‘achievement is command ungain’d beseech ’ then though my heart’s content firm love doth bear nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear
enter agamemnon nestor ulysses diomedes menelaus and others
princes what grief hath set these jaundies o’er your cheeks
the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promis’d largeness checks and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest rear’d as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infects the sound pine and diverts his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth
nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years’ siege yet troy walls stand sith every action that hath gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bias and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gave’t surmised shape
why then you princes do you with cheeks abash’d behold our works and call them shames which are indeed naught else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortune’s love
for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affin’d and kin
but in the wind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what hath mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled
with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words
in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men
the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk
but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strong ribb’d bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus’ horse
where’s then the saucy boat whose weak untimber’d sides but even now co rivall’d greatness
either to harbour fled or made a toast for neptune
even so doth valour’s show and valour’s worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shade—why then the thing of courage as rous’d with rage with rage doth sympathise and with an accent tun’d in self same key retorts to chiding fortune
agamemnon thou great commander nerve and bone of greece heart of our numbers soul and only spirit in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up—hear what ulysses speaks
besides th’applause and approbation the which to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway to nestor and thou most reverend for thy stretch’d out life i give to both your speeches—which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass and such again as venerable nestor hatch’d in silver should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree on which heaven rides knit all the greekish ears to his experienc’d tongue—yet let it please both thou great and wise to hear ulysses speak
speak prince of ithaca and be’t of less expect that matter needless of importless burden divide thy lips than we are confident when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws we shall hear music wit and oracle
troy yet upon his basis had been down and the great hector’s sword had lack’d a master but for these instances the specialty of rule hath been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected
degree being vizarded th’unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask
the heavens themselves the planets and this centre observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthron’d and spher’d amidst the other whose med’cinable eye corrects the influence of evil planets and posts like the commandment of a king sans check to good and bad
but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds
frights changes horrors divert and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixture
o when degree is shak’d which is the ladder of all high designs the enterprise is sick
how could communities degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities peaceful commerce from dividable shores the primogenity and due of birth prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels but by degree stand in authentic place
take but degree away untune that string and hark what discord follows
each thing melts in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right or rather right and wrong— between whose endless jar justice resides— should lose their names and so should justice too
then everything includes itself in power power into will will into appetite and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself
great agamemnon this chaos when degree is suffocate follows the choking
and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it hath to climb
the general’s disdain’d by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampl’d by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation
and ’tis this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews
to end a tale of length troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
most wisely hath ulysses here discover’d the fever whereof all our power is sick
the nature of the sickness found ulysses what is the remedy
the great achilles whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host having his ear full of his airy fame grows dainty of his worth and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests and with ridiculous and awkward action— which slanderer he imitation calls— he pageants us
sometime great agamemnon thy topless deputation he puts on and like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound ’twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage— such to be pitied and o’er wrested seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks ’tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquar’d which from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp’d would seem hyperboles
at this fusty stuff the large achilles on his press’d bed lolling from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause cries ‘excellent
now play me nestor hem and stroke thy beard as he being drest to some oration ’ that’s done—as near as the extremest ends of parallels as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries ‘excellent
now play him me patroclus arming to answer in a night alarm ’ and then forsooth the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit and with a palsy fumbling on his gorget shake in and out the rivet
and at this sport sir valour dies cries ‘o enough patroclus or give me ribs of steel
i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen ’ and in this fashion all our abilities gifts natures shapes severals and generals of grace exact achievements plots orders preventions excitements to the field or speech for truce success or loss what is or is not serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes
and in the imitation of these twain— who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voice—many are infect
ajax is grown self will’d and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger
they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall prescience and esteem no act but that of hand
the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies’ weight— why this hath not a finger’s dignity they call this bed work mapp’ry closet war so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution
let this be granted and achilles’ horse makes many thetis’ sons
what would you fore our tent
is this great agamemnon’s tent i pray you
may one that is a herald and a prince do a fair message to his kingly eyes
with surety stronger than achilles’ arm fore all the greekish heads which with one voice call agamemnon head and general
how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals
ay i ask that i might waken reverence and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus
which is that god in office guiding men
which is the high and mighty agamemnon
this trojan scorns us or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers
courtiers as free as debonair unarm’d as bending angels that’s their fame in peace
but when they would seem soldiers they have galls good arms strong joints true swords and jove’s accord nothing so full of heart
but peace aeneas peace trojan lay thy finger on thy lips
the worthiness of praise distains his worth if that the prais’d himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends that breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends
sir you of troy call you yourself aeneas
ay greek that is my name
what’s your affairs i pray you
sir pardon ’tis for agamemnon’s ears
agamemnon he hears naught privately that comes from troy
nor i from troy come not to whisper with him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear to set his sense on the attentive bent and then to speak
speak frankly as the wind it is not agamemnon’s sleeping hour
that thou shalt know trojan he is awake he tells thee so himself
trumpet blow loud send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents and every greek of mettle let him know what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
we have great agamemnon here in troy a prince called hector—priam is his father— who in this dull and long continued truce is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet and to this purpose speak kings princes lords
if there be one among the fair’st of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease that feeds his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valour and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in confession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers—to him this challenge
hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he hath a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did couple in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call mid way between your tents and walls of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love
if any come hector shall honour him if none he’ll say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance
this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas
if none of them have soul in such a kind we left them all at home
but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not hath not or is not in love
if then one is or hath or means to be that one meets hector if none else i am he
tell him of nestor one that was a man when hector’s grandsire suck’d
he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host a noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vambrace put this wither’d brawns and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world
his youth in flood i’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood
now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth
fair lord aeneas let me touch your hand to our pavilion shall i lead you sir
achilles shall have word of this intent so shall each lord of greece from tent to tent
yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe
exeunt all but ulysses and nestor
i have a young conception in my brain be you my time to bring it to some shape
this ’tis blunt wedges rive hard knots
the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropp’d or shedding breed a nursery of like evil to overbulk us all
this challenge that the gallant hector sends however it is spread in general name relates in purpose only to achilles
the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libya—though apollo knows ’tis dry enough—will with great speed of judgement ay with celerity find hector’s purpose pointing on him
and wake him to the answer think you
who may you else oppose that can from hector bring those honours off if not achilles
though ’t be a sportful combat yet in this trial much opinion dwells for here the trojans taste our dear’st repute with their fin’st palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly pois’d in this vile action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large
it is suppos’d he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as ’twere from forth us all a man distill’d out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence a conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves
which entertain’d limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs
therefore ’tis meet achilles meet not hector
let us like merchants first show foul wares and think perchance they’ll sell if not the lustre of the better shall exceed by showing the worse first
do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet for both our honour and our shame in this are dogg’d with two strange followers
i see them not with my old eyes
what glory our achilles shares from hector were he not proud we all should share with him but he already is too insolent and it were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes should he scape hector fair
if he were foil’d why then we do our main opinion crush in taint of our best man
no make a lott’ry and by device let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector
among ourselves give him allowance for the better man for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends
if the dull brainless ajax come safe off we’ll dress him up in voices if he fail yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men
but hit or miss our project’s life this shape of sense assumes— ajax employ’d plucks down achilles’ plumes
now ulysses i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste thereof forthwith to agamemnon
two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on as ’twere their bone
agamemnon—how if he had boils full all over generally
and those boils did run—say so
did not the general run then
were not that a botchy core
then there would come some matter from him i see none now
thou bitch wolf’s son canst thou not hear
the plague of greece upon thee thou mongrel beef witted lord
speak then thou unsalted leaven speak
i will beat thee into handsomeness
i shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but i think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book
a red murrain o’ thy jade’s tricks
dost thou think i have no sense thou strikest me thus
thou art proclaim’d fool i think
do not porpentine do not my fingers itch
i would thou didst itch from head to foot and i had the scratching of thee i would make thee the loathsomest scab in greece
when thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another
thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpina’s beauty—ay that thou bark’st at him
he would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit
ay do do thou sodden witted lord
thou hast no more brain than i have in mine elbows an asinico may tutor thee
thou art here but to thrash trojans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave
if thou use to beat me i will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou
do rudeness do camel do do
you see him there do you
but yet you look not well upon him for whosomever you take him to be he is ajax
ay but that fool knows not himself
lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters
his evasions have ears thus long
i have bobb’d his brain more than he has beat my bones
i will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow
this lord achilles—ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head—i’ll tell you what i say of him
i say this ajax— ajax offers to strike him
has not so much wit— achilles
as will stop the eye of helen’s needle for whom he comes to fight
i would have peace and quietness but the fool will not— he there that he look you there
will you set your wit to a fool’s
no i warrant you the fool’s will shame it
i bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation and he rails upon me
your last service was suff’rance ’twas not voluntary
ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impress
e’en so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars
hector shall have a great catch and knock out either of your brains a’ were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel
there’s ulysses and old nestor—whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes—yoke you like draught oxen and make you plough up the wars
to achilles to ajax to— ajax
i shall cut out your tongue
’tis no matter i shall speak as much as thou afterwards
i will hold my peace when achilles’ brach bids me shall i
i will see you hang’d like clotpoles ere i come any more to your tents
i will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools
marry this sir is proclaim’d through all our host that hector by the fifth hour of the sun will with a trumpet ’twixt our tents and troy tomorrow morning call some knight to arms that hath a stomach and such a one that dare maintain i know not what ’tis trash
i know not ’tis put to lott’ry otherwise he knew his man
i will go learn more of it
enter priam hector troilus paris and helenus
after so many hours lives speeches spent thus once again says nestor from the greeks ‘deliver helen and all damage else— as honour loss of time travail expense wounds friends and what else dear that is consum’d in hot digestion of this cormorant war— shall be struck off ’ hector what say you to’t
though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out ‘who knows what follows ’ than hector is
the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is call’d the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to th’ bottom of the worst
since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul ’mongst many thousand dismes hath been as dear as helen—i mean of ours
if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten what merit’s in that reason which denies the yielding of her up
weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread father’s in a scale of common ounces
will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons
no marvel though you bite so sharp of reasons you are so empty of them
should not our father bear the great sway of his affairs with reason because your speech hath none that tells him so
you are for dreams and slumbers brother priest you fur your gloves with reason
here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm you know a sword employ’d is perilous and reason flies the object of all harm
who marvels then when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove or like a star disorb’d
nay if we talk of reason let’s shut our gates and sleep
manhood and honour should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts with this cramm’d reason
reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject
brother she is not worth what she doth cost the keeping
what’s aught but as ’tis valued
but value dwells not in particular will it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein ’tis precious of itself as in the prizer
’tis mad idolatry to make the service greater than the god and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects without some image of th’affected merit
i take today a wife and my election is led on in the conduct of my will my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores of will and judgement how may i avoid although my will distaste what it elected the wife i chose
there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour
we turn not back the silks upon the merchant when we have soil’d them nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve because we now are full
it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath with full consent bellied his sails the seas and winds old wranglers took a truce and did him service
he touch’d the ports desir’d and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive he brought a grecian queen whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollo’s and makes stale the morning
why she is a pearl whose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships and turn’d crown’d kings to merchants
if you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom paris went— as you must needs for you all cried ‘go go’— if you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize— as you must needs for you all clapp’d your hands and cried ‘inestimable ’—why do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate and do a deed that never fortune did— beggar the estimation which you priz’d richer than sea and land
o theft most base that we have stol’n what we do fear to keep
but thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n that in their country did them that disgrace we fear to warrant in our native place
what noise what shriek is this
’tis our mad sister i do know her voice
lend me ten thousand eyes and i will fill them with prophetic tears
virgins and boys mid age and wrinkled eld soft infancy that nothing canst but cry add to my clamours
let us pay betimes a moiety of that mass of moan to come
troy must not be nor goodly ilion stand our firebrand brother paris burns us all
cry trojans cry a helen and a woe
troy burns or else let helen go
now youthful troilus do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse
or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same
why brother hector we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it nor once deject the courage of our minds because cassandra’s mad
her brain sick raptures cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engag’d to make it gracious
for my private part i am no more touch’d than all priam’s sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain
else might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels but i attest the gods your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fears attending on so dire a project
for what alas can these my single arms
what propugnation is in one man’s valour to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite
yet i protest were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will paris should ne’er retract what he hath done nor faint in the pursuit
paris you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights
you have the honey still but these the gall so to be valiant is no praise at all
sir i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it but i would have the soil of her fair rape wip’d off in honourable keeping her
what treason were it to the ransack’d queen disgrace to your great worths and shame to me now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion
can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms
there’s not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended nor none so noble whose life were ill bestow’d or death unfam’d where helen is the subject
then i say well may we fight for her whom we know well the world’s large spaces cannot parallel
paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have gloz’d but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy
the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemp’red blood than to make up a free determination ’twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision
nature craves all dues be rend’red to their owners
now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband
if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills resist the same there is a law in each well order’d nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory
if helen then be wife to sparta’s king— as it is known she is—these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back return’d
thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong but makes it much more heavy
hector’s opinion is this in way of truth
yet ne’ertheless my spritely brethren i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still for ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependence upon our joint and several dignities
why there you touch’d the life of our design
were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence
but worthy hector she is a theme of honour and renown a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds whose present courage may beat down our foes and fame in time to come canonize us for i presume brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promis’d glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world’s revenue
i am yours you valiant offspring of great priamus
i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dull and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
i was advertis’d their great general slept whilst emulation in the army crept
this i presume will wake him
what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury
shall the elephant ajax carry it thus
he beats me and i rail at him
would it were otherwise that i could beat him whilst he rail’d at me
‘sfoot i’ll learn to conjure and raise devils but i’ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations
then there’s achilles a rare engineer
if troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves
o thou great thunder darter of olympus forget that thou art jove the king of gods and mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have
which short arm’d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web
after this the vengeance on the whole camp
or rather the neapolitan bone ache
for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket
i have said my prayers and devil envy say ‘amen ’ what ho
good thersites come in and rail
if i could a’ rememb’red a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipp’d out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself
the common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue
heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee
let thy blood be thy direction till thy death
then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse i’ll be sworn and sworn upon’t she never shrouded any but lazars
why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals
then tell me patroclus what’s achilles
then tell me i pray thee what’s thersites
then tell me patroclus what art thou
agamemnon commands achilles achilles is my lord i am patroclus’ knower and patroclus is a fool
agamemnon is a fool achilles is a fool thersites is a fool and as aforesaid patroclus is a fool
agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and this patroclus is a fool positive
make that demand of the creator
enter agamemnon ulysses nestor diomedes ajax and calchas
come patroclus i’ll speak with nobody
here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery
all the argument is a whore and a cuckold—a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon
now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all
within his tent but ill dispos’d my lord
let it be known to him that we are here
he sate our messengers and we lay by our appertainings visiting of him
let him be told so lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place or know not what we are
i shall say so to him
we saw him at the opening of his tent
yes lion sick sick of proud heart
you may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head ’tis pride
let him show us a cause
what moves ajax thus to bay at him
achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
then will ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
no you see he is his argument that has his argument achilles
all the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction
but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite
the amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie
the elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure
achilles bids me say he is much sorry if any thing more than your sport and pleasure did move your greatness and this noble state to call upon him he hopes it is no other but for your health and your digestion sake an after dinner’s breath
we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion wing’d thus swift with scorn cannot outfly our apprehensions
much attribute he hath and much the reason why we ascribe it to him
yet all his virtues not virtuously on his own part beheld do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish are like to rot untasted
go and tell him we come to speak with him and you shall not sin if you do say we think him over proud and under honest in self assumption greater than in the note of judgement and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on disguise the holy strength of their command and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance yea watch his course and time his ebbs and flows as if the passage and whole stream of this commencement rode on his tide
go tell him this and add that if he overhold his price so much we’ll none of him but let him like an engine not portable lie under this report bring action hither this cannot go to war
a stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant
i shall and bring his answer presently
in second voice we’ll not be satisfied we come to speak with him
what is he more than another
no more than what he thinks he is
do you not think he thinks himself a better man than i am
will you subscribe his thought and say he is
no noble ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable
why should a man be proud
i know not what pride is
your mind is the clearer ajax and your virtues the fairer
he that is proud eats up himself
pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise
i do hate a proud man as i do hate the engend’ring of toads
aside and yet he loves himself is’t not strange
achilles will not to the field tomorrow
he doth rely on none but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any in will peculiar and in self admission
why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share th’air with us
things small as nothing for request’s sake only he makes important possess’d he is with greatness and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at self breath
imagin’d worth holds in his blood such swol’n and hot discourse that ’twixt his mental and his active parts kingdom’d achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself
he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it cry ‘no recovery ’ agamemnon
dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
’tis said he holds you well and will be led at your request a little from himself
o agamemnon let it not be so
we’ll consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles
shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve and ruminate himself—shall he be worshipp’d of that we hold an idol more than he
no this thrice worthy and right valiant lord shall not so stale his palm nobly acquir’d nor by my will assubjugate his merit as amply titled as achilles is by going to achilles
that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion
jupiter forbid and say in thunder ‘achilles go to him ’ nestor
he rubs the vein of him
and how his silence drinks up this applause
if i go to him with my armed fist i’ll pash him o’er the face
o no you shall not go
an a’ be proud with me i’ll pheeze his pride
not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
he will be the physician that should be the patient
and all men were o’ my mind— ulysses
wit would be out of fashion
a’ should not bear it so a’ should eat’s words first
i will knead him i’ll make him supple
force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry
my lord you feed too much on this dislike
our noble general do not do so
you must prepare to fight without achilles
why ’tis this naming of him does him harm
here is a man—but ’tis before his face i will be silent
he is not emulous as achilles is
know the whole world he is as valiant
a whoreson dog that shall palter with us thus
what a vice were it in ajax now— ulysses
thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck fam’d be thy tutor and thy parts of nature thrice fam’d beyond beyond all erudition but he that disciplin’d thine arms to fight— let mars divide eternity in twain and give him half and for thy vigour bull bearing milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax
i will not praise thy wisdom which like a bourn a pale a shore confines thy spacious and dilated parts
here’s nestor instructed by the antiquary times— he must he is he cannot but be wise but pardon father nestor were your days as green as ajax’ and your brain so temper’d you should not have the eminence of him but be as ajax
be rul’d by him lord ajax
there is no tarrying here the hart achilles keeps thicket
please it our great general to call together all his state of war fresh kings are come to troy
tomorrow we must with all our main of power stand fast and here’s a lord—come knights from east to west and cull their flower ajax shall cope the best
light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep
do you not follow the young lord paris
ay sir when he goes before me
you depend upon him i mean
sir i do depend upon the lord
you depend upon a notable gentleman i must needs praise him
you know me do you not
friend know me better i am the lord pandarus
i hope i shall know your honour better
you are in the state of grace
not so friend honour and lordship are my titles
i do but partly know sir it is music in parts
at mine sir and theirs that love music
friend we understand not one another i am too courtly and thou art too cunning
at whose request do these men play
marry sir at the request of paris my lord who is there in person with him the mortal venus the heart blood of beauty love’s invisible soul— pandarus
could not you find out that by her attributes
it should seem fellow that thou hast not seen the lady cressida
i come to speak with paris from the prince troilus i will make a complimental assault upon him for my business seethes
fair be to you my lord and to all this fair company
fair desires in all fair measure fairly guide them—especially to you fair queen
fair thoughts be your fair pillow
dear lord you are full of fair words
you speak your fair pleasure sweet queen
fair prince here is good broken music
you have broke it cousin and by my life you shall make it whole again you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance
rude in sooth in good sooth very rude
well you say so in fits
i have business to my lord dear queen
my lord will you vouchsafe me a word
nay this shall not hedge us out
we’ll hear you sing certainly— pandarus
well sweet queen you are pleasant with me
but marry thus my lord my dear lord and most esteemed friend your brother troilus— helen
my lord pandarus honey sweet lord— pandarus
go to sweet queen go to—commends himself most affectionately to you— helen
you shall not bob us out of our melody
if you do our melancholy upon your head
sweet queen sweet queen that’s a sweet queen i’ faith
and to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence
nay that shall not serve your turn that shall it not in truth la
nay i care not for such words no no —and my lord he desires you that if the king call for him at supper you will make his excuse
what says my sweet queen my very very sweet queen
what says my sweet queen —my cousin will fall out with you
you must not know where he sups
i’ll lay my life with my disposer cressida
no no no such matter you are wide
what do you spy —come give me an instrument
my niece is horribly in love with a thing you have sweet queen
she shall have it my lord if it be not my lord paris
no she’ll none of him they two are twain
falling in after falling out may make them three
i’ll hear no more of this i’ll sing you a song now
by my troth sweet lord thou hast a fine forehead
this love will undo us all
ay that it shall i’ faith
ay good now love love nothing but love
in good troth it begins so
love love nothing but love still love still more
for oh love’s bow shoots buck and doe the shaft confounds not that it wounds but tickles still the sore
these lovers cry o ho they die
yet that which seems the wound to kill doth turn o ho
in love i’ faith to the very tip of the nose
he eats nothing but doves love and that breeds hot blood and hot blood begets hot thoughts and hot thoughts beget hot deeds and hot deeds is love
is this the generation of love hot blood hot thoughts and hot deeds
is love a generation of vipers
sweet lord who’s a field today
hector deiphobus helenus antenor and all the gallantry of troy
i would fain have arm’d today but my nell would not have it so
how chance my brother troilus went not
he hangs the lip at something
i long to hear how they spend today
let us to priam’s hall to greet the warriors
sweet helen i must woo you to help unarm our hector
his stubborn buckles with these your white enchanting fingers touch’d shall more obey than to the edge of steel or force of greekish sinews you shall do more than all the island kings—disarm great hector
’twill make us proud to be his servant paris yea what he shall receive of us in duty gives us more palm in beauty than we have yea overshines ourself
sweet above thought i love thee
enter pandarus and troilus’ boy meeting
no sir he stays for you to conduct him thither
i stalk about her door like a strange soul upon the stygian banks staying for waftage
o be thou my charon and give me swift transportance to these fields where i may wallow in the lily beds propos’d for the deserver
o gentle pandar from cupid’s shoulder pluck his painted wings and fly with me to cressid
walk here i’ th’ orchard i’ll bring her straight
i am giddy expectation whirls me round
th’imaginary relish is so sweet that it enchants my sense what will it be when that the wat’ry palate tastes indeed love’s thrice repured nectar
death i fear me sounding destruction or some joy too fine too subtle potent tun’d too sharp in sweetness for the capacity of my ruder powers
i fear it much and i do fear besides that i shall lose distinction in my joys as doth a battle when they charge on heaps the enemy flying
she’s making her ready she’ll come straight you must be witty now
she does so blush and fetches her wind so short as if she were fray’d with a sprite
it is the prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a new ta’en sparrow
even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse and all my powers do their bestowing lose like vassalage at unawares encount’ring the eye of majesty
come come what need you blush
here she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me —what are you gone again
you must be watch’d ere you be made tame must you
come your ways come your ways and you draw backward we’ll put you i’ th’ fills
why do you not speak to her
come draw this curtain and let’s see your picture
alas the day how loath you are to offend daylight
and ’twere dark you’d close sooner
so so rub on and kiss the mistress
how now a kiss in fee farm
build there carpenter the air is sweet
nay you shall fight your hearts out ere i part you
the falcon as the tercel for all the ducks i’ th’ river
you have bereft me of all words lady
words pay no debts give her deeds but she’ll bereave you o’ th’ deeds too if she call your activity in question
here’s ‘in witness whereof the parties interchangeably ’ come in come in i’ll go get a fire
will you walk in my lord
o cressid how often have i wish’d me thus
what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love
more dregs than water if my fears have eyes
fears make devils of cherubins they never see truly
blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear
to fear the worst oft cures the worse
o let my lady apprehend no fear
in all cupid’s pageant there is presented no monster
nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire eat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed
this is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confin’d that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit
they say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one
they that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters
praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it
no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present
we will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble
few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus
will you walk in my lord
have you not done talking yet
well uncle what folly i commit i dedicate to you
i thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you you’ll give him me
be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for it
you know now your hostages your uncle’s word and my firm faith
nay i’ll give my word for her too our kindred though they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burs i can tell you they’ll stick where they are thrown
boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
prince troilus i have lov’d you night and day for many weary months
why was my cressid then so hard to win
hard to seem won but i was won my lord with the first glance that ever—pardon me
if i confess much you will play the tyrant
i love you now but till now not so much but i might master it
in faith i lie my thoughts were like unbridled children grown too headstrong for their mother
who shall be true to us when we are so unsecret to ourselves
but though i lov’d you well i woo’d you not and yet good faith i wish’d myself a man or that we women had men’s privilege of speaking first
sweet bid me hold my tongue for in this rapture i shall surely speak the thing i shall repent
see see your silence cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws my very soul of counsel
and shall albeit sweet music issues thence
my lord i do beseech you pardon me ’twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss
for this time will i take my leave my lord
and you take leave till tomorrow morning— cressida
i have a kind of self resides with you but an unkind self that itself will leave to be another’s fool
i know not what i speak
well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
perchance my lord i show more craft than love and fell so roundly to a large confession to angle for your thoughts but you are wise— or else you love not for to be wise and love exceeds man’s might that dwells with gods above
o that i thought it could be in a woman— as if it can i will presume in you— to feed for aye her lamp and flames of love to keep her constancy in plight and youth outliving beauty’s outward with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays
or that persuasion could but thus convince me that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnowed purity in love
but alas i am as true as truth’s simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth
in that i’ll war with you
o virtuous fight when right with right wars who shall be most right
true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truth by troilus when their rhymes full of protest of oath and big compare want similes truth tir’d with iteration— as true as steel as plantage to the moon as sun to day as turtle to her mate as iron to adamant as earth to th’ centre— yet after all comparisons of truth as truth’s authentic author to be cited ‘as true as troilus’ shall crown up the verse and sanctify the numbers
go to a bargain made seal it seal it i’ll be the witness
here i hold your hand here my cousin’s
if ever you prove false one to another since i have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goers between be call’d to the world’s end after my name—call them all pandars let all constant men be troiluses all false women cressids and all brokers between pandars
whereupon i will show you a chamber and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death
and cupid grant all tongue tied maidens here bed chamber pander to provide this gear
enter agamemnon ulysses diomedes nestor ajax menelaus and calchas
now princes for the service i have done th’advantage of the time prompts me aloud to call for recompense
what wouldst thou of us trojan
you have a trojan prisoner call’d antenor yesterday took troy holds him very dear
oft have you—often have you thanks therefore— desir’d my cressid in right great exchange whom troy hath still denied but this antenor i know is such a wrest in their affairs that their negotiations all must slack wanting his manage and they will almost give us a prince of blood a son of priam in change of him
let him be sent great princes and he shall buy my daughter and her presence shall quite strike off all service i have done in most accepted pain
let diomedes bear him and bring us cressid hither
calchas shall have what he requests of us
good diomed furnish you fairly for this interchange withal bring word if hector will tomorrow be answer’d in his challenge
this shall i undertake and ’tis a burden which i am proud to bear
achilles and patroclus stand in their tent
achilles stands i’ th’entrance of his tent
please it our general pass strangely by him as if he were forgot and princes all lay negligent and loose regard upon him
’tis like he’ll question me why such unplausive eyes are bent why turn’d on him
if so i have derision med’cinable to use between your strangeness and his pride which his own will shall have desire to drink
pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees
we’ll execute your purpose and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along
so do each lord and either greet him not or else disdainfully which shall shake him more than if not look’d on
what comes the general to speak with me
i’ll fight no more ’gainst troy
would you my lord aught with the general
what does the cuckold scorn me
ay and good next day too
they were us’d to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles to come as humbly as they us’d to creep to holy altars
what am i poor of late
’tis certain greatness once fall’n out with fortune must fall out with men too
what the declin’d is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man hath any honour but honour for those honours that are without him as place riches and favour prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that lean’d on them as slippery too doth one pluck down another and together die in the fall
but ’tis not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess save these men’s looks who do methinks find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given
a strange fellow here writes me that man—how dearly ever parted how much in having or without or in— cannot make boast to have that which he hath nor feels not what he owes but by reflection as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver
the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not but commends itself to others’ eyes nor doth the eye itself— that most pure spirit of sense—behold itself not going from itself but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each other’s form for speculation turns not to itself till it hath travell’d and is mirror’d there where it may see itself
this is not strange at all
i do not strain at the position— it is familiar—but at the author’s drift who in his circumstance expressly proves that no man is the lord of anything though in and of him there be much consisting till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them formed in the applause where th’are extended who like an arch reverb’rate the voice again or like a gate of steel fronting the sun receives and renders back his figure and his heat
i was much rapt in this and apprehended here immediately th’unknown ajax
heavens what a man is there
a very horse that has he knows not what
nature what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use
what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth
now shall we see tomorrow— an act that very chance doth throw upon him— ajax renown’d
o heavens what some men do while some men leave to do
how some men creep in skittish fortune’s hall whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
how one man eats into another’s pride while pride is fasting in his wantonness
to see these grecian lords —why even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder as if his foot were on brave hector’s breast and great troy shrieking
i do believe it for they pass’d by me as misers do by beggars neither gave to me good word nor look
time hath my lord a wallet at his back wherein he puts alms for oblivion a great siz’d monster of ingratitudes
those scraps are good deeds past which are devour’d as fast as they are made forgot as soon as done
perseverance dear my lord keeps honour bright
to have done is to hang quite out of fashion like a rusty mail in monumental mock’ry
take the instant way for honour travels in a strait so narrow— where one but goes abreast
keep then the path for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way or hedge aside from the direct forthright like to an ent’red tide they all rush by and leave you hindmost or like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank lie there for pavement to the abject rear o’er run and trampled on
then what they do in present though less than yours in past must o’ertop yours for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by th’hand and with his arms out stretch’d as he would fly grasps in the comer
the welcome ever smiles and farewell goes out sighing
o let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was for beauty wit high birth vigour of bone desert in service love friendship charity are subjects all to envious and calumniating time
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin— that all with one consent praise new born gauds though they are made and moulded of things past and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt o’er dusted
the present eye praises the present object
then marvel not thou great and complete man that all the greeks begin to worship ajax since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not
the cry went once on thee and still it might and yet it may again if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction
of this my privacy i have strong reasons
but ’gainst your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical
’tis known achilles that you are in love with one of priam’s daughters
the providence that’s in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus’ gold finds bottom in th’uncomprehensive deeps keeps place with thought and almost like the gods do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
there is a mystery—with whom relation durst never meddle—in the soul of state which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to
all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours my lord and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena
but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home when fame shall in our island sound her trump and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing ‘great hector’s sister did achilles win but our great ajax bravely beat down him ’ farewell my lord
the fool slides o’er the ice that you should break
to this effect achilles have i mov’d you
a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loath’d than an effeminate man in time of action
i stand condemn’d for this they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus
sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold and like a dew drop from the lion’s mane be shook to air
ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gor’d
o then beware those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger and danger like an ague subtly taints even then when they sit idly in the sun
go call thersites hither sweet patroclus
i’ll send the fool to ajax and desire him t’invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarm’d
i have a woman’s longing an appetite that i am sick withal to see great hector in his weeds of peace to talk with him and to behold his visage even to my full of view
ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
he must fight singly tomorrow with hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing
why a’ stalks up and down like a peacock—a stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say ‘there were wit in this head and ’twould out’ and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking
the man’s undone for ever for if hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat he’ll break’t himself in vainglory
i said ‘good morrow ajax’ and he replies ‘thanks agamemnon ’ what think you of this man that takes me for the general
he’s grown a very land fish languageless a monster
a man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkin
thou must be my ambassador to him thersites
why he’ll answer nobody he professes not answering
speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in’s arms
i will put on his presence
let patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of ajax
tell him i humbly desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarm’d to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six or seven times honour’d captain general of the grecian army agamemnon
i come from the worthy achilles— thersites
who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent— thersites
and to procure safe conduct from agamemnon
god buy you with all my heart
if tomorrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other
howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me
fare ye well with all my heart
why but he is not in this tune is he
no but out of tune thus
what music will be in him when hector has knock’d out his brains i know not but i am sure none unless the fiddler apollo get his sinews to make catlings on
come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
let me bear another to his horse for that’s the more capable creature
my mind is troubled like a fountain stirr’d and i myself see not the bottom of it
would the fountain of your mind were clear again that i might water an ass at it
i had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance
enter at one side aeneas and servant with a torch at another paris deiphobus antenor diomedes the grecian and others with torches
is the prince there in person
had i so good occasion to lie long as you prince paris nothing but heavenly business should rob my bed mate of my company
a valiant greek aeneas—take his hand witness the process of your speech wherein you told how diomed a whole week by days did haunt you in the field
health to you valiant sir during all question of the gentle truce but when i meet you arm’d as black defiance as heart can think or courage execute
the one and other diomed embraces
our bloods are now in calm and so long health
but when contention and occasion meet by jove i’ll play the hunter for thy life with all my force pursuit and policy
and thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly with his face backward
in humane gentleness welcome to troy
now by anchises’ life welcome indeed
by venus’ hand i swear no man alive can love in such a sort the thing he means to kill more excellently
jove let aeneas live if to my sword his fate be not the glory a thousand complete courses of the sun
but in mine emulous honour let him die with every joint a wound and that tomorrow
we do and long to know each other worse
this is the most despiteful gentle greeting the noblest hateful love that e’er i heard of
i was sent for to the king but why i know not
his purpose meets you ’twas to bring this greek to calchas’ house and there to render him for the enfreed antenor the fair cressid
let’s have your company or if you please haste there before us
i constantly believe— or rather call my thought a certain knowledge— my brother troilus lodges there tonight
rouse him and give him note of our approach with the whole quality wherefore i fear we shall be much unwelcome
that i assure you troilus had rather troy were borne to greece than cressid borne from troy
there is no help the bitter disposition of the time will have it so
and tell me noble diomed faith tell me true even in the soul of sound good fellowship who in your thoughts deserves fair helen best myself or menelaus
both alike he merits well to have her that doth seek her not making any scruple of her soilure with such a hell of pain and world of charge and you as well to keep her that defend her not palating the taste of her dishonour with such a costly loss of wealth and friends
he like a puling cuckold would drink up the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece you like a lecher out of whorish loins are pleas’d to breed out your inheritors
both merits pois’d each weighs nor less nor more but he as he the heavier for a whore
you are too bitter to your country woman
hear me paris for every false drop in her bawdy veins a grecian’s life hath sunk for every scruple of her contaminated carrion weight a trojan hath been slain
since she could speak she hath not given so many good words breath as for her greeks and trojans suff’red death
fair diomed you do as chapmen do dispraise the thing that you desire to buy but we in silence hold this virtue well we’ll not commend what we intend to sell
dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold
then sweet my lord i’ll call mine uncle down he shall unbolt the gates
trouble him not to bed to bed
sleep kill those pretty eyes and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants empty of all thought
but that the busy day wak’d by the lark hath rous’d the ribald crows and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer i would not from thee
with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love with wings more momentary swift than thought
you will catch cold and curse me
i might have still held off and then you would have tarried
within what’s all the doors open here
i shall have such a life
go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle
you bring me to do and then you flout me too
what have i brought you to do
you’ll ne’er be good nor suffer others
would he not a naughty man let it sleep
would he were knock’d i’ th’ head
my lord come you again into my chamber
you smile and mock me as if i meant naughtily
come you are deceiv’d i think of no such thing
pray you come in i would not for half troy have you seen here
will you beat down the door
by my troth i knew you not
what news with you so early
come he is here my lord do not deny him
it doth import him much to speak with me
it’s more than i know i’ll be sworn
for my own part i came in late
come come you’ll do him wrong ere you are ware you’ll be so true to him to be false to him
do not you know of him but yet go fetch him hither go
my lord i scarce have leisure to salute you my matter is so rash
there is at hand paris your brother and deiphobus the grecian diomed and our antenor deliver’d to us and for him forthwith ere the first sacrifice within this hour we must give up to diomedes’ hand the lady cressida
by priam and the general state of troy
they are at hand and ready to effect it
i will go meet them and my lord aeneas we met by chance you did not find me here
good good my lord the secrets of neighbour pandar have not more gift in taciturnity
the young prince will go mad
i would they had broke’s neck
tell me sweet uncle what’s the matter
would i were as deep under the earth as i am above
would thou hadst ne’er been born
i knew thou wouldst be his death
good uncle i beseech you on my knees i beseech you what’s the matter
thou must be gone wench thou must be gone thou art chang’d for antenor thou must to thy father and be gone from troilus
’twill be his death ’twill be his bane he cannot bear it
i have forgot my father i know no touch of consanguinity no kin no love no blood no soul so near me as the sweet troilus
o you gods divine make cressid’s name the very crown of falsehood if ever she leave troilus
time force and death do to this body what extremes you can but the strong base and building of my love is as the very centre of the earth drawing all things to it
i’ll go in and weep— pandarus
tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart with sounding ‘troilus ’ i will not go from troy
enter paris troilus aeneas deiphobus antenor and diomedes
it is great morning and the hour prefix’d for her delivery to this valiant greek comes fast upon
good my brother troilus tell you the lady what she is to do and haste her to the purpose
i’ll bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her think it an altar and thy brother troilus a priest there off’ring to it his own heart
i know what ’tis to love and would as i shall pity i could help
please you walk in my lords
why tell you me of moderation
the grief is fine full perfect that i taste and violenteth in a sense as strong as that which causeth it
if i could temporize with my affections or brew it to a weak and colder palate the like allayment could i give my grief
my love admits no qualifying dross no more my grief in such a precious loss
what a pair of spectacles is here
‘o heart ’ as the goodly saying is — o heart heavy heart why sigh’st thou without breaking
where he answers again because thou canst not ease thy smart by friendship nor by speaking
there was never a truer rhyme
let us cast away nothing for we may live to have need of such a verse
we see it we see it
cressid i love thee in so strain’d a purity that the bless’d gods as angry with my fancy more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
ay ay ay ay ’tis too plain a case
and is it true that i must go from troy
and suddenly where injury of chance puts back leave taking justles roughly by all time of pause rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure forcibly prevents our lock’d embrasures strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath
we two that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one
injurious time now with a robber’s haste crams his rich thiev’ry up he knows not how
as many farewells as be stars in heaven with distinct breath and consign’d kisses to them he fumbles up into a loose adieu and scants us with a single famish’d kiss distasted with the salt of broken tears
my lord is the lady ready
some say the genius cries so to him that instantly must die
bid them have patience she shall come anon
rain to lay this wind or my heart will be blown up by my throat
i must then to the grecians
a woeful cressid ’mongst the merry greeks
be thou but true of heart
nay we must use expostulation kindly for it is parting from us
i speak not ‘be thou true’ as fearing thee for i will throw my glove to death himself that there’s no maculation in thy heart but ‘be thou true’ say i to fashion in my sequent protestation be thou true and i will see thee
you shall be expos’d my lord to dangers as infinite as imminent
and i’ll grow friend with danger
i will corrupt the grecian sentinels to give thee nightly visitation
hear why i speak it love
the grecian youths are full of quality they’re loving well compos’d with gifts of nature flowing and swelling o’er with arts and exercise
how novelty may move and parts with person alas a kind of godly jealousy which i beseech you call a virtuous sin makes me afear’d
in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit
i cannot sing nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk nor play at subtle games fair virtues all to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and dumb discoursive devil that tempts most cunningly
but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves when we will tempt the frailty of our powers presuming on their changeful potency
come kiss and let us part
good brother come you hither and bring aeneas and the grecian with you
my lord will you be true
alas it is my vice my fault
whiles others fish with craft for great opinion i with great truth catch mere simplicity whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare
fear not my truth the moral of my wit is plain and true there’s all the reach of it
enter aeneas paris antenor deiphobus and diomedes
here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port lord i’ll give her to thy hand and by the way possess thee what she is
entreat her fair and by my soul fair greek if e’er thou stand at mercy of my sword name cressid and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilion
fair lady cressid so please you save the thanks this prince expects
the lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek pleads your fair usage and to diomed you shall be mistress and command him wholly
grecian thou dost not use me courteously to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her
i tell thee lord of greece she is as far high soaring o’er thy praises as thou unworthy to be call’d her servant
i charge thee use her well even for my charge for by the dreadful pluto if thou dost not though the great bulk achilles be thy guard i’ll cut thy throat
o be not mov’d prince troilus
let me be privileg’d by my place and message to be a speaker free when i am hence i’ll answer to my lust
and know you lord i’ll nothing do on charge to her own worth she shall be priz’d
but that you say ‘be’t so ’ i speak it in my spirit and honour ‘no ’ troilus
i’ll tell thee diomed this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head
lady give me your hand and as we walk to our own selves bend we our needful talk
how have we spent this morning
the prince must think me tardy and remiss that swore to ride before him to the field
come come to field with him
yea with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity let us address to tend on hector’s heels
the glory of our troy doth this day lie on his fair worth and single chivalry
enter ajax armed agamemnon achilles patroclus menelaus ulysses nestor and others
here art thou in appointment fresh and fair anticipating time with starting courage
give with thy trumpet a loud note to troy thou dreadful ajax that the appalled air may pierce the head of the great combatant and hale him hither
now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek out swell the colic of puff’d aquilon
come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood thou blowest for hector
is not yond diomed with calchas’ daughter
’tis he i ken the manner of his gait he rises on the toe
that spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the earth
most dearly welcome to the greeks sweet lady
our general doth salute you with a kiss
yet is the kindness but particular ’twere better she were kiss’d in general
and very courtly counsel i’ll begin
i’ll take that winter from your lips fair lady
i had good argument for kissing once
but that’s no argument for kissing now for thus popp’d paris in his hardiment and parted thus you and your argument
o deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
for which we lose our heads to gild his horns
the first was menelaus’ kiss this mine patroclus kisses you
paris and i kiss evermore for him
in kissing do you render or receive
i’ll make my match to live the kiss you take is better than you give therefore no kiss
i’ll give you boot i’ll give you three for one
you are an odd man give even or give none
no paris is not for you know ’tis true that you are odd and he is even with you
it were no match your nail against his horn
may i sweet lady beg a kiss of you
why then for venus’ sake give me a kiss when helen is a maid again and his
i am your debtor claim it when ’tis due
never’s my day and then a kiss of you
i’ll bring you to your father
there’s language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body
these encounterers so glib of tongue that give a coasting welcome ere it comes and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every tickling reader
set them down for sluttish spoils of opportunity and daughters of the game
enter hector armed aeneas troilus paris deiphobus and other trojans with attendants
hail all you state of greece
what shall be done to him that victory commands
or do you purpose a victor shall be known
will you the knights shall to the edge of all extremity pursue each other or shall be divided by any voice or order of the field
which way would hector have it
he cares not he’ll obey conditions
but securely done a little proudly and great deal misprising the knight oppos’d
if not achilles sir what is your name
but whate’er know this in the extremity of great and little valour and pride excel themselves in hector the one almost as infinite as all the other blank as nothing
weigh him well and that which looks like pride is courtesy
this ajax is half made of hector’s blood in love whereof half hector stays at home half heart half hand half hector comes to seek this blended knight half trojan and half greek
go gentle knight stand by our ajax
as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight so be it either to the uttermost or else a breath
the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin
ajax and hector enter the lists
what trojan is that same that looks so heavy
the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provok’d nor being provok’d soon calm’d his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty nor dignifies an impure thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love
they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector
thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me
i am not warm yet let us fight again
why then will i no more
by him that thunders thou hast lusty arms hector would have them fall upon him thus
thou art too gentle and too free a man
i came to kill thee cousin and bear hence a great addition earned in thy death
not neoptolemus so mirable on whose bright crest fame with her loud’st oyes cries ‘this is he ’ could promise to himself a thought of added honour torn from hector
there is expectance here from both the sides what further you will do
we’ll answer it the issue is embracement
if i might in entreaties find success as seld’ i have the chance i would desire my famous cousin to our grecian tents
’tis agamemnon’s wish and great achilles doth long to see unarm’d the valiant hector
aeneas call my brother troilus to me and signify this loving interview to the expecters of our trojan part desire them home
give me thy hand my cousin i will go eat with thee and see your knights
agamemnon and the rest of the greeks come forward
great agamemnon comes to meet us here
the worthiest of them tell me name by name but for achilles my own searching eyes shall find him by his large and portly size
as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy
understand more clear what’s past and what’s to come is strew’d with husks and formless ruin of oblivion but in this extant moment faith and troth strain’d purely from all hollow bias drawing bids thee with most divine integrity from heart of very heart great hector welcome
i thank thee most imperious agamemnon
to troilus my well fam’d lord of troy no less to you
let me confirm my princely brother’s greeting
you brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
mock not that i affect the untraded oath your quondam wife swears still by venus’ glove
she’s well but bade me not commend her to you
name her not now sir she’s a deadly theme
i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft labouring for destiny make cruel way through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed despising many forfeits and subduements when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i’ th’air not letting it decline on the declined that i have said to some my standers by ‘lo jupiter is yonder dealing life ’ and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath when that a ring of greeks have shrap’d thee in like an olympian wrestling
this have i seen but this thy countenance still lock’d in steel i never saw till now
i knew thy grandsire and once fought with him
he was a soldier good but by great mars the captain of us all never like thee
o let an old man embrace thee and worthy warrior welcome to our tents
let me embrace thee good old chronicle that hast so long walk’d hand in hand with time
most reverend nestor i am glad to clasp thee
i would my arms could match thee in contention as they contend with thee in courtesy
by this white beard i’d fight with thee tomorrow
i wonder now how yonder city stands when we have here her base and pillar by us
i know your favour lord ulysses well
ah sir there’s many a greek and trojan dead since first i saw yourself and diomed in ilion on your greekish embassy
sir i foretold you then what would ensue
my prophecy is but half his journey yet for yonder walls that pertly front your town yon towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds must kiss their own feet
there they stand yet and modestly i think the fall of every phrygian stone will cost a drop of grecian blood
the end crowns all and that old common arbitrator time will one day end it
so to him we leave it
most gentle and most valiant hector welcome
after the general i beseech you next to feast with me and see me at my tent
i shall forestall thee lord ulysses thou
now hector i have fed mine eyes on thee i have with exact view perus’d thee hector and quoted joint by joint
stand fair i pray thee let me look on thee
i will the second time as i would buy thee view thee limb by limb
o like a book of sport thou’lt read me o’er but there’s more in me than thou understand’st
why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
tell me you heavens in which part of his body shall i destroy him
whether there or there or there
that i may give the local wound a name and make distinct the very breach whereout hector’s great spirit flew
it would discredit the blest gods proud man to answer such a question
think’st thou to catch my life so pleasantly as to prenominate in nice conjecture where thou wilt hit me dead
wert thou an oracle to tell me so i’d not believe thee
henceforth guard thee well for i’ll not kill thee there nor there nor there but by the forge that stithied mars his helm i’ll kill thee everywhere yea o’er and o’er
you wisest grecians pardon me this brag
his insolence draws folly from my lips but i’ll endeavour deeds to match these words or may i never— ajax
do not chafe thee cousin and you achilles let these threats alone till accident or purpose bring you to’t
you may have every day enough of hector if you have stomach
the general state i fear can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
i pray you let us see you in the field we have had pelting wars since you refus’d the grecians’ cause
tomorrow do i meet thee fell as death tonight all friends
first all you peers of greece go to my tent there in the full convive we afterwards as hector’s leisure and your bounties shall concur together severally entreat him
beat loud the tambourines let the trumpets blow that this great soldier may his welcome know
exeunt all but troilus and ulysses
my lord ulysses tell me i beseech you in what place of the field doth calchas keep
at menelaus’ tent most princely troilus
there diomed doth feast with him tonight who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view on the fair cressid
shall i sweet lord be bound to you so much after we part from agamemnon’s tent to bring me thither
as gentle tell me of what honour was this cressida in troy
had she no lover there that wails her absence
o sir to such as boasting show their scars a mock is due
will you walk on my lord
she was belov’d she lov’d she is and doth but still sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth
i’ll heat his blood with greekish wine tonight which with my scimitar i’ll cool tomorrow
patroclus let us feast him to the height
how now thou core of envy
thou crusty batch of nature what’s the news
why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol of idiot worshippers here’s a letter for thee
why thou full dish of fool from troy
the surgeon’s box or the patient’s wound
prithee be silent boy i profit not by thy talk thou art said to be achilles’ male varlet
now the rotten diseases of the south the guts griping ruptures catarrhs loads o’ gravel in the back lethargies cold palsies raw eyes dirt rotten livers wheezing lungs bladders full of imposthume sciaticas lime kilns i’ th’ palm incurable bone ache and the rivelled fee simple of the tetter take and take again such preposterous discoveries
why thou damnable box of envy thou what meanest thou to curse thus
why no you ruinous butt you whoreson indistinguishable cur no
why art thou then exasperate thou idle immaterial skein of sleave silk thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigal’s purse thou
ah how the poor world is pestered with such water flies diminutives of nature
my sweet patroclus i am thwarted quite from my great purpose in tomorrow’s battle
here is a letter from queen hecuba a token from her daughter my fair love both taxing me and gaging me to keep an oath that i have sworn
fall greeks fail fame honour or go or stay my major vow lies here this i’ll obey
come come thersites help to trim my tent this night in banqueting must all be spent
with too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad but if with too much brain and too little blood they do i’ll be a curer of madmen
here’s agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails but he has not so much brain as ear wax and the goodly transformation of jupiter there his brother the bull the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds a thrifty shoeing horn in a chain at his brother’s leg to what form but that he is should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to
to an ass were nothing he is both ass and ox
to an ox were nothing he is both ox and ass
to be a dog a mule a cat a fitchook a toad a lizard an owl a puttock or a herring without a roe i would not care but to be menelaus i would conspire against destiny
ask me not what i would be if i were not thersites for i care not to be the louse of a lazar so i were not menelaus
enter hector troilus ajax agamemnon ulysses nestor menelaus and diomedes with lights
we go wrong we go wrong
no yonder ’tis there where we see the lights
here comes himself to guide you
welcome brave hector welcome princes all
so now fair prince of troy i bid good night ajax commands the guard to tend on you
thanks and good night to the greeks’ general
good night and welcome both at once to those that go or tarry
old nestor tarries and you too diomed keep hector company an hour or two
i cannot lord i have important business the tide whereof is now
aside to troilus follow his torch he goes to calchas’ tent i’ll keep you company
exit diomedes ulysses and troilus following achilles
that same diomed’s a false hearted rogue a most unjust knave i will no more trust him when he leers than i will a serpent when he hisses
he will spend his mouth and promise like brabbler the hound but when he performs astronomers foretell it it is prodigious there will come some change the sun borrows of the moon when diomed keeps his word
i will rather leave to see hector than not to dog him
they say he keeps a trojan drab and uses the traitor calchas’ tent
what are you up here ho
enter troilus and ulysses at a distance after them thersites
stand where the torch may not discover us
she will sing any man at first sight
and any man may sing her if he can take her cliff she’s noted
nay but do then and let your mind be coupled with your words
sweet honey greek tempt me no more to folly
come tell a pin you are a forsworn
what would you have me do
a juggling trick to be secretly open
what did you swear you would bestow on me
i prithee do not hold me to mine oath bid me do anything but that sweet greek
no no good night i’ll be your fool no more
you are moved prince let us depart i pray lest your displeasure should enlarge itself to wrathful terms
this place is dangerous the time right deadly i beseech you go
nay good my lord go off you flow to great distraction come my lord
i pray you stay by hell and all hell’s torments i will not speak a word
nay but you part in anger
by jove i will be patient
you shake my lord at something will you go
nay stay by jove i will not speak a word there is between my will and all offences a guard of patience
how the devil luxury with his fat rump and potato finger tickles these together
in faith i will la never trust me else
give me some token for the surety of it
fear me not my lord i will not be myself nor have cognition of what i feel
now the pledge now now now
i will be patient outwardly i will
you look upon that sleeve behold it well
he lov’d me—o false wench —give’t me again
it is no matter now i have’t again
i will not meet with you tomorrow night
i prithee diomed visit me no more
thy master now lies thinking on his bed of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove and gives memorial dainty kisses to it as i kiss thee
nay do not snatch it from me he that takes that doth take my heart withal
i had your heart before this follows it
you shall not have it diomed faith you shall not i’ll give you something else
come tell me whose it was
’twas one’s that lov’d me better than you will
but now you have it take it
by all diana’s waiting women yond and by herself i will not tell you whose
tomorrow will i wear it on my helm and grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it
wert thou the devil and wor’st it on thy horn it should be challeng’d
well well ’tis done ’tis past and yet it is not i will not keep my word
why then farewell thou never shalt mock diomed again
one cannot speak a word but it straight starts you
i do not like this fooling
nor i by pluto but that that likes not you pleases me best
one eye yet looks on thee but with my heart the other eye doth see
this fault in us i find the error of our eye directs our mind
what error leads must err o then conclude minds sway’d by eyes are full of turpitude
a proof of strength she could not publish more unless she said ‘my mind is now turn’d whore ’ ulysses
to make a recordation to my soul of every syllable that here was spoke
but if i tell how these two did co act shall i not lie in publishing a truth
sith yet there is a credence in my heart an esperance so obstinately strong that doth invert th’attest of eyes and ears as if those organs had deceptious functions created only to calumniate
why my negation hath no taste of madness
let it not be believ’d for womanhood
think we had mothers do not give advantage to stubborn critics apt without a theme for depravation to square the general sex by cressid’s rule
what hath she done prince that can soil our mothers
nothing at all unless that this were she
will he swagger himself out on’s own eyes
if beauty have a soul this is not she if souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies if sanctimony be the god’s delight if there be rule in unity itself this was not she
o madness of discourse that cause sets up with and against itself
where reason can revolt without perdition and loss assume all reason without revolt this is and is not cressid
within my soul there doth conduce a fight of this strange nature that a thing inseparate divides more wider than the sky and earth and yet the spacious breadth of this division admits no orifice for a point as subtle as ariachne’s broken woof to enter
strong as pluto’s gates cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
strong as heaven itself the bonds of heaven are slipp’d dissolv’d and loos’d and with another knot five finger tied the fractions of her faith orts of her love the fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics of her o’er eaten faith are given to diomed
may worthy troilus be half attach’d with that which here his passion doth express
ay greek and that shall be divulged well in characters as red as mars his heart inflam’d with venus
never did young man fancy with so eternal and so fix’d a soul
hark greek as much as i do cressid love so much by weight hate i her diomed
that sleeve is mine that he’ll bear on his helm were it a casque compos’d by vulcan’s skill my sword should bite it
not the dreadful spout which shipmen do the hurricano call constring’d in mass by the almighty sun shall dizzy with more clamour neptune’s ear in his descent than shall my prompted sword falling on diomed
he’ll tickle it for his concupy
let all untruths stand by thy stained name and they’ll seem glorious
o contain yourself your passion draws ears hither
i have been seeking you this hour my lord
hector by this is arming him in troy ajax your guard stays to conduct you home
and diomed stand fast and wear a castle on thy head
i’ll bring you to the gates
would i could meet that rogue diomed
i would croak like a raven i would bode i would bode
patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab
when was my lord so much ungently temper’d to stop his ears against admonishment
unarm unarm and do not fight today
you train me to offend you get you in
by all the everlasting gods i’ll go
my dreams will sure prove ominous to the day
here sister arm’d and bloody in intent
consort with me in loud and dear petition pursue we him on knees for i have dreamt of bloody turbulence and this whole night hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter
no notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother
the gods have heard me swear
the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows they are polluted off’rings more abhorr’d than spotted livers in the sacrifice
do not count it holy to hurt by being just
it is as lawful for we would give much to use violent thefts and rob in the behalf of charity
it is the purpose that makes strong the vow but vows to every purpose must not hold
mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
life every man holds dear but the dear man holds honour far more precious dear than life
cassandra call my father to persuade
no faith young troilus doff thy harness youth i am today i’ th’vein of chivalry
let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong and tempt not yet the brushes of the war
unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy i’ll stand today for thee and me and troy
brother you have a vice of mercy in you which better fits a lion than a man
good troilus chide me for it
when many times the captive grecian falls even in the fan and wind of your fair sword you bid them rise and live
for th’ love of all the gods let’s leave the hermit pity with our mother and when we have our armours buckled on the venom’d vengeance ride upon our swords spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth
troilus i would not have you fight today
not fate obedience nor the hand of mars beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire not priamus and hecuba on knees their eyes o’er galled with recourse of tears nor you my brother with your true sword drawn oppos’d to hinder me should stop my way but by my ruin
lay hold upon him priam hold him fast he is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay thou on him leaning and all troy on thee fall all together
thy wife hath dreamt thy mother hath had visions cassandra doth foresee and i myself am like a prophet suddenly enrapt to tell thee that this day is ominous
aeneas is a field and i do stand engag’d to many greeks even in the faith of valour to appear this morning to them
ay but thou shalt not go
i must not break my faith
you know me dutiful therefore dear sir let me not shame respect but give me leave to take that course by your consent and voice which you do here forbid me royal priam
o priam yield not to him
andromache i am offended with you
upon the love you bear me get you in
this foolish dreaming superstitious girl makes all these bodements
look how thy eye turns pale
look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents
hark how troy roars how hecuba cries out how poor andromache shrills her dolours forth behold distraction frenzy and amazement like witless antics one another meet and all cry ‘hector
thou dost thyself and all our troy deceive
you are amaz’d my liege at her exclaim
go in and cheer the town we’ll forth and fight do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night
the gods with safety stand about thee
proud diomed believe i come to lose my arm or win my sleeve
here’s a letter come from yond poor girl
a whoreson tisick a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles me and the foolish fortune of this girl and what one thing what another that i shall leave you one o’ these days and i have a rheum in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones that unless a man were curs’d i cannot tell what to think on’t
words words mere words no matter from the heart th’effect doth operate another way
go wind to wind there turn and change together
my love with words and errors still she feeds but edifies another with her deeds
the plain between troy and the grecian camp
now they are clapper clawing one another i’ll go look on
that dissembling abominable varlet diomed has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave’s sleeve of troy there in his helm
i would fain see them meet that that same young trojan ass that loves the whore there might send that greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeve less errand
o’ the other side the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old mouse eaten dry cheese nestor and that same dog fox ulysses is not prov’d worth a blackberry
they set me up in policy that mongrel cur ajax against that dog of as bad a kind achilles and now is the cur ajax prouder than the cur achilles and will not arm today whereupon the grecians begin to proclaim barbarism and policy grows into an ill opinion
fly not for shouldst thou take the river styx i would swim after
i do not fly but advantageous care withdrew me from the odds of multitude
hold thy whore grecian now for thy whore trojan
now the sleeve now the sleeve
art thou of blood and honour
no no i am a rascal a scurvy railing knave a very filthy rogue
god a mercy that thou wilt believe me but a plague break thy neck for frighting me
what’s become of the wenching rogues
i think they have swallowed one another
i would laugh at that miracle
yet in a sort lechery eats itself
scene v another part of the plain
go go my servant take thou troilus’ horse present the fair steed to my lady cressid
fellow commend my service to her beauty tell her i have chastis’d the amorous trojan and am her knight by proof
the fierce polydamas hath beat down menon bastard margarelon hath doreus prisoner and stands colossus wise waving his beam upon the pashed corses of the kings epistrophus and cedius
polixenes is slain amphimacus and thoas deadly hurt patroclus ta’en or slain and palamedes sore hurt and bruis’d
the dreadful sagittary appals our numbers
haste we diomed to reinforcement or we perish all
go bear patroclus’ body to achilles and bid the snail pac’d ajax arm for shame
there is a thousand hectors in the field now here he fights on galathe his horse and there lacks work anon he’s there afoot and there they fly or die like scaled sculls before the belching whale then is he yonder and there the strawy greeks ripe for his edge fall down before him like the mower’s swath
here there and everywhere he leaves and takes dexterity so obeying appetite that what he will he does and does so much that proof is call’d impossibility
great achilles is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance
patroclus’ wounds have rous’d his drowsy blood together with his mangled myrmidons that noseless handless hack’d and chipp’d come to him crying on hector
ajax hath lost a friend and foams at mouth and he is arm’d and at it roaring for troilus who hath done today mad and fantastic execution engaging and redeeming of himself with such a careless force and forceless care as if that lust in very spite of cunning bade him win all
come come thou boy queller show thy face know what it is to meet achilles angry
troilus thou coward troilus show thy head
were i the general thou shouldst have my office ere that correction
turn thy false face thou traitor and pay thy life thou owest me for my horse
come both you cogging greeks have at you both
o well fought my youngest brother
i do disdain thy courtesy proud trojan
be happy that my arms are out of use my rest and negligence befriend thee now but thou anon shalt hear of me again till when go seek thy fortune
i would have been much more a fresher man had i expected thee
no by the flame of yonder glorious heaven he shall not carry him i’ll be ta’en too or bring him off
fate hear me what i say i reck not though thou end my life today
stand stand thou greek thou art a goodly mark
i like thy armour well i’ll frush it and unlock the rivets all but i’ll be master of it
why then fly on i’ll hunt thee for thy hide
come here about me you my myrmidons mark what i say
attend me where i wheel strike not a stroke but keep yourselves in breath and when i have the bloody hector found empale him with your weapons round about in fellest manner execute your arms
follow me sirs and my proceedings eye
it is decreed hector the great must die
enter menelaus and paris fighting then thersites
the cuckold and the cuckold maker are at it
i am a bastard too i love bastards
i am a bastard begot bastard instructed bastard in mind bastard in valour in everything illegitimate
one bear will not bite another and wherefore should one bastard
take heed the quarrel’s most ominous to us if the son of a whore fight for a whore he tempts judgement
most putrified core so fair without thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life
now is my day’s work done i’ll take my breath rest sword thou hast thy fill of blood and death
look hector how the sun begins to set how ugly night comes breathing at his heels even with the vail and dark’ning of the sun to close the day up hector’s life is done
i am unarm’d forego this vantage greek
strike fellows strike this is the man i seek
now troy sink down here lies thy heart thy sinews and thy bone
on myrmidons and cry you all amain ‘achilles hath the mighty hector slain ’ a retreat sounded
a retire upon our grecian part
the trojan trumpets sound the like my lord
the dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth and stickler like the armies separates
my half supp’d sword that frankly would have fed pleas’d with this dainty bait thus goes to bed
come tie his body to my horse’s tail along the field i will the trojan trail
enter agamemnon ajax menelaus nestor diomedes and the rest marching
the bruit is hector’s slain and by achilles
if it be so yet bragless let it be great hector was as good a man as he
let one be sent to pray achilles see us at our tent
if in his death the gods have us befriended great troy is ours and our sharp wars are ended
enter aeneas paris antenor and deiphobus
yet are we masters of the field
never go home here starve we out the night
he’s dead and at the murderer’s horse’s tail in beastly sort dragg’d through the shameful field
frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed
sit gods upon your thrones and smile at troy
i say at once let your brief plagues be mercy and linger not our sure destructions on
my lord you do discomfort all the host
you understand me not that tell me so
i do not speak of flight of fear of death but dare all imminence that gods and men address their dangers in
who shall tell priam so or hecuba
let him that will a screech owl aye be call’d go in to troy and say there ‘hector’s dead ’ there is a word will priam turn to stone make wells and niobes of the maids and wives cold statues of the youth and in a word scare troy out of itself
but march away hector is dead there is no more to say
you vile abominable tents thus proudly pight upon our phrygian plains let titan rise as early as he dare i’ll through and through you
and thou great siz’d coward no space of earth shall sunder our two hates i’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still that mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts
strike a free march to troy
with comfort go hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe
ignominy and shame pursue thy life and live aye with thy name
a goodly medicine for my aching bones
thus is the poor agent despis’d
o traitors and bawds how earnestly are you set a work and how ill requited
why should our endeavour be so lov’d and the performance so loathed
let me see— full merrily the humble bee doth sing till he hath lost his honey and his sting and being once subdu’d in armed trail sweet honey and sweet notes together fail
good traders in the flesh set this in your painted cloths
as many as be here of pandar’s hall your eyes half out weep out at pandar’s fall or if you cannot weep yet give some groans though not for me yet for your aching bones
brethren and sisters of the hold door trade some two months hence my will shall here be made
it should be now but that my fear is this some galled goose of winchester would hiss
till then i’ll sweat and seek about for eases and at that time bequeath you my diseases

enter orsino duke of illyria curio and other lords musicians attending
if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die
that strain again it had a dying fall o it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odour
enough no more ’tis not so sweet now as it was before
o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou that notwithstanding thy capacity receiveth as the sea nought enters there of what validity and pitch soever but falls into abatement and low price even in a minute
so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical
will you go hunt my lord
why so i do the noblest that i have
o when mine eyes did see olivia first methought she purg’d the air of pestilence that instant was i turn’d into a hart and my desires like fell and cruel hounds e’er since pursue me
so please my lord i might not be admitted but from her handmaid do return this answer the element itself till seven years’ heat shall not behold her face at ample view but like a cloistress she will veiled walk and water once a day her chamber round with eye offending brine all this to season a brother’s dead love which she would keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance
o she that hath a heart of that fine frame to pay this debt of love but to a brother how will she love when the rich golden shaft hath kill’d the flock of all affections else that live in her when liver brain and heart these sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill’d her sweet perfections with one self king
away before me to sweet beds of flowers love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers
enter viola a captain and sailors
and what should i do in illyria
my brother he is in elysium
it is perchance that you yourself were sav’d
and so perchance may he be
true madam and to comfort you with chance assure yourself after our ship did split when you and those poor number sav’d with you hung on our driving boat i saw your brother most provident in peril bind himself courage and hope both teaching him the practice to a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea where like arion on the dolphin’s back i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves so long as i could see
mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope whereto thy speech serves for authority the like of him
ay madam well for i was bred and born not three hours’ travel from this very place
a noble duke in nature as in name
i have heard my father name him
and so is now or was so very late for but a month ago i went from hence and then ’twas fresh in murmur as you know what great ones do the less will prattle of that he did seek the love of fair olivia
a virtuous maid the daughter of a count that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her in the protection of his son her brother who shortly also died for whose dear love they say she hath abjur’d the company and sight of men
o that i served that lady and might not be delivered to the world till i had made mine own occasion mellow what my estate is
that were hard to compass because she will admit no kind of suit no not the duke’s
there is a fair behaviour in thee captain and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution yet of thee i will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character
i pray thee and i’ll pay thee bounteously conceal me what i am and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent
i’ll serve this duke thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him
it may be worth thy pains for i can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service
what else may hap to time i will commit only shape thou thy silence to my wit
be you his eunuch and your mute i’ll be when my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
what a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus
i am sure care’s an enemy to life
by my troth sir toby you must come in earlier o’ nights your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours
why let her except before excepted
ay but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order
i’ll confine myself no finer than i am
these clothes are good enough to drink in and so be these boots too and they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps
that quaffing and drinking will undo you i heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer
he’s as tall a man as any’s in illyria
why he has three thousand ducats a year
ay but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats
he’s a very fool and a prodigal
he plays o’ the viol de gamboys and speaks three or four languages word for word without book and hath all the good gifts of nature
he hath indeed almost natural for besides that he’s a fool he’s a great quarreller and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave
by this hand they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him
they that add moreover he’s drunk nightly in your company
with drinking healths to my niece i’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in illyria
he’s a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ the toe like a parish top
castiliano vulgo for here comes sir andrew agueface
good mistress accost i desire better acquaintance
good mistress mary accost — sir toby
you mistake knight accost is front her board her woo her assail her
by my troth i would not undertake her in this company
is that the meaning of accost
and thou let part so sir andrew would thou mightst never draw sword again
and you part so mistress i would i might never draw sword again
fair lady do you think you have fools in hand
sir i have not you by the hand
marry but you shall have and here’s my hand
i pray you bring your hand to th’ buttery bar and let it drink
why i think so i am not such an ass but i can keep my hand dry
ay sir i have them at my fingers’ ends marry now i let go your hand i am barren
o knight thou lack’st a cup of canary when did i see thee so put down
never in your life i think unless you see canary put me down
methinks sometimes i have no more wit than a christian or an ordinary man has but i am a great eater of beef and i believe that does harm to my wit
and i thought that i’d forswear it
i’ll ride home tomorrow sir toby
what is pourquoy do or not do
i would i had bestowed that time in the tongues that i have in fencing dancing and bear baiting
o had i but followed the arts
then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair
why would that have mended my hair
past question for thou seest it will not curl by nature
but it becomes me well enough does’t not
excellent it hangs like flax on a distaff and i hope to see a houswife take thee between her legs and spin it off
faith i’ll home tomorrow sir toby your niece will not be seen or if she be it’s four to one she’ll none of me the count himself here hard by woos her
she’ll none o’ the count she’ll not match above her degree neither in estate years nor wit i have heard her swear’t
i am a fellow o’ the strangest mind i’ the world i delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether
art thou good at these kick shawses knight
as any man in illyria whatsoever he be under the degree of my betters and yet i will not compare with an old man
what is thy excellence in a galliard knight
faith i can cut a caper
and i can cut the mutton to’t
and i think i have the back trick simply as strong as any man in illyria
wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em
are they like to take dust like mistress mall’s picture
why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto
my very walk should be a jig i would not so much as make water but in a sink a pace
is it a world to hide virtues in
i did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard
ay ’tis strong and it does indifferent well in a dam’d colour’d stock
shall we set about some revels
were we not born under taurus
no sir it is legs and thighs
a room in the duke’s palace
enter valentine and viola in man’s attire
if the duke continue these favours towards you cesario you are like to be much advanced he hath known you but three days and already you are no stranger
you either fear his humour or my negligence that you call in question the continuance of his love
is he inconstant sir in his favours
on your attendance my lord here
stand you awhile aloof —cesario thou know’st no less but all i have unclasp’d to thee the book even of my secret soul
therefore good youth address thy gait unto her be not denied access stand at her doors and tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow till thou have audience
sure my noble lord if she be so abandon’d to her sorrow as it is spoke she never will admit me
be clamorous and leap all civil bounds rather than make unprofited return
say i do speak with her my lord what then
o then unfold the passion of my love surprise her with discourse of my dear faith it shall become thee well to act my woes she will attend it better in thy youth than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect
i think not so my lord
dear lad believe it for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man diana’s lip is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe is as the maiden’s organ shrill and sound and all is semblative a woman’s part
i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair
some four or five attend him all if you will for i myself am best when least in company
prosper well in this and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine
i’ll do my best to woo your lady
whoe’er i woo myself would be his wife
exeunt scene v a room in olivia’s house
nay either tell me where thou hast been or i will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse my lady will hang thee for thy absence
let her hang me he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours
he shall see none to fear
i can tell thee where that saying was born of i fear no colours
in the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery
well god give them wisdom that have it and those that are fools let them use their talents
yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you
many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and for turning away let summer bear it out
not so neither but i am resolved on two points
that if one break the other will hold or if both break your gaskins fall
apt in good faith very apt
well go thy way if sir toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a piece of eve’s flesh as any in illyria
peace you rogue no more o’ that
here comes my lady make your excuse wisely you were best
wit and’t be thy will put me into good fooling
those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools and i that am sure i lack thee may pass for a wise man
better a witty fool than a foolish wit
go to y’are a dry fool i’ll no more of you
two faults madonna that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink then is the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if he cannot let the botcher mend him
anything that’s mended is but patched virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue
if that this simple syllogism will serve so if it will not what remedy
as there is no true cuckold but calamity so beauty’s a flower
the lady bade take away the fool therefore i say again take her away
sir i bade them take away you
lady cucullus non facit monachum that’s as much to say i wear not motley in my brain
good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool
i must catechize you for it madonna
good my mouse of virtue answer me
well sir for want of other idleness i’ll ’bide your proof
good fool for my brother’s death
i think his soul is in hell madonna
i know his soul is in heaven fool
the more fool you madonna to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven
what think you of this fool malvolio
yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him
infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool
god send you sir a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly
sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool
how say you to that malvolio
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone
look you now he’s out of his guard already unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagged
i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools’ zanies
o you are sick of self love malvolio and taste with a distempered appetite
to be generous guiltless and of free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets
there is no slander in an allowed fool though he do nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet man though he do nothing but reprove
now mercury endue thee with leasing for thou speak’st well of fools
madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you
from the count orsino is it
i know not madam ’tis a fair young man and well attended
who of my people hold him in delay
fetch him off i pray you he speaks nothing but madman
if it be a suit from the count i am sick or not at home
what you will to dismiss it
exit malvolio now you see sir how your fooling grows old and people dislike it
thou hast spoke for us madonna as if thy eldest son should be a fool whose skull jove cram with brains for here he comes one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater
what is he at the gate cousin
a plague o’ these pickle herrings
cousin cousin how have you come so early by this lethargy
let him be the devil an he will i care not give me faith say i
what’s a drunken man like fool
like a drowned man a fool and a madman one draught above heat makes him a fool the second mads him and a third drowns him
go thou and seek the coroner and let him sit o’ my coz for he’s in the third degree of drink he’s drowned
he is but mad yet madonna and the fool shall look to the madman
madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with you
i told him you were sick he takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you
i told him you were asleep he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you
what is to be said to him lady
tell him he shall not speak with me
has been told so and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post and be the supporter of a bench but he’ll speak with you
what kind o’ man is he
of very ill manner he’ll speak with you will you or no
of what personage and years is he
not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy as a squash is before ’tis a peascod or a codling when ’tis almost an apple
’tis with him in standing water between boy and man
he is very well favoured and he speaks very shrewishly
one would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him
give me my veil come throw it o’er my face
we’ll once more hear orsino’s embassy
the honourable lady of the house which is she
speak to me i shall answer for her
most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beauty —i pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for i never saw her
i would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penned i have taken great pains to con it
good beauties let me sustain no scorn i am very comptible even to the least sinister usage
i can say little more than i have studied and that question’s out of my part
good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that i may proceed in my speech
no my profound heart and yet by the very fangs of malice i swear i am not that i play
are you the lady of the house
if i do not usurp myself i am
most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve
but this is from my commission
i will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message
come to what is important in’t i forgive you the praise
alas i took great pains to study it and ’tis poetical
it is the more like to be feigned i pray you keep it in
i heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you
if you be mad be gone if you have reason be brief ’tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue
no good swabber i am to hull here a little longer
some mollification for your giant sweet lady
sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when the courtesy of it is so fearful
i bring no overture of war no taxation of homage i hold the olive in my hand my words are as full of peace as matter
the rudeness that hath appeared in me have i learned from my entertainment
what i am and what i would are as secret as maidenhead to your ears divinity to any other’s profanation
give us the place alone we will hear this divinity
exit maria now sir what is your text
a comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it
in what chapter of his bosom
to answer by the method in the first of his heart
o i have read it it is heresy
have you no more to say
good madam let me see your face
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face
you are now out of your text but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture
unveiling look you sir such a one i was this present
excellently done if god did all
’tis in grain sir ’twill endure wind and weather
’tis beauty truly blent whose red and white nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on
lady you are the cruel’st she alive if you will lead these graces to the grave and leave the world no copy
o sir i will not be so hard hearted i will give out divers schedules of my beauty
it shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my will as item two lips indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to them item one neck one chin and so forth
were you sent hither to praise me
i see you what you are you are too proud but if you were the devil you are fair
my lord and master loves you
o such love could be but recompens’d though you were crown’d the nonpareil of beauty
with adorations fertile tears with groans that thunder love with sighs of fire
your lord does know my mind i cannot love him yet i suppose him virtuous know him noble of great estate of fresh and stainless youth in voices well divulg’d free learn’d and valiant and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person
but yet i cannot love him
he might have took his answer long ago
if i did love you in my master’s flame with such a suff’ring such a deadly life in your denial i would find no sense i would not understand it
make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night hallow your name to the reverberate hills and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out olivia
o you should not rest between the elements of air and earth but you should pity me
above my fortunes yet my state is well i am a gentleman
get you to your lord i cannot love him let him send no more unless perchance you come to me again to tell me how he takes it
fare you well i thank you for your pains spend this for me
i am no fee’d post lady keep your purse my master not myself lacks recompense
love make his heart of flint that you shall love and let your fervour like my master’s be plac’d in contempt
‘above my fortunes yet my state is well i am a gentleman ’ i’ll be sworn thou art thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit do give thee five fold blazon
unless the master were the man
even so quickly may one catch the plague
methinks i feel this youth’s perfections with an invisible and subtle stealth to creep in at mine eyes
run after that same peevish messenger the county’s man he left this ring behind him would i or not tell him i’ll none of it
desire him not to flatter with his lord nor hold him up with hopes i am not for him
if that the youth will come this way tomorrow i’ll give him reasons for’t
i do i know not what and fear to find mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind
fate show thy force ourselves we do not owe
what is decreed must be and be this so
nor will you not that i go with you
by your patience no my stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore i shall crave of you your leave that i may bear my evils alone
it were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
let me know of you whither you are bound
no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in
therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself
you must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian which i called roderigo my father was that sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard of
he left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour
if the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended
but you sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned
a lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful
but though i could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair
she is drowned already sir with salt water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more
pardon me sir your bad entertainment
o good antonio forgive me your trouble
if you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant
if you will not undo what you have done that is kill him whom you have recovered desire it not
fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me
i am bound to the count orsino’s court farewell
the gentleness of all the gods go with thee
i have many enemies in orsino’s court else would i very shortly see thee there but come what may i do adore thee so that danger shall seem sport and i will go
enter viola malvolio at several doors
were you not even now with the countess olivia
even now sir on a moderate pace i have since arrived but hither
she returns this ring to you sir you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself
she adds moreover that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him
and one thing more that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lord’s taking of this
she took the ring of me i’ll none of it
come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned
if it be worth stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be it his that finds it
i left no ring with her what means this lady
fortune forbid my outside have not charm’d her
she made good view of me indeed so much that methought her eyes had lost her tongue for she did speak in starts distractedly
she loves me sure the cunning of her passion invites me in this churlish messenger
i am the man if it be so as ’tis poor lady she were better love a dream
disguise i see thou art a wickedness wherein the pregnant enemy does much
how easy is it for the proper false in women’s waxen hearts to set their forms
alas our frailty is the cause not we for such as we are made of such we be
my master loves her dearly and i poor monster fond as much on him and she mistaken seems to dote on me
as i am man my state is desperate for my master’s love as i am woman now alas the day
what thriftless sighs shall poor olivia breathe
o time thou must untangle this not i it is too hard a knot for me t’untie
enter sir toby and sir andrew
approach sir andrew not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes and diluculo surgere thou know’st
nay by my troth i know not but i know to be up late is to be up late
a false conclusion i hate it as an unfilled can
to be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes
does not our lives consist of the four elements
faith so they say but i think it rather consists of eating and drinking
th’art a scholar let us therefore eat and drink
here comes the fool i’ faith
did you never see the picture of “we three”
by my troth the fool has an excellent breast
i had rather than forty shillings i had such a leg and so sweet a breath to sing as the fool has
in sooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spok’st of pigrogromitus of the vapians passing the equinoctial of queubus ’twas very good i’ faith
i sent thee sixpence for thy leman
i did impeticos thy gratillity for malvolio’s nose is no whipstock
my lady has a white hand and the myrmidons are no bottle ale houses
why this is the best fooling when all is done
come on there is sixpence for you
there’s a testril of me too if one knight give a— clown
would you have a love song or a song of good life
a love song a love song
i care not for good life
sings o mistress mine where are you roaming
o stay and hear your true love’s coming that can sing both high and low
journeys end in lovers meeting every wise man’s son doth know sir andrew
’tis not hereafter present mirth hath present laughter
what’s to come is still unsure
in delay there lies no plenty then come kiss me sweet and twenty
youth’s a stuff will not endure sir andrew
a mellifluous voice as i am true knight
very sweet and contagious i’ faith
to hear by the nose it is dulcet in contagion
but shall we make the welkin dance indeed
shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver
and you love me let’s do’t i am dog at a catch
by’r lady sir and some dogs will catch well
let our catch be “thou knave ” clown
“hold thy peace thou knave” knight
i shall be constrain’d in’t to call thee knave knight
’tis not the first time i have constrained one to call me knave
begin fool it begins “hold thy peace ” clown
i shall never begin if i hold my peace
what a caterwauling do you keep here
if my lady have not called up her steward malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors never trust me
my lady’s a cataian we are politicians malvolio’s a peg a ramsey and sings three merry men be we am not i consanguineous
am i not of her blood
there dwelt a man in babylon lady lady clown
beshrew me the knight’s in admirable fooling
ay he does well enough if he be disposed and so do i too he does it with a better grace but i do it more natural
sings o’ the twelfth day of december— maria
for the love o’ god peace
have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night
do ye make an ale house of my lady’s house that ye squeak out your coziers’ catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice
is there no respect of place persons nor time in you
we did keep time sir in our catches
sir toby i must be round with you
my lady bade me tell you that though she harbours you as her kinsman she’s nothing allied to your disorders
if you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours you are welcome to the house if not and it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell
sings farewell dear heart since i must needs be gone maria
sings his eyes do show his days are almost done malvolio
sings but i will never die clown
sings sir toby there you lie malvolio
this is much credit to you
sings shall i bid him go clown
sings what and if you do sir toby
sings shall i bid him go and spare not clown
sings o no no no no you dare not sir toby
art any more than a steward
dost thou think because thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale
yes by saint anne and ginger shall be hot i’ the mouth too
go sir rub your chain with crumbs
mistress mary if you prized my lady’s favour at anything more than contempt you would not give means for this uncivil rule she shall know of it by this hand
’twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a hungry to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him
i’ll write thee a challenge or i’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth
sweet sir toby be patient for tonight
since the youth of the count’s was today with my lady she is much out of quiet
for monsieur malvolio let me alone with him
if i do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not think i have wit enough to lie straight in my bed
i know i can do it
possess us possess us tell us something of him
marry sir sometimes he is a kind of puritan
o if i thought that i’d beat him like a dog
i have no exquisite reason for’t but i have reason good enough
the devil a puritan that he is or anything constantly but a time pleaser an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself so crammed as he thinks with excellencies that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him
and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work
i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated
i can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands
i have’t in my nose too
he shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that she is in love with him
my purpose is indeed a horse of that colour
and your horse now would make him an ass
i know my physic will work with him
i will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter
for this night to bed and dream on the event
before me she’s a good wench
she’s a beagle true bred and one that adores me
thou hadst need send for more money
if i cannot recover your niece i am a foul way out
send for money knight if thou hast her not i’ th’ end call me cut
if i do not never trust me take it how you will
come come i’ll go burn some sack ’tis too late to go to bed now
a room in the duke’s palace
enter duke viola curio and others
now good cesario but that piece of song that old and antique song we heard last night methought it did relieve my passion much more than light airs and recollected terms of these most brisk and giddy paced times
he is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
feste the jester my lord a fool that the lady olivia’s father took much delight in
seek him out and play the tune the while
if ever thou shalt love in the sweet pangs of it remember me for such as i am all true lovers are unstaid and skittish in all motions else save in the constant image of the creature that is belov’d
how dost thou like this tune
it gives a very echo to the seat where love is throned
my life upon’t young though thou art thine eye hath stayed upon some favour that it loves
she is not worth thee then
let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him so sways she level in her husband’s heart
for boy however we do praise ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and worn than women’s are
i think it well my lord
then let thy love be younger than thyself or thy affection cannot hold the bent for women are as roses whose fair flower being once display’d doth fall that very hour
and so they are alas that they are so to die even when they to perfection grow
o fellow come the song we had last night
mark it cesario it is old and plain the spinsters and the knitters in the sun and the free maids that weave their thread with bones do use to chant it it is silly sooth and dallies with the innocence of love like the old age
and in sad cypress let me be laid
fly away fly away breath i am slain by a fair cruel maid
my shroud of white stuck all with yew o prepare it
my part of death no one so true did share it not a flower not a flower sweet on my black coffin let there be strown not a friend not a friend greet my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown a thousand thousand sighs to save lay me o where sad true lover never find my grave to weep there duke
no pains sir i take pleasure in singing sir
truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
give me now leave to leave thee
now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal
i would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing
let all the rest give place
exeunt curio and attendants once more cesario get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
tell her my love more noble than the world prizes not quantity of dirty lands the parts that fortune hath bestow’d upon her tell her i hold as giddily as fortune but ’tis that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul
but if she cannot love you sir
say that some lady as perhaps there is hath for your love as great a pang of heart as you have for olivia you cannot love her you tell her so
must she not then be answer’d
there is no woman’s sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart no woman’s heart so big to hold so much they lack retention
alas their love may be called appetite no motion of the liver but the palate that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt but mine is all as hungry as the sea and can digest as much
make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia
too well what love women to men may owe
in faith they are as true of heart as we
my father had a daughter loved a man as it might be perhaps were i a woman i should your lordship
she never told her love but let concealment like a worm i’ th’ bud feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief
we men may say more swear more but indeed our shows are more than will for still we prove much in our vows but little in our love
but died thy sister of her love my boy
i am all the daughters of my father’s house and all the brothers too and yet i know not
sir shall i to this lady
give her this jewel say my love can give no place bide no denay
enter sir toby sir andrew and fabian
if i lose a scruple of this sport let me be boiled to death with melancholy
wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep biter come by some notable shame
you know he brought me out o’ favour with my lady about a bear baiting here
to anger him we’ll have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue shall we not sir andrew
and we do not it is pity of our lives
how now my metal of india
get ye all three into the box tree
malvolio’s coming down this walk he has been yonder i’ the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half hour observe him for the love of mockery for i know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him
close in the name of jesting
the men hide themselves lie thou there throws down a letter for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling
’tis but fortune all is fortune
maria once told me she did affect me and i have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion
besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her
contemplation makes a rare turkey cock of him how he jets under his advanced plumes
’slight i could so beat the rogue
the lady of the strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe
now he’s deeply in look how imagination blows him
having been three months married to her sitting in my state— sir toby
o for a stone bow to hit him in the eye
calling my officers about me in my branched velvet gown having come from a day bed where i have left olivia sleeping
and then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them i know my place as i would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman toby
seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him
i frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with some rich jewel
toby approaches curtsies there to me— sir toby
though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace
i extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control— sir toby
and does not toby take you a blow o’ the lips then
saying ‘cousin toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech—’ sir toby
‘you must amend your drunkenness ’ sir toby
nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot
‘besides you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight—’ sir andrew
‘one sir andrew ’ sir andrew
i knew ’twas i for many do call me fool
taking up the letter what employment have we here
now is the woodcock near the gin
and the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him
by my life this is my lady’s hand these be her very c’s her u’s and her t’s and thus makes she her great p’s
it is in contempt of question her hand
her c’s her u’s and her t’s
reads to the unknown beloved this and my good wishes her very phrases
and the impressure her lucrece with which she uses to seal ’tis my lady
this wins him liver and all
reads jove knows i love but who
lips do not move no man must know ‘no man must know ’ what follows
‘no man must know ’—if this should be thee malvolio
i may command where i adore but silence like a lucrece knife with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore m o a i
doth sway my life ’—nay but first let me see let me see let me see
what dish o’ poison has she dressed him
and with what wing the staniel checks at it
‘i may command where i adore ’ why she may command me i serve her she is my lady
why this is evident to any formal capacity
there is no obstruction in this
and the end—what should that alphabetical position portend
if i could make that resemble something in me
‘m o a i ’— sir toby
o ay make up that —he is now at a cold scent
sowter will cry upon’t for all this though it be as rank as a fox
‘m’—malvolio ‘m ’ why that begins my name
did not i say he would work it out
the cur is excellent at faults
‘m’—but then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation ‘a’ should follow but ‘o’ does
and ‘o’ shall end i hope
ay or i’ll cudgel him and make him cry ‘o ’ malvolio
ay and you had any eye behind you you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you
‘m o a i ’ this simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name
reads if this fall into thy hand revolve
in my stars i am above thee but be not afraid of greatness
some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon ’em
thy fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them
and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh
be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants
let thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity
she thus advises thee that sighs for thee
remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross gartered
go to thou art made if thou desir’st to be so
if not let me see thee a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch fortune’s fingers
she that would alter services with thee the fortunate unhappy daylight and champian discovers not more
i will be proud i will read politic authors i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross acquaintance i will be point device the very man
i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me
she did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being cross gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking
i thank my stars i am happy
i will be strange stout in yellow stockings and cross gartered even with the swiftness of putting on
jove and my stars be praised —here is yet a postscript
reads thou canst not choose but know who i am
if thou entertain’st my love let it appear in thy smiling thy smiles become thee well
therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet i prithee jove i thank thee
i will smile i will do everything that thou wilt have me
i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the sophy
i could marry this wench for this device
and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
here comes my noble gull catcher
wilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck
shall i play my freedom at tray trip and become thy bond slave
why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad
nay but say true does it work upon him
like aqua vitae with a midwife
if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings and ’tis a colour she abhors and cross gartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt
if you will see it follow me
to the gates of tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
enter viola and clown with a tabor
save thee friend and thy music
dost thou live by thy tabor
no sir i live by the church
i do live by the church for i do live at my house and my house doth stand by the church
so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church
a sentence is but a chev’ril glove to a good wit
how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward
nay that’s certain they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton
i would therefore my sister had had no name sir
why sir her name’s a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton
but indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them
troth sir i can yield you none without words and words are grown so false i am loath to prove reason with them
i warrant thou art a merry fellow and car’st for nothing
not so sir i do care for something
but in my conscience sir i do not care for you
if that be to care for nothing sir i would it would make you invisible
art not thou the lady olivia’s fool
no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly
she will keep no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings the husband’s the bigger
i am indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words
i saw thee late at the count orsino’s
foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun it shines everywhere
i would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress
i think i saw your wisdom there
nay and thou pass upon me i’ll no more with thee
now jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
by my troth i’ll tell thee i am almost sick for one though i would not have it grow on my chin
would not a pair of these have bred sir
yes being kept together and put to use
i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring a cressida to this troilus
i understand you sir ’tis well begged
the matter i hope is not great sir begging but a beggar cressida was a beggar
i will conster to them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of my welkin
i might say “element” but the word is overworn
this fellow is wise enough to play the fool and to do that well craves a kind of wit he must observe their mood on whom he jests the quality of persons and the time and like the haggard check at every feather that comes before his eye
this is a practice as full of labour as a wise man’s art for folly that he wisely shows is fit but wise men folly fall’n quite taint their wit
enter sir toby and sir andrew
et vous aussi votre serviteur sir andrew
i hope sir you are and i am yours
my niece is desirous you should enter if your trade be to her
i am bound to your niece sir i mean she is the list of my voyage
taste your legs sir put them to motion
my legs do better understand me sir than i understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs
i mean to go sir to enter
i will answer you with gait and entrance but we are prevented
most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain odours on you
my matter hath no voice lady but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed car
‘odours ’ ‘pregnant ’ and ‘vouchsafed ’—i’ll get ’em all three ready
let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing
exeunt sir toby sir andrew and maria give me your hand sir
my duty madam and most humble service
cesario is your servant’s name fair princess
’twas never merry world since lowly feigning was call’d compliment y’are servant to the count orsino youth
and he is yours and his must needs be yours
your servant’s servant is your servant madam
for him i think not on him for his thoughts would they were blanks rather than fill’d with me
madam i come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf
o by your leave i pray you
i bade you never speak again of him
but would you undertake another suit i had rather hear you to solicit that than music from the spheres
i did send after the last enchantment you did here a ring in chase of you
so did i abuse myself my servant and i fear me you
under your hard construction must i sit to force that on you in a shameful cunning which you knew none of yours
have you not set mine honour at the stake and baited it with all th’ unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think
to one of your receiving enough is shown
a cypress not a bosom hides my heart so let me hear you speak
no not a grize for ’tis a vulgar proof that very oft we pity enemies
why then methinks ’tis time to smile again
o world how apt the poor are to be proud
if one should be a prey how much the better to fall before the lion than the wolf
clock strikes the clock upbraids me with the waste of time
be not afraid good youth i will not have you
and yet when wit and youth is come to harvest your wife is like to reap a proper man
there lies your way due west
grace and good disposition attend your ladyship
you’ll nothing madam to my lord by me
stay i prithee tell me what thou think’st of me
that you do think you are not what you are
if i think so i think the same of you
then think you right i am not what i am
i would you were as i would have you be
would it be better madam than i am
i wish it might for now i am your fool
o what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the contempt and anger of his lip
a murd’rous guilt shows not itself more soon than love that would seem hid
cesario by the roses of the spring by maidhood honour truth and everything i love thee so that maugre all thy pride nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
do not extort thy reasons from this clause for that i woo thou therefore hast no cause but rather reason thus with reason fetter love sought is good but given unsought is better
by innocence i swear and by my youth i have one heart one bosom and one truth and that no woman has nor never none shall mistress be of it save i alone
and so adieu good madam never more will i my master’s tears to you deplore
yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move that heart which now abhors to like his love
enter sir toby sir andrew and fabian
no faith i’ll not stay a jot longer
thy reason dear venom give thy reason
you must needs yield your reason sir andrew
marry i saw your niece do more favours to the count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me i saw’t i’ th’ orchard
did she see thee the while old boy
as plain as i see you now
this was a great argument of love in her toward you
will you make an ass o’ me
i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason
and they have been grand jurymen since before noah was a sailor
she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
you should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests fire new from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness
this was looked for at your hand and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion where you will hang like an icicle on dutchman’s beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy
and’t be any way it must be with valour for policy i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a politician
why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour
challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him
hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valour
there is no way but this sir andrew
will either of you bear me a challenge to him
go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention
taunt him with the licence of ink
if thou ‘thou’st’ him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of ware in england set ’em down
let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goose pen no matter
we’ll call thee at the cubiculo
this is a dear manikin to you sir toby
i have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or so
we shall have a rare letter from him but you’ll not deliver it
and by all means stir on the youth to an answer
i think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together
for andrew if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea i’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy
and his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty
look where the youngest wren of nine comes
if you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches follow me
yond gull malvolio is turned heathen a very renegado for there is no christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness
most villainously like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church
i have dogged him like his murderer
he does obey every point of the letter that i dropped to betray him
he does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the indies
you have not seen such a thing as ’tis
i can hardly forbear hurling things at him
i know my lady will strike him
if she do he’ll smile and take’t for a great favour
come bring us bring us where he is
i would not by my will have troubled you but since you make your pleasure of your pains i will no further chide you
i could not stay behind you my desire more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth and not all love to see you though so much as might have drawn one to a longer voyage but jealousy what might befall your travel being skilless in these parts which to a stranger unguided and unfriended often prove rough and unhospitable
my willing love the rather by these arguments of fear set forth in your pursuit
my kind antonio i can no other answer make but thanks and thanks and ever thanks and oft good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay
but were my worth as is my conscience firm you should find better dealing
shall we go see the relics of this town
tomorrow sir best first go see your lodging
i am not weary and ’tis long to night i pray you let us satisfy our eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that do renown this city
i do not without danger walk these streets
once in a sea fight ’gainst the count his galleys i did some service of such note indeed that were i ta’en here it would scarce be answer’d
belike you slew great number of his people
th’ offence is not of such a bloody nature albeit the quality of the time and quarrel might well have given us bloody argument
it might have since been answered in repaying what we took from them which for traffic’s sake most of our city did
only myself stood out for which if i be lapsed in this place i shall pay dear
do not then walk too open
in the south suburbs at the elephant is best to lodge
i will bespeak our diet whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town
haply your eye shall light upon some toy you have desire to purchase and your store i think is not for idle markets sir
i’ll be your purse bearer and leave you for an hour
he says he’ll come how shall i feast him
for youth is bought more oft than begg’d or borrow’d
i speak too loud — where’s malvolio —he is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes where is malvolio
he’s coming madam but in very strange manner
no madam he does nothing but smile your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits
i’m as mad as he if sad and merry madness equal be
i sent for thee upon a sad occasion
i could be sad this does make some obstruction in the blood this cross gartering
if it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true sonnet is ‘please one and please all ’ olivia
what is the matter with thee
not black in my mind though yellow in my legs
it did come to his hands and commands shall be executed
i think we do know the sweet roman hand
wilt thou go to bed malvolio
ay sweetheart and i’ll come to thee
why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady
‘be not afraid of greatness ’ ’twas well writ
what mean’st thou by that malvolio
‘and some have greatness thrust upon them ’ olivia
‘remember who commended thy yellow stockings’— olivia
‘and wished to see thee cross gartered ’ olivia
‘go to thou art made if thou desir’st to be so ’— olivia
‘if not let me see thee a servant still ’ olivia
why this is very midsummer madness
madam the young gentleman of the count orsino’s is returned i could hardly entreat him back
exit servant good maria let this fellow be looked to
let some of my people have a special care of him i would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry
o ho do you come near me now
no worse man than sir toby to look to me
this concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose that i may appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that in the letter
‘cast thy humble slough ’ says she ‘be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity ’ and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth
i have limed her but it is jove’s doing and jove make me thankful
and when she went away now ‘let this fellow be looked to ’ ‘fellow ’ not ‘malvolio’ nor after my degree but ‘fellow’
why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstance
nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes
well jove not i is the doer of this and he is to be thanked
enter sir toby fabian and maria
which way is he in the name of sanctity
if all the devils of hell be drawn in little and legion himself possessed him yet i’ll speak to him
here he is here he is
lo how hollow the fiend speaks within him
sir toby my lady prays you to have a care of him
go to go to peace peace we must deal gently with him
consider he’s an enemy to mankind
do you know what you say
la you an you speak ill of the devil how he takes it at heart
pray god he be not bewitched
carry his water to th’ wise woman
marry and it shall be done tomorrow morning if i live
my lady would not lose him for more than i’ll say
prithee hold thy peace this is not the way
do you not see you move him
no way but gentleness gently gently
the fiend is rough and will not be roughly used
what man ’tis not for gravity to play at cherry pit with satan
get him to say his prayers good sir toby get him to pray
no i warrant you he will not hear of godliness
i am not of your element
if this were played upon a stage now i could condemn it as an improbable fiction
his very genius hath taken the infection of the device man
nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint
why we shall make him mad indeed
the house will be the quieter
come we’ll have him in a dark room and bound
my niece is already in the belief that he’s mad
we may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance till our very pastime tired out of breath prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen
more matter for a may morning
i warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in’t
reads youth whatsoever thou art thou art but a scurvy fellow fabian
wonder not nor admire not in thy mind why i do call thee so for i will show thee no reason for’t fabian
a good note that keeps you from the blow of the law
thou comest to the lady olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not the matter i challenge thee for fabian
very brief and to exceeding good sense—less
i will waylay thee going home where if it be thy chance to kill me— fabian
thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain fabian
still you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law
fare thee well and god have mercy upon one of our souls
he may have mercy upon mine but my hope is better and so look to thyself
thy friend as thou usest him and thy sworn enemy andrew aguecheek if this letter move him not his legs cannot
you may have very fit occasion for’t
he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum baily
so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou draw’st swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him
nay let me alone for swearing
now will not i deliver his letter for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less
therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth
he will find it comes from a clodpole
but sir i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon aguecheek notable report of valour and drive the gentleman as i know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices
here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after him
i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge
exeunt sir toby fabian and maria olivia
i have said too much unto a heart of stone and laid mine honour too unchary on’t there’s something in me that reproves my fault but such a headstrong potent fault it is that it but mocks reproof
with the same ’haviour that your passion bears goes on my master’s griefs
here wear this jewel for me ’tis my picture
refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you
and i beseech you come again tomorrow
what shall you ask of me that i’ll deny that honour sav’d may upon asking give
nothing but this your true love for my master
how with mine honour may i give him that which i have given to you
fare thee well a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell
exit enter sir toby and fabian
that defence thou hast betake thee to’t
of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him i know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard end
dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skilful and deadly
you mistake sir i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me
my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man
you’ll find it otherwise i assure you
therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal
i pray you sir what is he
he is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl
souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre
hob nob is his word give’t or take’t
i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady
i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk
his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire
back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him
therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must that’s certain or forswear to wear iron about you
this is as uncivil as strange
i beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is
it is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose
signior fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return
pray you sir do you know of this matter
i know the knight is incensed against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more
i beseech you what manner of man is he
nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour
he is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria
i will make your peace with him if i can
i shall be much bound to you for’t
i am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight i care not who knows so much of my mettle
exeunt enter sir toby and sir andrew
why man he’s a very devil
i have not seen such a firago
i had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on
they say he has been fencer to the sophy
pox on’t i’ll not meddle with him
ay but he will not now be pacified fabian can scarce hold him yonder
plague on’t an i thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence i’d have seen him damned ere i’d have challenged him
let him let the matter slip and i’ll give him my horse grey capilet
stand here make a good show on’t
this shall end without the perdition of souls
aside marry i’ll ride your horse as well as i ride you
to fabian i have his horse to take up the quarrel
i have persuaded him the youth’s a devil
he is as horribly conceited of him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his heels
there’s no remedy sir he will fight with you for’s oath sake
marry he hath better bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of
therefore draw for the supportance of his vow he protests he will not hurt you
a little thing would make me tell them how much i lack of a man
give ground if you see him furious
come sir andrew there’s no remedy the gentleman will for his honour’s sake have one bout with you
he cannot by the duello avoid it but he has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you
draws pray god he keep his oath
draws i do assure you ’tis against my will
if this young gentleman have done offence i take the fault on me
if you offend him i for him defy you
draws one sir that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will
draws nay if you be an undertaker i am for you
to antonio i’ll be with you anon
to sir andrew pray sir put your sword up if you please
marry will i sir and for that i promised you i’ll be as good as my word
he will bear you easily and reins well
this is the man do thy office
antonio i arrest thee at the suit of count orsino
i know your favour well though now you have no sea cap on your head — take him away he knows i know him well
this comes with seeking you but there’s no remedy i shall answer it
now my necessity makes me to ask you for my purse
it grieves me much more for what i cannot do for you than what befalls myself
you stand amaz’d but be of comfort
i must entreat of you some of that money
for the fair kindness you have show’d me here and part being prompted by your present trouble out of my lean and low ability i’ll lend you something
my having is not much i’ll make division of my present with you
is’t possible that my deserts to you can lack persuasion
do not tempt my misery lest that it make me so unsound a man as to upbraid you with those kindnesses that i have done for you
i know of none nor know i you by voice or any feature
i hate ingratitude more in a man than lying vainness babbling drunkenness or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood
come sir i pray you go
this youth that you see here i snatch’d one half out of the jaws of death reliev’d him with such sanctity of love and to his image which methought did promise most venerable worth did i devotion
but o how vile an idol proves this god
thou hast sebastian done good feature shame
in nature there’s no blemish but the mind none can be call’d deform’d but the unkind
virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil are empty trunks o’erflourished by the devil
the man grows mad away with him
methinks his words do from such passion fly that he believes himself so do not i
prove true imagination o prove true that i dear brother be now ta’en for you
come hither knight come hither fabian
we’ll whisper o’er a couplet or two of most sage saws
i my brother know yet living in my glass even such and so in favour was my brother and he went still in this fashion colour ornament for him i imitate
o if it prove tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love
a very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a hare
his dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him and for his cowardship ask fabian
a coward a most devout coward religious in it
’slid i’ll after him again and beat him
do cuff him soundly but never draw thy sword
and i do not— exit fabian
i dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet
will you make me believe that i am not sent for you
go to go to thou art a foolish fellow
let me be clear of thee
no i do not know you nor i am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her nor your name is not master cesario nor this is not my nose neither
nothing that is so is so
i prithee vent thy folly somewhere else thou know’st not me
he has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool
i am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney
i prithee now ungird thy strangeness and tell me what i shall vent to my lady
shall i vent to her that thou art coming
i prithee foolish greek depart from me
there’s money for thee if you tarry longer i shall give worse payment
by my troth thou hast an open hand
these wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report—after fourteen years’ purchase
enter sir andrew sir toby and fabian
now sir have i met you again
why there’s for thee and there and there
hold sir or i’ll throw your dagger o’er the house
this will i tell my lady straight
i would not be in some of your coats for twopence
nay let him alone i’ll go another way to work with him
i’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in illyria
though i struck him first yet it’s no matter for that
come sir i will not let you go
come my young soldier put up your iron you are well fleshed
i will be free from thee
if thou dar’st tempt me further draw thy sword
nay then i must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you
on thy life i charge thee hold
ungracious wretch fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves where manners ne’er were preach’d
exeunt sir toby sir andrew and fabian i prithee gentle friend let thy fair wisdom not thy passion sway in this uncivil and unjust extent against thy peace
go with me to my house and hear thou there how many fruitless pranks this ruffian hath botch’d up that thou thereby mayst smile at this
thou shalt not choose but go
beshrew his soul for me he started one poor heart of mine in thee
or i am mad or else this is a dream
let fancy still my sense in lethe steep if it be thus to dream still let me sleep
would thou’dst be ruled by me
o say so and so be
nay i prithee put on this gown and this beard make him believe thou art sir topas the curate
i’ll call sir toby the whilst
well i’ll put it on and i will dissemble myself in’t and i would i were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown
i am not tall enough to become the function well nor lean enough to be thought a good student but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar
bonos dies sir toby for as the old hermit of prague that never saw pen and ink very wittily said to a niece of king gorboduc ‘that that is is’ so i being master parson am master parson for what is ‘that’ but ‘that’
sir topas the curate who comes to visit malvolio the lunatic
sir topas sir topas good sir topas go to my lady
talkest thou nothing but of ladies
sir topas never was man thus wronged
good sir topas do not think i am mad
they have laid me here in hideous darkness
i call thee by the most modest terms for i am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy
say’st thou that house is dark
why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony and yet complainest thou of obstruction
i am not mad sir topas
i say to you this house is dark
i say there is no darkness but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than the egyptians in their fog
i say this house is as dark as ignorance though ignorance were as dark as hell and i say there was never man thus abused
i am no more mad than you are
make the trial of it in any constant question
what is the opinion of pythagoras concerning wildfowl
that the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird
what think’st thou of his opinion
i think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion
thou shalt hold the opinion of pythagoras ere i will allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam
nay i am for all waters
thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown
to him in thine own voice and bring me word how thou find’st him
i would we were well rid of this knavery
if he may be conveniently delivered i would he were for i am now so far in offence with my niece that i cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot
come by and by to my chamber
exeunt sir toby and maria clown
singing hey robin jolly robin tell me how thy lady does malvolio
my lady is unkind perdy malvolio
alas why is she so malvolio
she loves another — who calls ha
good fool as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand help me to a candle and pen ink and paper
as i am a gentleman i will live to be thankful to thee for’t
alas sir how fell you besides your five wits
fool there was never man so notoriously abused
i am as well in my wits fool as thou art
then you are mad indeed if you be no better in your wits than a fool
they have here propertied me keep me in darkness send ministers to me asses and do all they can to face me out of my wits
advise you what you say the minister is here
as sir topas malvolio malvolio thy wits the heavens restore
endeavour thyself to sleep and leave thy vain bibble babble
as sir topas maintain no words with him good fellow
god buy you good sir topas

i am shent for speaking to you
good fool help me to some light and some paper
i tell thee i am as well in my wits as any man in illyria

good fool some ink paper and light and convey what i will set down to my lady
it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did
but tell me true are you not mad indeed
nay i’ll ne’er believe a madman till i see his brains
i will fetch you light and paper and ink
fool i’ll requite it in the highest degree i prithee be gone
singing i am gone sir and anon sir i’ll be with you again in a trice like to the old vice your need to sustain who with dagger of lath in his rage and his wrath cries ‘ah ha ’ to the devil like a mad lad ‘pare thy nails dad
adieu goodman devil ’ exit scene iii
this is the air that is the glorious sun this pearl she gave me i do feel’t and see’t and though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus yet ’tis not madness
i could not find him at the elephant yet there he was and there i found this credit that he did range the town to seek me out
his counsel now might do me golden service
for though my soul disputes well with my sense that this may be some error but no madness yet doth this accident and flood of fortune so far exceed all instance all discourse that i am ready to distrust mine eyes and wrangle with my reason that persuades me to any other trust but that i am mad or else the lady’s mad yet if ’twere so she could not sway her house command her followers take and give back affairs and their dispatch with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing as i perceive she does
there’s something in’t that is deceivable
blame not this haste of mine
if you mean well now go with me and with this holy man into the chantry by there before him and underneath that consecrated roof plight me the full assurance of your faith that my most jealous and too doubtful soul may live at peace
he shall conceal it whiles you are willing it shall come to note what time we will our celebration keep according to my birth
i’ll follow this good man and go with you and having sworn truth ever will be true
then lead the way good father and heavens so shine that they may fairly note this act of mine
now as thou lov’st me let me see his letter
good master fabian grant me another request
do not desire to see this letter
this is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again
enter duke viola curio and lords
belong you to the lady olivia friends
ay sir we are some of her trappings
how dost thou my good fellow
truly sir the better for my foes and the worse for my friends
just the contrary the better for thy friends
marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me
now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass so that by my foes sir i profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends i am abused
so that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes
by my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my friends
thou shalt not be the worse for me there’s gold
but that it would be double dealing sir i would you could make it another
o you give me ill counsel
put your grace in your pocket sir for this once and let your flesh and blood obey it
well i will be so much a sinner to be a double dealer there’s another
primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying is the third pays for all the triplex sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of saint bennet sir may put you in mind—one two three
you can fool no more money out of me at this throw
if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her and bring her along with you it may awake my bounty further
marry sir lullaby to your bounty till i come again
i go sir but i would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness but as you say sir let your bounty take a nap i will awake it anon
exit clown enter antonio and officers
here comes the man sir that did rescue me
that face of his i do remember well
yet when i saw it last it was besmear’d as black as vulcan in the smoke of war
a baubling vessel was he captain of for shallow draught and bulk unprizable with which such scathful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet that very envy and the tongue of loss cried fame and honour on him
orsino this is that antonio that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy and this is he that did the tiger board when your young nephew titus lost his leg
here in the streets desperate of shame and state in private brabble did we apprehend him
he did me kindness sir drew on my side but in conclusion put strange speech upon me
i know not what ’twas but distraction
notable pirate thou salt water thief what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear hast made thine enemies
orsino noble sir be pleased that i shake off these names you give me antonio never yet was thief or pirate though i confess on base and ground enough orsino’s enemy
a witchcraft drew me hither that most ingrateful boy there by your side from the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth did i redeem a wreck past hope he was
his life i gave him and did thereto add my love without retention or restraint all his in dedication
for his sake did i expose myself pure for his love into the danger of this adverse town drew to defend him when he was beset where being apprehended his false cunning not meaning to partake with me in danger taught him to face me out of his acquaintance and grew a twenty years’ removed thing while one would wink denied me mine own purse which i had recommended to his use not half an hour before
when came he to this town
today my lord and for three months before no int’rim not a minute’s vacancy both day and night did we keep company
here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth
but for thee fellow fellow thy words are madness
three months this youth hath tended upon me but more of that anon
what would my lord but that he may not have wherein olivia may seem serviceable
cesario you do not keep promise with me
my lord would speak my duty hushes me
if it be aught to the old tune my lord it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear as howling after music
you uncivil lady to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the faithfull’st off’rings hath breathed out that e’er devotion tender’d
even what it please my lord that shall become him
why should i not had i the heart to do it like to the egyptian thief at point of death kill what i love —a savage jealousy that sometime savours nobly
but hear me this since you to non regardance cast my faith and that i partly know the instrument that screws me from my true place in your favour live you the marble breasted tyrant still
but this your minion whom i know you love and whom by heaven i swear i tender dearly him will i tear out of that cruel eye where he sits crowned in his master’s spite — come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief i’ll sacrifice the lamb that i do love to spite a raven’s heart within a dove
and i most jocund apt and willingly to do you rest a thousand deaths would die
after him i love more than i love these eyes more than my life more by all mores than e’er i shall love wife
if i do feign you witnesses above punish my life for tainting of my love
no my lord not i olivia
alas it is the baseness of thy fear that makes thee strangle thy propriety
fear not cesario take thy fortunes up
be that thou know’st thou art and then thou art as great as that thou fear’st
father i charge thee by thy reverence here to unfold—though lately we intended to keep in darkness what occasion now reveals before ’tis ripe—what thou dost know hath newly passed between this youth and me
a contract of eternal bond of love confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands attested by the holy close of lips strengthen’d by interchangement of your rings and all the ceremony of this compact sealed in my function by my testimony since when my watch hath told me toward my grave i have travelled but two hours
what wilt thou be when time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case
or will not else thy craft so quickly grow that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow
farewell and take her but direct thy feet where thou and i henceforth may never meet
my lord i do protest— olivia
hold little faith though thou has too much fear
for the love of god a surgeon
send one presently to sir toby
’has broke my head across and has given sir toby a bloody coxcomb too
for the love of god your help
i had rather than forty pound i were at home
who has done this sir andrew
we took him for a coward but he’s the very devil incardinate
’od’s lifelings here he is —you broke my head for nothing and that that i did i was set on to do’t by sir toby
why do you speak to me
i never hurt you you drew your sword upon me without cause but i bespake you fair and hurt you not
enter sir toby drunk led by the clown
if a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me
i think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb
here comes sir toby halting you shall hear more but if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did
that’s all one ’has hurt me and there’s th’ end on’t
sot didst see dick surgeon sot
o he’s drunk sir toby an hour agone his eyes were set at eight i’ th’ morning
then he’s a rogue and a passy measures pavin
who hath made this havoc with them
i’ll help you sir toby because we’ll be dressed together
an ass head and a coxcomb and a knave a thin faced knave a gull
get him to bed and let his hurt be looked to
exeunt clown fabian sir toby and sir andrew enter sebastian
i am sorry madam i have hurt your kinsman but had it been the brother of my blood i must have done no less with wit and safety
you throw a strange regard upon me and by that i do perceive it hath offended you
pardon me sweet one even for the vows we made each other but so late ago
one face one voice one habit and two persons
a natural perspective that is and is not
how have the hours rack’d and tortur’d me since i have lost thee
how have you made division of yourself
an apple cleft in two is not more twin than these two creatures
i never had a brother nor can there be that deity in my nature of here and everywhere
i had a sister whom the blind waves and surges have devoured
of charity what kin are you to me
of messaline sebastian was my father such a sebastian was my brother too so went he suited to his watery tomb
if spirits can assume both form and suit you come to fright us
a spirit i am indeed but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb i did participate
were you a woman as the rest goes even i should my tears let fall upon your cheek and say ‘thrice welcome drowned viola ’ viola
my father had a mole upon his brow
and died that day when viola from her birth had numbered thirteen years
o that record is lively in my soul
he finished indeed his mortal act that day that made my sister thirteen years
if nothing lets to make us happy both but this my masculine usurp’d attire do not embrace me till each circumstance of place time fortune do cohere and jump that i am viola which to confirm i’ll bring you to a captain in this town where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help i was preserv’d to serve this noble count
all the occurrence of my fortune since hath been between this lady and this lord
to olivia so comes it lady you have been mistook
but nature to her bias drew in that
you would have been contracted to a maid nor are you therein by my life deceived you are betroth’d both to a maid and man
be not amazed right noble is his blood
if this be so as yet the glass seems true i shall have share in this most happy wreck
to viola boy thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me
and all those sayings will i over swear and all those swearings keep as true in soul as doth that orbed continent the fire that severs day from night
give me thy hand and let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds
the captain that did bring me first on shore hath my maid’s garments
he upon some action is now in durance at malvolio’s suit a gentleman and follower of my lady’s
and yet alas now i remember me they say poor gentleman he’s much distract
enter clown with a letter and fabian
a most extracting frenzy of mine own from my remembrance clearly banished his
truly madam he holds belzebub at the stave’s end as well as a man in his case may do
has here writ a letter to you
i should have given it you today morning but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are delivered
look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman
by the lord madam — olivia
no madam i do but read madness an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allow vox
prithee read i’ thy right wits
but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear
to fabian read it you sirrah
reads by the lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it
though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship
i have your own letter that induced me to the semblance i put on with the which i doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame
think of me as you please
i leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury
this savours not much of distraction
see him delivered fabian bring him hither
exit fabian my lord so please you these things further thought on to think me as well a sister as a wife one day shall crown th’ alliance on’t so please you here at my house and at my proper cost
madam i am most apt t’ embrace your offer
to viola your master quits you and for your service done him so much against the mettle of your sex so far beneath your soft and tender breeding and since you call’d me master for so long here is my hand you shall from this time be you master’s mistress
madam you have done me wrong notorious wrong
you must not now deny it is your hand write from it if you can in hand or phrase or say ’tis not your seal not your invention you can say none of this
well grant it then and tell me in the modesty of honour why you have given me such clear lights of favour bade me come smiling and cross garter’d to you to put on yellow stockings and to frown upon sir toby and the lighter people and acting this in an obedient hope why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d kept in a dark house visited by the priest and made the most notorious geck and gull that e’er invention played on
alas malvolio this is not my writing though i confess much like the character but out of question ’tis maria’s hand
and now i do bethink me it was she first told me thou wast mad then cam’st in smiling and in such forms which here were presuppos’d upon thee in the letter
this practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee
but when we know the grounds and authors of it thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge of thine own cause
good madam hear me speak and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come taint the condition of this present hour which i have wonder’d at
in hope it shall not most freely i confess myself and toby set this device against malvolio here upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts we had conceiv’d against him
maria writ the letter at sir toby’s great importance in recompense whereof he hath married her
how with a sportful malice it was follow’d may rather pluck on laughter than revenge if that the injuries be justly weigh’d that have on both sides passed
alas poor fool how have they baffled thee
why ‘some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them ’ i was one sir in this interlude one sir topas sir but that’s all one
‘by the lord fool i am not mad ’ but do you remember
‘madam why laugh you at such a barren rascal
and you smile not he’s gagged’
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
i’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you
he hath been most notoriously abus’d
pursue him and entreat him to a peace he hath not told us of the captain yet
when that is known and golden time convents a solemn combination shall be made of our dear souls —meantime sweet sister we will not part from hence —cesario come for so you shall be while you are a man but when in other habits you are seen orsino’s mistress and his fancy’s queen
an open place enter valentine and proteus valentine
cease to persuade my loving proteus home keeping youth have ever homely wits
were t not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honour d love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggardiz d at home wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
but since thou lov st love still and thrive therein even as i would when i to love begin
think on thy proteus when thou haply seest some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger if ever danger do environ thee commend thy grievance to my holy prayers for i will be thy headsman valentine
and on a love book pray for my success
upon some book i love i ll pray for thee
that s on some shallow story of deep love how young leander cross d the hellespont
that s a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love
tis true for you are over boots in love and yet you never swum the hellespont
nay give me not the boots
no i will not for it boots thee not
to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment s mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights if haply won perhaps a hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labour won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished
so by your circumstance you call me fool
so by your circumstance i fear you ll prove
tis love you cavil at i am not love
love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise
yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all
and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow even so by love the young and tender wit is turn d to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes
but wherefore waste i time to counsel the that art a votary to fond desire
my father at the road expects my coming there to see me shipp d
and thither will i bring thee valentine
sweet proteus no now let us take our leave
to milan let me hear from thee by letters of thy success in love and what news else betideth here in absence of thy friend and i likewise will visit thee with mine
all happiness bechance to thee in milan
as much to you at home and so farewell
he after honour hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love
thou julia thou hast metamorphis d me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at nought made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
but now he parted hence to embark for milan
twenty to one then he is shipp d already and i have play d the sheep in losing him
indeed a sheep doth very often stray an if the shepherd be awhile away
you conclude that my master is a shepherd then and i a sheep
why then my horns are his horns whether i wake or sleep
a silly answer and fitting well a sheep
this proves me still a sheep
true and thy master a shepherd
nay that i can deny by a circumstance
it shall go hard but i ll prove it by another
the shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but i seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep
the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee
such another proof will make me cry baa
gav st thou my letter to julia
ay sir i a lost mutton gave your letter to her a lac d mutton and she a lac d mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labour
here s too small a pasture for such store of muttons
if the ground be overcharg d you were best stick her
nay in that you are astray twere best pound you
nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter
you mistake i mean the pound a pinfold
from a pound to a pin
fold it over and over tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover
you mistook sir i say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and i say ay
and that set together is noddy
now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains
no no you shall have it for bearing the letter
well i perceive i must be fain to bear with you
why sir how do you bear with me
marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word noddy for my pains
beshrew me but you have a quick wit
and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
come come open the matter in brief what said she
open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered
well sir here is for your pains
truly sir i think you ll hardly win her
why couldst thou perceive so much from her
sir i could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind i fear she ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind
give her no token but stones for she s as hard as steel
no not so much as take this for thy pains
to testify your bounty i thank you you have testern d me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir i ll commend you to my master
go go be gone to save your ship from wreck which cannot perish having thee aboard being destin d to a drier death on shore
exit speed i must go send some better messenger
i fear my julia would not deign my lines receiving them from such a worthless post
the garden of julia s house enter julia and lucetta julia
but say lucetta now we are alone wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
of all the fair resort of gentlemen that every day with parle encounter me in thy opinion which is worthiest love
please you repeat their names i ll show my mind according to my shallow simple skill
what think st thou of the fair sir eglamour
as of a knight well spoken neat and fine but were i you he never should be mine
what think st thou of the rich mercatio
well of his wealth but of himself so so
what think st thou of the gentle proteus
to see what folly reigns in us
what means this passion at his name
pardon dear madam tis a passing shame that i unworthy body as i am should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
why not on proteus as of all the rest
then thus of many good i think him best
i have no other but a woman s reason i think him so because i think him so
and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
ay if you thought your love not cast away
why he of all the rest hath never mov d me
yet he of all the rest i think best loves ye
his little speaking shows his love but small
fire that s closest kept burns most of all
they do not love that do not show their love
o they love least that let men know their love
i would i knew his mind
say say who gave it thee
sir valentine s page and sent i think from proteus
he would have given it you but i being in the way did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray
now by my modesty a goodly broker
dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
to whisper and conspire against my youth
now trust me tis an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the place
there take the paper see it be return d or else return no more into my sight
to plead for love deserves more fee than hate
and yet i would i had o erlook d the letter
it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her
what fool is she that knows i am a maid and would not force the letter to my view
since maids in modesty say no to that which they would have the profferer construe ay
fie fie how wayward is this foolish love that like a testy babe will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod
how churlishly i chid lucetta hence when willingly i would have had her here
how angerly i taught my brow to frown when inward joy enforc d my heart to smile
my penance is to call lucetta back and ask remission for my folly past
i would it were that you might kill your stomach on your meat and not upon your maid
what is t that you took up so gingerly
to take a paper up that i let fall
then let it lie for those that it concerns
madam it will not lie where it concerns unless it have a false interpreter
some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
that i might sing it madam to a tune
give me a note your ladyship can set
as little by such toys as may be possible
best sing it to the tune of light o love
it is too heavy for so light a tune
belike it hath some burden then
ay and melodious were it would you sing it
lucetta withholds the letter how now minion
keep tune there still so you will sing it out
and yet methinks i do not like this tune
nay now you are too flat and mar the concord with too harsh a descant there wanteth but a mean to fill your song
the mean is drown d with your unruly bass
indeed i bid the base for proteus
this babble shall not henceforth trouble me
here is a coil with protestation
tears the letter go get you gone and let the papers lie
you would be fing ring them to anger me
she makes it strange but she would be best pleas d to be so ang red with another letter
nay would i were so ang red with the same
o hateful hands to tear such loving words
injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey and kill the bees that yield it with your stings
i ll kiss each several paper for amends
look here is writ kind julia
unkind julia as in revenge of thy ingratitude i throw thy name against the bruising stones trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
and here is writ love wounded proteus
my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal d and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss
but twice or thrice was proteus written down
be calm good wind blow not a word away till i have found each letter in the letter except mine own name that some whirlwind bear unto a ragged fearful hanging rock and throw it thence into the raging sea
lo here in one line is his name twice writ poor forlorn proteus passionate proteus to the sweet julia
that i ll tear away and yet i will not sith so prettily he couples it to his complaining names
thus will i fold them one upon another now kiss embrace contend do what you will
madam dinner is ready and your father stays
what shall these papers lie like tell tales here
if you respect them best to take them up
nay i was taken up for laying them down yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
i see you have a month s mind to them
ay madam you may say what sights you see i see things too although you judge i wink
come come will t please you go
antonio s house enter antonio and panthino antonio
tell me panthino what sad talk was that wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
twas of his nephew proteus your son
he wond red that your lordship would suffer him to spend his youth at home while other men of slender reputation put forth their sons to seek preferment out some to the wars to try their fortune there some to discover islands far away some to the studious universities
for any or for all these exercises he said that proteus your son was meet and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home which would be great impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth
nor need st thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering
i have consider d well his loss of time and how he cannot be a perfect man not being tried and tutor d in the world experience is by industry achiev d and perfected by the swift course of time
then tell me whither were i best to send him
i think your lordship is not ignorant how his companion youthful valentine attends the emperor in his royal court
twere good i think your lordship sent him thither there shall he practise tilts and tournaments hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen and be in eye of every exercise worthy his youth and nobleness of birth
i like thy counsel well hast thou advis d and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it the execution of it shall make known even with the speediest expedition i will dispatch him to the emperor s court
to morrow may it please you don alphonso with other gentlemen of good esteem are journeying to salute the emperor and to commend their service to his will
good company with them shall proteus go
enter proteus and in good time now will we break with him
here is her hand the agent of her heart here is her oath for love her honour s pawn
o that our fathers would applaud our loves to seal our happiness with their consents
what letter are you reading there
may t please your lordship tis a word or two of commendations sent from valentine deliver d by a friend that came from him
lend me the letter let me see what news
there is no news my lord but that he writes how happily he lives how well belov d and daily graced by the emperor wishing me with him partner of his fortune
and how stand you affected to his wish
as one relying on your lordship s will and not depending on his friendly wish
my will is something sorted with his wish
muse not that i thus suddenly proceed for what i will i will and there an end
i am resolv d that thou shalt spend some time with valentinus in the emperor s court what maintenance he from his friends receives like exhibition thou shalt have from me
to morrow be in readiness to go excuse it not for i am peremptory
my lord i cannot be so soon provided please you deliberate a day or two
look what thou want st shall be sent after thee
no more of stay to morrow thou must go
come on panthino you shall be employ d to hasten on his expedition
thus have i shunn d the fire for fear of burning and drench d me in the sea where i am drown d
i fear d to show my father julia s letter lest he should take exceptions to my love and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love
o how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day which now shows all the beauty of the sun and by an by a cloud takes all away
sir proteus your father calls for you he is in haste therefore i pray you go
why this it is my heart accords thereto and yet a thousand times it answers no
the duke s palace enter valentine and speed speed
not mine my gloves are on
why then this may be yours for this is but one
let me see ay give it me it s mine sweet ornament that decks a thing divine
she is not within hearing sir
why sir who bade you call her
your worship sir or else i mistook
well you ll still be too forward
and yet i was last chidden for being too slow
go to sir tell me do you know madam silvia
why how know you that i am in love
marry by these special marks first you have learn d like sir proteus to wreath your arms like a malcontent to relish a love song like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a school boy that had lost his a b c to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at hallowmas
you were wont when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walk d to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you look d sadly it was for want of money
and now you are metamorphis d with a mistress that when i look on you i can hardly think you my master
are all these things perceiv d in me
they are all perceiv d without ye
nay that s certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady
but tell me dost thou know my lady silvia
she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
why sir i know her not
dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet know st her not
is she not hard favour d sir
not so fair boy as well favour d
sir i know that well enough
that she is not so fair as of you well favour d
i mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite
that s because the one is painted and the other out of all count
marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beauty
you never saw her since she was deform d
how long hath she been deform d
ever since you lov d her
i have lov d her ever since i saw her and still i see her beautiful
if you love her you cannot see her
o that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir proteus for going ungarter d
your own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love cannot see to put on your hose
belike boy then you are in love for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes
true sir i was in love with my bed
i thank you you swing d me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours
in conclusion i stand affected to her
i would you were set so your affection would cease
last night she enjoin d me to write some lines to one she loves
no boy but as well as i can do them
now will he interpret to her
madam and mistress a thousand good morrows
aside o give ye good ev n
here s a million of manners
sir valentine and servant to you two thousand
aside he should give her interest and she gives it him
as you enjoin d me i have writ your letter unto the secret nameless friend of yours which i was much unwilling to proceed in but for my duty to your ladyship
now trust me madam it came hardly off for being ignorant to whom it goes i writ at random very doubtfully
perchance you think too much of so much pains
no madam so it stead you i will write please you command a thousand times as much and yet silvia
well i guess the sequel and yet i will not name it and yet i care not
and yet take this again and yet i thank you meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
aside and yet you will and yet another yet
yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ but since unwillingly take them again
ay ay you writ them sir at my request but i will none of them they are for you i would have had them writ more movingly
please you i ll write your ladyship another
and when it s writ for my sake read it over and if it please you so if not why so
if it please me madam what then
why if it please you take it for your labour
o jest unseen inscrutable invisible as a nose on a man s face or a weathercock on a steeple
my master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor he being her pupil to become her tutor
was there ever heard a better that my master being scribe to himself should write the letter
what are you reasoning with yourself
nay i was rhyming tis you that have the reason
to be a spokesman from madam silvia
to yourself why she woos you by a figure
by a letter i should say
why she hath not writ to me
what need she when she hath made you write to yourself
why do you not perceive the jest
but did you perceive her earnest
she gave me none except an angry word
why she hath given you a letter
that s the letter i writ to her friend
and that letter hath she deliver d and there an end
i would it were no worse
i ll warrant you tis as well
for often have you writ to her and she in modesty or else for want of idle time could not again reply or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover
all this i speak in print for in print i found it
ay but hearken sir though the chameleon love can feed on the air i am one that am nourish d by my victuals and would fain have meat
o be not like your mistress
julia s house enter proteus and julia proteus
i must where is no remedy
when possibly i can i will return
if you turn not you will return the sooner
keep this remembrance for thy julia s sake
why then we ll make exchange
and seal the bargain with a holy kiss
here is my hand for my true constancy and when that hour o erslips me in the day wherein i sigh not julia for thy sake the next ensuing hour some foul mischance torment me for my love s forgetfulness
my father stays my coming answer not the tide is now nay not thy tide of tears that tide will stay me longer than i should
exit julia what gone without a word
ay so true love should do it cannot speak for truth hath better deeds than words to grace it
sir proteus you are stay d for
this parting strikes poor lovers dumb
a street enter launce leading a dog launce
nay twill be this hour ere i have done weeping all the kind of the launces have this very fault
i have receiv d my proportion like the prodigious son and am going with sir proteus to the imperial s court
i think crab my dog be the sourest natured dog that lives my mother weeping my father wailing my sister crying our maid howling our cat wringing her hands and all our house in a great perplexity yet did not this cruel hearted cur shed one tear
he is a stone a very pebble stone and has no more pity in him than a dog
a jew would have wept to have seen our parting why my grandam having no eyes look you wept herself blind at my parting
nay i ll show you the manner of it
this shoe is my father no this left shoe is my father no no left shoe is my mother nay that cannot be so neither yes it is so it is so it hath the worser sole
this shoe with the hole in it is my mother and this my father
now sir this staff is my sister for look you she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand this hat is nan our maid i am the dog no the dog is himself and i am the dog o the dog is me and i am myself ay so so
now come i to my father father your blessing
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping now should i kiss my father well he weeps on
now come i to my mother
o that she could speak now like a wood woman
well i kiss her why there tis here s my mother s breath up and down
now come i to my sister mark the moan she makes
now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word but see how i lay the dust with my tears
thy master is shipp d and thou art to post after with oars
you ll lose the tide if you tarry any longer
it is no matter if the tied were lost for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied
why he that s tied here crab my dog
tut man i mean thou lt lose the flood and in losing the flood lose thy voyage and in losing thy voyage lose thy master and in losing thy master lose thy service and in losing thy service why dost thou stop my mouth
for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue
where should i lose my tongue
lose the tide and the voyage and the master and the service and the tied
why man if the river were dry i am able to fill it with my tears if the wind were down i could drive the boat with my sighs
come come away man i was sent to call thee
sir call me what thou dar st
the duke s palace enter silvia valentine thurio and speed silvia
master sir thurio frowns on you
ay boy it s for love
twere good you knock d him
seem you that you are not
what seem i that i am not
and how quote you my folly
i quote it in your jerkin
well then i ll double your folly
give him leave madam he is a kind of chameleon
that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air
ay sir and done too for this time
i know it well sir you always end ere you begin
a fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off
tis indeed madam we thank the giver
yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire
sir thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship s looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your company
sir if you spend word for word with me i shall make your wit bankrupt
i know it well sir you have an exchequer of words and i think no other treasure to give your followers for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words
now daughter silvia you are hard beset
sir valentine your father is in good health
what say you to a letter from your friends of much good news
my lord i will be thankful to any happy messenger from thence
know ye don antonio your countryman
ay my good lord i know the gentleman to be of worth and worthy estimation and not without desert so well reputed
ay my good lord a son that well deserves the honour and regard of such a father
beshrew me sir but if he make this good he is as worthy for an empress love as meet to be an emperor s counsellor
well sir this gentleman is come to me with commendation from great potentates and here he means to spend his time awhile
i think tis no unwelcome news to you
should i have wish d a thing it had been he
welcome him then according to his worth silvia i speak to you and you sir thurio for valentine i need not cite him to it
i will send him hither to you presently
this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me but that his mistresss did hold his eyes lock d in her crystal looks
belike that now she hath enfranchis d them upon some other pawn for fealty
nay sure i think she holds them prisoners still
nay then he should be blind and being blind how could he see his way to seek out you
why lady love hath twenty pair of eyes
they say that love hath not an eye at all
to see such lovers thurio as yourself upon a homely object love can wink
have done have done here comes the gentleman
mistress i beseech you confirm his welcome with some special favour
his worth is warrant for his welcome hither if this be he you oft have wish d to hear from
mistress it is sweet lady entertain him to be my fellow servant to your ladyship
too low a mistress for so high a servant
not so sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress
leave off discourse of disability sweet lady entertain him for your servant
my duty will i boast of nothing else
and duty never yet did want his meed
servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
i ll die on him that says so but yourself
madam my lord your father would speak with you
come sir thurio go with me
i ll leave you to confer of home affairs when you have done we look to hear from you
we ll both attend upon your ladyship
now tell me how do all from whence you came
your friends are well and have them much commended
i left them all in health
how does your lady and how thrives your love
my tales of love were wont to weary you i know you joy not in a love discourse
ay proteus but that life is alter d now i have done penance for contemning love whose high imperious thoughts have punish d me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heart sore sighs for in revenge of my contempt of love love hath chas d sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart s sorrow
o gentle proteus love s a mighty lord and hath so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth
now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love
enough i read your fortune in your eye
was this the idol that you worship so
even she and is she not a heavenly saint
no but she is an earthly paragon
o flatter me for love delights in praises
when i was sick you gave me bitter pills and i must minister the like to you
then speak the truth by her if not divine yet let her be a principality sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
sweet except not any except thou wilt except against my love
have i not reason to prefer mine own
and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honour to bear my lady s train lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and of so great a favour growing proud disdain to root the summer swelling flow r and make rough winter everlastingly
why valentine what braggardism is this
pardon me proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing she is alone
why man she is mine own and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas if all their sand were pearl the water nectar and the rocks pure gold
forgive me that i do not dream on thee because thou seest me dote upon my love
my foolish rival that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge is gone with her along and i must after for love thou know st is full of jealousy
ay and we are betroth d nay more our marriage hour with all the cunning manner of our flight determin d of how i must climb her window the ladder made of cords and all the means plotted and greed on for my happiness
good proteus go with me to my chamber in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
go on before i shall enquire you forth i must unto the road to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use and then i ll presently attend you
exit valentine even as one heat another heat expels or as one nail by strength drives out another so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten
is it my mind or valentinus praise her true perfection or my false transgression that makes me reasonless to reason thus
she is fair and so is julia that i love that i did love for now my love is thaw d which like a waxen image gainst a fire bears no impression of the thing it was
methinks my zeal to valentine is cold and that i love him not as i was wont
but i love his lady too too much and that s the reason i love him so little
how shall i dote on her with more advice that thus without advice begin to love her
tis but her picture i have yet beheld and that hath dazzled my reason s light but when i look on her perfections there is no reason but i shall be blind
if i can check my erring love i will if not to compass her i ll use my skill
a street enter speed and launce severally speed
by mine honesty welcome to padua
forswear not thyself sweet youth for i am not welcome
i reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hang d nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say welcome
come on you madcap i ll to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes
but sirrah how did thy master part with madam julia
marry after they clos d in earnest they parted very fairly in jest
no they are both as whole as a fish
why then how stands the matter with them
marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with her
what a block art thou that thou canst not
ay and what i do too look thee i ll but lean and my staff understands me
why stand under and under stand is all one
but tell me true will t be a match
if he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will
the conclusion is then that it will
thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable
tis well that i get it so
but launce how say st thou that my master is become a notable lover
a notable lubber as thou reportest him to be
why thou whoreson ass thou mistak st me
why fool i meant not thee i meant thy master
i tell thee my master is become a hot lover
why i tell thee i care not though he burn himself in love
if thou wilt go with me to the alehouse if not thou art an hebrew a jew and not worth the name of a christian
because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a christian
the duke s palace enter proteus proteus
to leave my julia shall i be forsworn to love fair silvia shall i be forsworn to wrong my friend i shall be much forsworn and ev n that pow r which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury love bade me swear and love bids me forswear
o sweet suggesting love if thou hast sinn d teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
at first i did adore a twinkling star but now i worship a celestial sun
unheedful vows may heedfully be broken and he wants wit that wants resolved will to learn his wit t exchange the bad for better
fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr d with twenty thousand soul confirming oaths
i cannot leave to love and yet i do but there i leave to love where i should love
julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them i needs must lose myself if i lose them thus find i by their loss for valentine myself for julia silvia
i to myself am dearer than a friend for love is still most precious in itself and silvia witness heaven that made her fair shows julia but a swarthy ethiope
i will forget that julia is alive rememb ring that my love to her is dead and valentine i ll hold an enemy aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend
i cannot now prove constant to myself without some treachery us d to valentine
this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial silvia s chamber window myself in counsel his competitor
now presently i ll give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight who all enrag d will banish valentine for thurio he intends shall wed his daughter but valentine being gone i ll quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio s dull proceeding
love lend me wings to make my purpose swift as thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift
julia s house enter julia and lucetta julia
counsel lucetta gentle girl assist me and ev n in kind love i do conjure thee who art the table wherein all my thoughts are visibly character d and engrav d to lesson me and tell me some good mean how with my honour i may undertake a journey to my loving proteus
alas the way is wearisome and long
a true devoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she that hath love s wings to fly and when the flight is made to one so dear of such divine perfection as sir proteus
better forbear till proteus make return
o know st thou not his looks are my soul s food
pity the dearth that i have pined in by longing for that food so long a time
didst thou but know the inly touch of love
thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words
i do not seek to quench your love s hot fire but qualify the fire s extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
the more thou dam st it up the more it burns
the current that with gentle murmur glides thou know st being stopp d impatiently doth rage but when his fair course is not hindered he makes sweet music with th enamell d stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean
then let me go and hinder not my course
i ll be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step till the last step have brought me to my love and there i ll rest as after much turmoil a blessed soul doth in elysium
but in what habit will you go along
not like a woman for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta fit me with such weeds as may beseem some well reputed page
why then your ladyship must cut your hair
no girl i ll knit it up in silken strings with twenty odd conceited true love knots to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall show to be
what fashion madam shall i make your breeches
that fits as well as tell me good my lord what compass will you wear your farthingale
why ev n what fashion thou best likes lucetta
you must needs have them with a codpiece madam
out out lucetta that will be ill favour d
a round hose madam now s not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
lucetta as thou lov st me let me have what thou think st meet and is most mannerly
but tell me wench how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey
i fear me it will make me scandaliz d
if you think so then stay at home and go not
then never dream on infamy but go
if proteus like your journey when you come no matter who s displeas d when you are gone
i fear me he will scarce be pleas d withal
that is the least lucetta of my fear a thousand oaths an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus
all these are servants to deceitful men
base men that use them to so base effect
but truer stars did govern proteus birth his words are bonds his oaths are oracles his love sincere his thoughts immaculate his tears pure messengers sent from his heart his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
pray heav n he prove so when you come to him
now as thou lov st me do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him
and presently go with me to my chamber to take a note of what i stand in need of to furnish me upon my longing journey
all that is mine i leave at thy dispose my goods my lands my reputation only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
come answer not but to it presently i am impatient of my tarriance
the duke s palace enter duke thurio and proteus duke
sir thurio give us leave i pray awhile we have some secrets to confer about
exit thurio now tell me proteus what s your will with me
my gracious lord that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal but when i call to mind your gracious favours done to me undeserving as i am my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me
know worthy prince sir valentine my friend this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot
i know you have determin d to bestow her on thurio whom your gentle daughter hates and should she thus be stol n away from you it would be much vexation to your age
thus for my duty s sake i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than by concealing it heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down being unprevented to your timeless grave
proteus i thank thee for thine honest care which to requite command me while i live
this love of theirs myself have often seen haply when they have judg d me fast asleep and oftentimes have purpos d to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man a rashness that i ever yet have shunn d i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclos d to me
and that thou mayst perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tow r the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she cannot be convey d away
know noble lord they have devis d a mean how he her chamber window will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently where if it please you you may intercept him
but good my lord do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at for love of you not hate unto my friend hath made me publisher of this pretence
upon mine honour he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this
adieu my lord sir valentine is coming
sir valentine whither away so fast
please it your grace there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends and i am going to deliver them
the tenour of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court
nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret
tis not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter
i know it well my lord and sure the match were rich and honourable besides the gentleman is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
cannot your grace win her to fancy him
no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherish d by her childlike duty i now am full resolv d to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in
then let her beauty be her wedding dow r for me and my possessions she esteems not
what would your grace have me to do in this
there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence
now therefore would i have thee to my tutor for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is chang d how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her sun bright eye
win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman s mind
but she did scorn a present that i sent her
a woman sometime scorns what best contents her
send her another never give her o er for scorn at first makes after love the more
if she do frown tis not in hate of you but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide tis not to have you gone for why the fools are mad if left alone
take no repulse whatever she doth say for get you gone she doth not mean away
flatter and praise commend extol their graces though ne er so black say they have angels faces
that man that hath a tongue i say is no man if with his tongue he cannot win a woman
but she i mean is promis d by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her
why then i would resort to her by night
ay but the doors be lock d and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night
what lets but one may enter at her window
her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one cannot climb it without apparent hazard of his life
why then a ladder quaintly made of cords to cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks would serve to scale another hero s tow r so bold leander would adventure it
now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder
this very night for love is like a child that longs for everything that he can come by
by seven o clock i ll get you such a ladder
but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither
it will be light my lord that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length
a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
then let me see thy cloak
i ll get me one of such another length
why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak
i pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
and here an engine fit for my proceeding
i ll be so bold to break the seal for once
reads my thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly and slaves they are to me that send them flying
o could their master come and go as lightly himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i their king that thither them importune do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them because myself do want my servants fortune
i curse myself for they are sent by me that they should harbour where their lord should be
silvia this night i will enfranchise thee
tis so and here s the ladder for the purpose
why phaethon for thou art merops son wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car and with thy daring folly burn the world
wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
go base intruder over weening slave bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates and think my patience more than thy desert is privilege for thy departure hence
thank me for this more than for all the favours which all too much i have bestow d on thee
but if thou linger in my territories longer than swiftest expedition will give thee time to leave our royal court by heaven
my wrath shall far exceed the love i ever bore my daughter or thyself
be gone i will not hear thy vain excuse but as thou lov st thy life make speed from hence
and why not death rather than living torment
to die is to be banish d from myself and silvia is myself banish d from her is self from self a deadly banishment
what light is light if silvia be not seen
what joy is joy if silvia be not by
unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection
except i be by silvia in the night there is no music in the nightingale unless i look on silvia in the day there is no day for me to look upon
she is my essence and i leave to be if i be not by her fair influence foster d illumin d cherish d kept alive
i fly not death to fly his deadly doom tarry i here i but attend on death but fly i hence i fly away from life
run boy run run seek him out
him we go to find there s not a hair on s head but tis a valentine
why sir i ll strike nothing
my ears are stopp d and cannot hear good news so much of bad already hath possess d them
then in dumb silence will i bury mine for they are harsh untuneable and bad
no valentine indeed for sacred silvia
no valentine if silvia have forsworn me
sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
that thou art banished o that s the news from hence from silvia and from me thy friend
o i have fed upon this woe already and now excess of it will make me surfeit
doth silvia know that i am banished
ay ay and she hath offered to the doom which unrevers d stands in effectual force a sea of melting pearl which some call tears those at her father s churlish feet she tender d with them upon her knees her humble self wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them as if but now they waxed pale for woe
but neither bended knees pure hands held up sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears could penetrate her uncompassionate sire but valentine if he be ta en must die
besides her intercession chaf d him so when she for thy repeal was suppliant that to close prison he commanded her with many bitter threats of biding there
no more unless the next word that thou speak st have some malignant power upon my life if so i pray thee breathe it in mine ear as ending anthem of my endless dolour
cease to lament for that thou canst not help and study help for that which thou lament st
time is the nurse and breeder of all good
here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love besides thy staying will abridge thy life
hope is a lover s staff walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts
thy letters may be here though thou art hence which being writ to me shall be deliver d even in the milk white bosom of thy love
the time now serves not to expostulate
come i ll convey thee through the city gate and ere i part with thee confer at large of all that may concern thy love affairs
as thou lov st silvia though not for thyself regard thy danger and along with me
i pray thee launce an if thou seest my boy bid him make haste and meet me at the northgate
i am but a fool look you and yet i have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but that s all one if he be but one knave
he lives not now that knows me to be in love yet i am in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who tis i love and yet tis a woman but what woman i will not tell myself and yet tis a milkmaid yet tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet tis a maid for she is her master s maid and serves for wages
she hath more qualities than a water spaniel which is much in a bare christian
here is the cate log pulling out a paper of her condition
inprimis she can fetch and carry
why a horse can do no more nay a horse cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade
look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands
well your old vice still mistake the word
what news then in your paper
the black st news that ever thou heard st
fie on thee jolt head thou canst not read
tell me this who begot thee
marry the son of my grandfather
it was the son of thy grandmother
this proves that thou canst not read
come fool come try me in thy paper
handing over the paper there and saint nicholas be thy speed
and thereof comes the proverb blessing of your heart you brew good ale
that s as much as to say can she so
what need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stock
item she can wash and scour
a special virtue for then she need not be wash d and scour d
then may i set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living
item she hath many nameless virtues
that s as much as to say bastard virtues that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names
close at the heels of her virtues
item she is not to be kiss d fasting in respect of her breath
well that fault may be mended with a breakfast
item she hath a sweet mouth
that makes amends for her sour breath
item she doth talk in her sleep
it s no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk
item she is slow in words
o villain that set this down among her vices
to be slow in words is a woman s only virtue
i pray thee out with t and place it for her chief virtue
out with that too it was eve s legacy and cannot be ta en from her
i care not for that neither because i love crusts
well the best is she hath no teeth to bite
item she will often praise her liquor
if her liquor be good she shall if she will not i will for good things should be praised
of her tongue she cannot for that s writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that i ll keep shut
now of another thing she may and that cannot i help
item she hath more hair than wit and more faults than hairs and more wealth than faults
stop there i ll have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article
item she hath more hair than wit launce
it may be i ll prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less
and more faults than hairs launce
why that word makes the faults gracious
well i ll have her an if it be a match as nothing is impossible speed
why then will i tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the northgate
he hath stay d for a better man than thee
and must i go to him
thou must run to him for thou hast stay d so long that going will scarce serve the turn
why didst not tell me sooner
now will he be swing d for reading my letter
an unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets
i ll after to rejoice in the boy s correction
the duke s palace enter duke and thurio duke
sir thurio fear not but that she will love you now valentine is banish d from her sight
since his exile she hath despis d me most forsworn my company and rail d at me that i am desperate of obtaining her
this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice which with an hour s heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form
a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot
enter proteus how now sir proteus
is your countryman according to our proclamation gone
my daughter takes his going grievously
a little time my lord will kill that grief
so i believe but thurio thinks not so
proteus the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee
longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace
thou know st how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter
and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will
she did my lord when valentine was here
ay and perversely she persevers so
what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio
the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate
ay but she ll think that it is spoke in hate
ay if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend
then you must undertake to slander him
and that my lord i shall be loath to do tis an ill office for a gentleman especially against his very friend
where your good word cannot advantage him your slander never can endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend
you have prevail d my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him
but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio
therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine
and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine s report you are already love s firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind
upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friend s sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend
as much as i can do i will effect
but you sir thurio are not sharp enough you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes should be full fraught with serviceable vows
ay much is the force of heaven bred poesy
say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart write till your ink be dry and with your tears moist it again and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus lute was strung with poets sinews whose golden touch could soften steel and stones make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
after your dire lamenting elegies visit by night your lady s chamber window with some sweet consort to their instruments tune a deploring dump the night s dead silence will well become such sweet complaining grievance
this or else nothing will inherit her
this discipline shows thou hast been in love
and thy advice this night i ll put in practice therefore sweet proteus my direction giver let us into the city presently to sort some gentlemen well skill d in music
i have a sonnet that will serve the turn to give the onset to thy good advice
we ll wait upon your grace till after supper and afterward determine our proceedings
a forest enter certain outlaws first outlaw
fellows stand fast i see a passenger
if there be ten shrink not but down with em
enter valentine and speed third outlaw
stand sir and throw us that you have about ye if not we ll make you sit and rifle you
sir we are undone these are the villains that all the travellers do fear so much
that s not so sir we are your enemies
ay by my beard will we for he is a proper man
then know that i have little wealth to lose a man i am cross d with adversity my riches are these poor habiliments of which if you should here disfurnish me you take the sum and substance that i have
have you long sojourn d there
some sixteen months and longer might have stay d if crooked fortune had not thwarted me
what were you banish d thence
for that which now torments me to rehearse i kill d a man whose death i much repent but yet i slew him manfully in fight without false vantage or base treachery
why ne er repent it if it were done so
but were you banish d for so small a fault
i was and held me glad of such a doom
my youthful travel therein made me happy or else i often had been miserable
by the bare scalp of robin hood s fat friar this fellow were a king for our wild faction
master be one of them it s an honourable kind of thievery
tell us this have you anything to take to
know then that some of us are gentlemen such as the fury of ungovern d youth thrust from the company of awful men myself was from verona banished for practising to steal away a lady an heir and near allied unto the duke
and i from mantua for a gentleman who in my mood i stabb d unto the heart
and i for such like petty crimes as these
but to the purpose for we cite our faults that they may hold excus d our lawless lives and partly seeing you are beautified with goodly shape and by your own report a linguist and a man of such perfection as we do in our quality much want second outlaw
indeed because you are a banish d man therefore above the rest we parley to you
are you content to be our general to make a virtue of necessity and live as we do in this wilderness
wilt thou be of our consort
say ay and be the captain of us all
we ll do thee homage and be rul d by thee love thee as our commander and our king
but if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer d
i take your offer and will live with you provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers
no we detest such vile base practices
come go with us we ll bring thee to our crews and show thee all the treasure we have got which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose
outside the duke s palace under silvia s window enter proteus proteus
already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio
under the colour of commending him i have access my own love to prefer but silvia is too fair too true too holy to be corrupted with my worthless gifts
when i protest true loyalty to her she twits me with my falsehood to my friend when to her beauty i commend my vows she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i lov d and notwithstanding all her sudden quips the least whereof would quell a lover s hope yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love the more it grows and fawneth on her still
enter thurio and musicians but here comes thurio
now must we to her window and give some evening music to her ear
how now sir proteus are you crept before us
ay gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it cannot go
ay but i hope sir that you love not here
sir but i do or else i would be hence
i thank you for your own
now gentlemen let s tune and to it lustily awhile
enter at a distance host and julia in boy s clothes host
now my young guest methinks you re allycholly i pray you why is it
marry mine host because i cannot be merry
come we ll have you merry i ll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you ask d for
but shall i hear him speak
what is she that all our swains commend her
holy fair and wise is she the heaven such grace did lend her that she might admired be
is she kind as she is fair
love doth to her eyes repair to help him of his blindness and being help d inhabits there
then to silvia let us sing that silvia is excelling she excels each mortal thing upon the dull earth dwelling
to her let us garlands bring
how now are you sadder than you were before
you mistake the musician likes me not
how out of tune on the strings
not so but yet so false that he grieves my very heart strings
ay i would i were deaf it makes me have a slow heart
i perceive you delight not in music
not a whit when it jars so
hark what fine change is in the music
ay that change is the spite
you would have them always play but one thing
i would always have one play but one thing
but host doth this sir proteus that we talk on often resort unto this gentlewoman
i tell you what launce his man told me he lov d her out of all nick
gone to seek his dog which to morrow by his master s command he must carry for a present to his lady
peace stand aside the company parts
sir thurio fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels
exeunt thurio and musicians enter silvia above at her window proteus
madam good ev n to your ladyship
i thank you for your music gentlemen
one lady if you knew his pure heart s truth you would quickly learn to know him by his voice
sir proteus as i take it
sir proteus gentle lady and your servant
you have your wish my will is even this that presently you hie you home to bed
thou subtle perjur d false disloyal man think st thou i am so shallow so conceitless to be seduced by thy flattery that hast deceiv d so many with thy vows
return return and make thy love amends
for me by this pale queen of night i swear i am so far from granting thy request that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit and by and by intend to chide myself even for this time i spend in talking to thee
i grant sweet love that i did love a lady but she is dead
aside twere false if i should speak it for i am sure she is not buried
say that she be yet valentine thy friend survives to whom thyself art witness i am betroth d and art thou not asham d to wrong him with thy importunacy
i likewise hear that valentine is dead
and so suppose am i for in his grave assure thyself my love is buried
sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
go to thy lady s grave and call hers thence or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
madam if your heart be so obdurate vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love the picture that is hanging in your chamber to that i ll speak to that i ll sigh and weep for since the substance of your perfect self is else devoted i am but a shadow and to your shadow will i make true love
aside if twere a substance you would sure deceive it and make it but a shadow as i am
i am very loath to be your idol sir but since your falsehood shall become you well to worship shadows and adore false shapes send to me in the morning and i ll send it and so good rest
as wretches have o ernight that wait for execution in the morn
by my halidom i was fast asleep
pray you where lies sir proteus
trust me i think tis almost day
not so but it hath been the longest night that e er i watch d and the most heaviest
under silvia s window enter eglamour eglamour
this is the hour that madam silvia entreated me to call and know her mind there s some great matter she d employ me in
enter silvia above at her window silvia
your servant and your friend one that attends your ladyship s command
sir eglamour a thousand times good morrow
as many worthy lady to yourself
according to your ladyship s impose i am thus early come to know what service it is your pleasure to command me in
o eglamour thou art a gentleman think not i flatter for i swear i do not valiant wise remorseful well accomplish d
thou art not ignorant what dear good will i bear unto the banish d valentine nor how my father would enforce me marry vain thurio whom my very soul abhors
thyself hast lov d and i have heard thee say no grief did ever come so near thy heart as when thy lady and thy true love died upon whose grave thou vow dst pure chastity
sir eglamour i would to valentine to mantua where i hear he makes abode and for the ways are dangerous to pass i do desire thy worthy company upon whose faith and honour i repose
urge not my father s anger eglamour but think upon my grief a lady s grief and on the justice of my flying hence to keep me from a most unholy match which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
i do desire thee even from a heart as full of sorrows as the sea of sands to bear me company and go with me if not to hide what i have said to thee that i may venture to depart alone
madam i pity much your grievances which since i know they virtuously are plac d i give consent to go along with you recking as little what betideth me as much i wish all good befortune you
at friar patrick s cell where i intend holy confession
i will not fail your ladyship
under silvia s window enter launce with his dog launce
when a man s servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard one that i brought up of a puppy one that i sav d from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it
i have taught him even as one would say precisely thus i would teach a dog
i was sent to deliver him as a present to mistress silvia from my master and i came no sooner into the dining chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon s leg
o tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies
i would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things
if i had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did i think verily he had been hang d for t sure as i live he had suffer d for t
he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman like dogs under the duke s table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him
out with the dog says one what cur is that
says another whip him out says the third hang him up says the duke
i having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs
friend quoth i you mean to whip the dog
ay marry do i quoth he
you do him the more wrong quoth i twas i did the thing you wot of
he makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber
how many masters would do this for his servant
nay i ll be sworn i have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stol n otherwise he had been executed i have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill d otherwise he had suffer d for t
thou think st not of this now
nay i remember the trick you serv d me when i took my leave of madam silvia
did not i bid thee still mark me and do as i do
when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman s farthingale
didst thou ever see me do such a trick
enter proteus and julia in boy s clothes proteus
i like thee well and will employ thee in some service presently
in what you please i ll do what i can
to launce how now you whoreson peasant
where have you been these two days loitering
marry sir i carried mistress silvia the dog you bade me
and what says she to my little jewel
marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present
but she receiv d my dog
no indeed did she not here have i brought him back again
what didst thou offer her this from me
ay sir the other squirrel was stol n from me by the hangman s boys in the market place and then i offer d her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greater
go get thee hence and find my dog again or ne er return again into my sight
stayest thou to vex me here
exit launce a slave that still an end turns me to shame
sebastian i have entertained thee partly that i have need of such a youth that can with some discretion do my business for tis no trusting to yond foolish lout but chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour which if my augury deceive me not witness good bringing up fortune and truth therefore know thou for this i entertain thee
go presently and take this ring with thee deliver it to madam silvia she lov d me well deliver d it to me
it seems you lov d not her to leave her token
not so i think she lives
i cannot choose but pity her
because methinks that she lov d you as well as you do love your lady silvia
she dreams on him that has forgot her love you dote on her that cares not for your love
tis pity love should be so contrary and thinking on it makes me cry alas
well give her that ring and therewithal this letter
tell my lady i claim the promise for her heavenly picture
your message done hie home unto my chamber where thou shalt find me sad and solitary
how many women would do such a message
alas poor proteus thou hast entertain d a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
alas poor fool why do i pity him that with his very heart despiseth me
because he loves her he despiseth me because i love him i must pity him
this ring i gave him when he parted from me to bind him to remember my good will and now am i unhappy messenger to plead for that which i would not obtain to carry that which i would have refus d to praise his faith which i would have disprais d
i am my master s true confirmed love but cannot be true servant to my master unless i prove false traitor to myself
yet will i woo for him but yet so coldly as heaven it knows i would not have him speed
enter silvia attended gentlewoman good day
i pray you be my mean to bring me where to speak with madam silvia
what would you with her if that i be she
if you be she i do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message i am sent on
from my master sir proteus madam
o he sends you for a picture
tell him from me one julia that his changing thoughts forget would better fit his chamber than this shadow
madam please you peruse this letter
pardon me madam i have unadvis d deliver d you a paper that i should not
this is the letter to your ladyship
i pray thee let me look on that again
it may not be good madam pardon me
i will not look upon your master s lines
i know they are stuff d with protestations and full of new found oaths which he wul break as easily as i do tear his paper
madam he sends your ladyship this ring
the more shame for him that he sends it me for i have heard him say a thousand times his julia gave it him at his departure
though his false finger have profan d the ring mine shall not do his julia so much wrong
i thank you madam that you tender her
poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
almost as well as i do know myself
to think upon her woes i do protest that i have wept a hundred several times
belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her
i think she doth and that s her cause of sorrow
she hath been fairer madam than she is
when she did think my master lov d her well she in my judgment was as fair as you but since she did neglect her looking glass and threw her sun expelling mask away the air hath starv d the roses in her cheeks and pinch d the lily tincture of her face that now she is become as black as i silvia
about my stature for at pentecost when all our pageants of delight were play d our youth got me to play the woman s part and i was trimm d in madam julia s gown which served me as fit by all men s judgments as if the garment had been made for me therefore i know she is about my height
and at that time i made her weep a good for i did play a lamentable part
madam twas ariadne passioning for theseus perjury and unjust flight which i so lively acted with my tears that my poor mistress moved therewithal wept bitterly and would i might be dead if i in thought felt not her very sorrow
she is beholding to thee gentle youth
alas poor lady desolate and left
i weep myself to think upon thy words
here youth there is my purse i give thee this for thy sweet mistress sake because thou lov st her
and she shall thank you for t if e er you know her
a virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
i hope my master s suit will be but cold since she respects my mistress love so much
alas how love can trifle with itself
here is her picture let me see
i think if i had such a tire this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers and yet the painter flatter d her a little unless i flatter with myself too much
her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love i ll get me such a colour d periwig
her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine ay but her forehead s low and mine s as high
what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself if this fond love were not a blinded god
come shadow come and take this shadow up for tis thy rival
o thou senseless form thou shalt be worshipp d kiss d lov d and ador d
and were there sense in his idolatry my substance should be statue in thy stead
i ll use thee kindly for thy mistress sake that us d me so or else by jove i vow i should have scratch d out your unseeing eyes to make my master out of love with thee
exit act v scene i milan
the sun begins to gild the western sky and now it is about the very hour that silvia at friar patrick s cell should meet me
she will not fail for lovers break not hours unless it be to come before their time so much they spur their expedition
enter silvia see where she comes
go on good eglamour out at the postern by the abbey wall i fear i am attended by some spies
the forest is not three leagues off if we recover that we are sure enough
the duke s palace enter thurio proteus and julia as sebastian thurio
sir proteus what says silvia to my suit
o sir i find her milder than she was and yet she takes exceptions at your person
what that my leg is too long
no that it is too little
i ll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder
aside but love will not be spurr d to what it loathes
what says she to my face
she says it is a fair one
nay then the wanton lies my face is black
but pearls are fair and the old saying is black men are pearls in beauteous ladies eyes
aside tis true such pearls as put out ladies eyes for i had rather wink than look on them
ill when you talk of war
but well when i discourse of love and peace
aside but better indeed when you hold your peace
what says she to my valour
o sir she makes no doubt of that
aside she needs not when she knows it cowardice
what says she to my birth
that you are well deriv d
aside true from a gentleman to a fool
aside that such an ass should owe them
that they are out by lease
which of you saw sir eglamour of late
why then she s fled unto that peasant valentine and eglamour is in her company
tis true for friar lawrence met them both as he in penance wander d through the forest him he knew well and guess d that it was she but being mask d he was not sure of it besides she did intend confession at patrick s cell this even and there she was not
these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence therefore i pray you stand not to discourse but mount you presently and meet with me upon the rising of the mountain foot that leads toward mantua whither they are fled
dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me
why this it is to be a peevish girl that flies her fortune when it follows her
i ll after more to be reveng d on eglamour than for the love of reckless silvia
and i will follow more for silvia s love than hate of eglamour that goes with her
and i will follow more to cross that love than hate for silvia that is gone for love
the forest enter outlaws with silva first outlaw
be patient we must bring you to our captain
a thousand more mischances than this one have learn d me how to brook this patiently
where is the gentleman that was with her
being nimble footed he hath outrun us but moyses and valerius follow him
go thou with her to the west end of the wood there is our captain we ll follow him that s fled
the thicket is beset he cannot scape
come i must bring you to our captain s cave fear not he bears an honourable mind and will not use a woman lawlessly
o valentine this i endure for thee
another part of the forest enter valentine valentine
how use doth breed a habit in a man
this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns
here can i sit alone unseen of any and to the nightingale s complaining notes tune my distresses and record my woes
o thou that dost inhabit in my breast leave not the mansion so long tenantless lest growing ruinous the building fall and leave no memory of what it was
repair me with thy presence silvia thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
what halloing and what stir is this to day
these are my mates that make their wills their law have some unhappy passenger in chase
they love me well yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages
steps aside enter proteus silvia and julia as sebastian proteus
madam this service i have done for you though you respect not aught your servant doth to hazard life and rescue you from him that would have forc d your honour and your love
vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look a smaller boon than this i cannot beg and less than this i am sure you cannot give
aside how like a dream is this i see and hear
love lend me patience to forbear awhile
o miserable unhappy that i am
unhappy were you madam ere i came but by my coming i have made you happy
by thy approach thou mak st me most unhappy
aside and me when he approacheth to your presence
had i been seized by a hungry lion i would have been a breakfast to the beast rather than have false proteus rescue me
o heaven be judge how i love valentine whose life s as tender to me as my soul
and full as much for more there cannot be i do detest false perjur d proteus
therefore be gone solicit me no more
what dangerous action stood it next to death would i not undergo for one calm look
o tis the curse in love and still approv d when women cannot love where they re belov d
when proteus cannot love where he s belov d
read over julia s heart thy first best love for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths and all those oaths descended into perjury to love me
thou hast no faith left now unless thou dst two and that s far worse than none better have none than plural faith which is too much by one
thou counterfeit to thy true friend
nay if the gentle spirit of moving words can no way change you to a milder form i ll woo you like a soldier at arms end and love you gainst the nature of love force ye
i ll force thee yield to my desire
let go that rude uncivil touch thou friend of an ill fashion
thou common friend that s without faith or love for such is a friend now treacherous man thou hast beguil d my hopes nought but mine eye could have persuaded me
now i dare not say i have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
who should be trusted when one s own right hand is perjured to the bosom
proteus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake
mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst
my shame and guilt confounds me
forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence i tender t here i do as truly suffer as e er i did commit
then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest
who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleas d by penitence th eternal s wrath s appeas d
and that my love may appear plain and free all that was mine in silvia i give thee
o good sir my master charg d me to deliver a ring to madam silvia which out of my neglect was never done
why this is the ring i gave to julia
o cry you mercy sir i have mistook this is the ring you sent to silvia
but how cam st thou by this ring
at my depart i gave this unto julia
and julia herself did give it me and julia herself have brought it hither
behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths and entertain d em deeply in her heart
how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
o proteus let this habit make thee blush
be thou asham d that i have took upon me such an immodest raiment if shame live in a disguise of love
it is the lesser blot modesty finds women to change their shapes than men their minds
o heaven were man but constant he were perfect
that one error fills him with faults makes him run through all th sins inconstancy falls off ere it begins
what is in silvia s face but i may spy more fresh in julia s with a constant eye
come come a hand from either
let me be blest to make this happy close twere pity two such friends should be long foes
bear witness heaven i have my wish for ever
enter outlaws with duke and thurio outlaw
a prize a prize a prize
forbear forbear i say it is my lord the duke
your grace is welcome to a man disgrac d banished valentine
yonder is silvia and silvia s mine
thurio give back or else embrace thy death come not within the measure of my wrath do not name silvia thine if once again verona shall not hold thee
here she stands take but possession of her with a touch i dare thee but to breathe upon my love
sir valentine i care not for her i i hold him but a fool that will endanger his body for a girl that loves him not
i claim her not and therefore she is thine
the more degenerate and base art thou to make such means for her as thou hast done and leave her on such slight conditions
now by the honour of my ancestry i do applaud thy spirit valentine and think thee worthy of an empress love
know then i here forget all former griefs cancel all grudge repeal thee home again plead a new state in thy unrivall d merit to which i thus subscribe sir valentine thou art a gentleman and well deriv d take thou thy silvia for thou hast deserv d her
i thank your grace the gift hath made me happy
i now beseech you for your daughter s sake to grant one boon that i shall ask of you
i grant it for thine own whate er it be
these banish d men that i have kept withal are men endu d with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recall d from their exile they are reformed civil full of good and fit for great employment worthy lord
thou hast prevail d i pardon them and thee dispose of them as thou know st their deserts
come let us go we will include all jars with triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
and as we walk along i dare be bold with our discourse to make your grace to smile
what think you of this page my lord
i think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
i warrant you my lord more grace than boy

set downe in yce which by hot greefe uncandied melts into drops so sorrow wanting forme is prest with deeper matter
pray stand up your greefe is written in your cheeke
o woe you cannot reade it there there through my teares— like wrinckled peobles in a glassie streame you may behold em
lady lady alacke he that will all the treasure know o th earth must know the center too he that will fish for my least minnow let him lead his line to catch one at my heart
o pardon me extremity that sharpens sundry wits makes me a foole
pray you say nothing pray you who cannot feele nor see the raine being in t knowes neither wet nor dry if that you were the ground peece of some painter i would buy you t instruct me gainst a capitall greefe indeed— such heart peirc d demonstration but alas being a naturall sifter of our sex your sorrow beates so ardently upon me that it shall make a counter reflect gainst my brothers heart and warme it to some pitty though it were made of stone pray have good comfort
forward to th temple leave not out a iot o th sacred ceremony
o this celebration will long last and be more costly then your suppliants war remember that your fame knowles in the eare o th world what you doe quickly is not done rashly your first thought is more then others laboured meditance your premeditating more then their actions but oh iove
your actions soone as they mooves as asprayes doe the fish subdue before they touch thinke deere duke thinke what beds our slaine kings have
what greifes our beds that our deere lords have none
none fit for th dead those that with cordes knives drams precipitance weary of this worlds light have to themselves beene deathes most horrid agents humaine grace affords them dust and shaddow
but our lords ly blistring fore the visitating sunne and were good kings when living
it is true and i will give you comfort to give your dead lords graves the which to doe must make some worke with creon
and that worke presents it selfe to th doing now twill take forme the heates are gone to morrow
then booteles toyle must recompence it selfe with it s owne sweat now he s secure not dreames we stand before your puissance wrinching our holy begging in our eyes to make petition cleere
now you may take him drunke with his victory
and his army full of bread and sloth
artesius that best knowest how to draw out fit to this enterprise the prim st for this proceeding and the number to carry such a businesse forth and levy our worthiest instruments whilst we despatch this grand act of our life this daring deede of fate in wedlocke
dowagers take hands let us be widdowes to our woes delay commends us to a famishing hope
we come unseasonably but when could greefe cull forth as unpanged judgement can fit st time for best solicitation
why good ladies this is a service whereto i am going greater then any was it more imports me then all the actions that i have foregone or futurely can cope
the more proclaiming our suit shall be neglected when her armes able to locke iove from a synod shall by warranting moone light corslet thee oh when her twyning cherries shall their sweetnes fall vpon thy tastefull lips what wilt thou thinke of rotten kings or blubberd queenes what care for what thou feelst not
what thou feelst being able to make mars spurne his drom
o if thou couch but one night with her every howre in t will take hostage of thee for a hundred and thou shalt remember nothing more then what that banket bids thee too
you should be so transported as much sorry i should be such a suitour yet i thinke did i not by th abstayning of my joy which breeds a deeper longing cure their surfeit that craves a present medcine i should plucke all ladies scandall on me
therefore sir as i shall here make tryall of my prayres either presuming them to have some force or sentencing for ay their vigour dombe prorogue this busines we are going about and hang your sheild afore your heart about that necke which is my ffee and which i freely lend to doe these poore queenes service
oh helpe now our cause cries for your knee
my sister her petition in that force with that celerity and nature which shee makes it in from henceforth ile not dare to aske you any thing nor be so hardy ever to take a husband
i am entreating of my selfe to doe that which you kneele to have me
pyrithous leade on the bride get you and pray the gods for successe and returne omit not any thing in the pretended celebration
as before hence you to artesius and at the banckes of aulis meete us with the forces you can raise where we shall finde the moytie of a number for a busines more bigger look t
since that our theame is haste i stamp this kisse upon thy currant lippe sweete keepe it as my token
set you forward for i will see you gone
farewell my beauteous sister pyrithous keepe the feast full bate not an howre on t
sir ile follow you at heeles the feasts solempnity shall want till your returne
cosen i charge you boudge not from athens we shall be returning ere you can end this feast of which i pray you make no abatement once more farewell all
thus do st thou still make good the tongue o th world
and earnst a deity equal with mars
if not above him for thou being but mortall makest affections bend to godlike honours they themselves some say grone under such a mastry
as we are men thus should we doe being sensually subdude we loose our humane tytle
now turne we towards your comforts
deere palamon deerer in love then blood and our prime cosen yet unhardned in the crimes of nature let us leave the citty thebs and the temptings in t before we further sully our glosse of youth and here to keepe in abstinence we shame as in incontinence for not to swim i th aide o th current were almost to sincke at least to frustrate striving and to follow the common streame twold bring us to an edy where we should turne or drowne if labour through our gaine but life and weakenes
your advice is cride up with example what strange ruins since first we went to schoole may we perceive walking in thebs
skars and bare weedes the gaine o th martialist who did propound to his bold ends honour and golden ingots which though he won he had not and now flurted by peace for whom he fought who then shall offer to marsis so scornd altar
i doe bleede when such i meete and wish great iuno would resume her ancient fit of ielouzie to get the soldier worke that peace might purge for her repletion and retaine anew her charitable heart now hard and harsher then strife or war could be
meete you no ruine but the soldier in the cranckes and turnes of thebs
you did begin as if you met decaies of many kindes perceive you none that doe arowse your pitty but th un considerd soldier
yes i pitty decaies where ere i finde them but such most that sweating in an honourable toyle are paide with yce to coole em
tis not this i did begin to speake of this is vertue of no respect in thebs i spake of thebs how dangerous if we will keepe our honours it is for our resyding where every evill hath a good cullor where eve ry seeming good s a certaine evill where not to be ev n iumpe as they are here were to be strangers and such things to be meere monsters
tis in our power vnlesse we feare that apes can tutor s to be masters of our manners what neede i affect anothers gate which is not catching where there is faith or to be fond upon anothers way of speech when by mine owne i may be reasonably conceiv d sav d too speaking it truly
why am i bound by any generous bond to follow him followes his taylor haply so long untill the follow d make pursuit
or let me know why mine owne barber is unblest with him my poore chinne too for tis not cizard iust to such a favorites glasse what cannon is there that does command my rapier from my hip to dangle t in my hand or to go tip toe before the streete be foule
either i am the fore horse in the teame or i am none that draw i th sequent trace these poore sleight sores neede not a plantin that which rips my bosome almost to th heart s— arcite
he a most unbounded tyrant whose successes makes heaven unfeard and villany assured beyond its power there s nothing almost puts faith in a feavour and deifies alone voluble chance who onely attributes the faculties of other instruments to his owne nerves and act commands men service and what they winne in t boot and glory on e that feares not to do harm good dares not let the blood of mine that s sibbe to him be suckt from me with leeches let them breake and fall off me with that corruption
cleere spirited cozen lets leave his court that we may nothing share of his lowd infamy for our milke will relish of the pasture and we must be vile or disobedient not his kinesmen in blood unlesse in quality
nothing truer i thinke the ecchoes of his shames have dea ft the eares of heav nly iustice widdows cryes descend againe into their throates and have not enter valerius
due audience of the gods —valerius
the king cals for you yet be leaden footed till his great rage be off him
phebus when he broke his whipstocke and exclaimd against the horses of the sun but whisperd too the lowdenesse of his fury
small windes shake him but whats the matter
theseus who where he threates appals hath sent deadly defyance to him and pronounces ruine to thebs who is at hand to seale the promise of his wrath
let him approach but that we feare the gods in him he brings not a jot of terrour to us yet what man thirds his owne worth the case is each of ours when that his actions dregd with minde assurd tis bad he goes about
our services stand now for thebs not creon yet to be neutrall to him were dishonour rebellious to oppose therefore we must with him stand to the mercy of our fate who hath bounded our last minute
ist sed this warres a foote
or it shall be on faile of some condition
tis in motion the intelligence of state came in the instant with the defier
lets to the king who were he a quarter carrier of that honour which his enemy come in the blood we venture should be as for our health which were not spent rather laide out for purchase but alas our hands advanc d before our hearts what will the fall o th stroke doe damage
let th event that never erring arbitratour tell us when we know all our selves and let us follow the becking of our chance
sir farewell repeat my wishes to our great lord of whose succes i dare not make any timerous question yet i wish him exces and overflow of power and t might be to dure ill dealing fortune speede to him store never hurtes good gouernours
though i know his ocean needes not my poore drops yet they must yeild their tribute there
my precious maide those best affections that the heavens infuse in their best temperd peices keepe enthroand in your deare heart
remember me to our all royall brother for whose speede the great bellona ile sollicite and since in our terrene state petitions are not without giftes understood ile offer to her what i shall be advised she likes our hearts are in his army in his tent
in s bosome we have bin soldiers and wee cannot weepe when our friends don their helmes or put to sea or tell of babes broachd on the launce or women that have sod their infants in and after eate them the brine they wept at killing em then if you stay to see of us such spincsters we should hold you here for ever
peace be to you as i pursue this war which shall be then beyond further requiring
how his longing followes his friend
since his depart his sportes though craving seriousnes and skill past slightly his careles execution where nor gaine made him regard or losse consider but playing one busines in his hand another directing in his head his minde nurse equall to these so diffring twyns—have you observ d him since our great lord departed
with much labour and i did love him fort they two have cabind in many as dangerous as poore a corner perill and want contending they have skift torrents whose roring tyranny and power i th least of these was dreadfull and they have fought out together where deaths selfe was lodgd yet fate hath brought them off their knot of love tide weau d intangled with so true so long and with a finger of so deepe a cunning may be outworne never undone
i thinke theseus cannot be umpire to himselfe cleaving his conscience into twaine and doing each side like iustice which he loves best
doubtlesse there is a best and reason has no manners to say it is not you i was acquainted once with a time when i enjoyd a play fellow you were at wars when she the grave enrichd who made too proud the bed tooke leave o th moone which then lookt pale at parting when our count was each eleven
you talke of pirithous and theseus love theirs has more ground is more maturely seasond more buckled with strong iudgement and their needes the one of th other may be said to water 2
hearses ready with palamon and arcite the 3
this rehearsall which ev ry innocent wots well comes in like old importments bastard has this end that the true love tweene mayde and mayde may be more then in sex idividuall
y are out of breath and this high speeded pace is but to say that you shall never like the maide flavina love any that s calld man
i am sure i shall not
now alacke weake sister i must no more beleeve thee in this point though in t i know thou dost beleeve thyselfe then i will trust a sickely appetite that loathes even as it longs but sure my sister if i were ripe for your perswasion you have saide enough to shake me from the arme of the all noble theseus for whose fortunes i will now in and kneele with great assurance that we more then his pirothous possesse the high throne in his heart
i am not against your faith yet i continew mine
dead bodies lying on the ground
a battaile strooke within then a retrait florish
then enter theseus victor herald and attendants the three queenes meete him and fall on their faces before him
to thee no starre be darke
both heaven and earth friend thee for ever
all the good that may be wishd upon thy head i cry amen too t
th imparciall gods who from the mounted heavens view us their mortall heard behold who erre and in their time chastice goe and finde out the bones of your dead lords and honour them with treble ceremonie rather then a gap should be in their deere rights we would supply t
but those we will depute which shall invest you in your dignities and even each thing our hast does leave imperfect so adiew and heavens good eyes looke on you
men of great quality as may be judgd by their appointment sone of thebs have told s they are sisters children nephewes to the king
by th helme of mars i saw them in the war like to a paire of lions smeard with prey make lanes in troopes agast
i fixt my note constantly on them for they were a marke worth a god s view what prisoner was t that told me when i enquired their names
wi leave they r called arcite and palamon
nor in a state of life had they bin taken when their last hurts were given twas possible 3
they might have bin recovered yet they breathe and haue the name of men
the very lees of such millions of rates exceede the wine of others all our surgions convent in their behoofe our richest balmes rather then niggard waft their lives concerne us much more then thebs is worth rather then have em freed of this plight and in their morning state sound and at liberty i would em dead but forty thousand fold we had rather have em prisoners to us then death
beare em speedily from our kinde aire to them unkinde and minister what man to man may doe—for our sake more since i have knowne frights fury friends beheastes loves provocations zeale a mistris taske desire of liberty a feavour madnes hath set a marke which nature could not reach too without some imposition sicknes in will or wrastling strength in reason
for our love and great appollos mercy all our best their best skill tender
leade into the citty where having bound things scatterd we will post florish
to athens for e our army exeunt
enter the queenes with the hearses of their knightes in a funerall solempnity c vrnes and odours bring away vapours sighes darken the day our dole more deadly lookes than dying balmes and gummes and heavy cheeres sacred vials fill d with teares and clamors through the wild ayre flying
come all sad and solempne showes that are quick eyd pleasures foes we convent nought else but woes
this funeral path brings to your housholds grave ioy ceaze on you againe peace sleepe with him
yours this way heavens lend a thousand differing waies to one sure end
this world s a citty full of straying streetes and death s the market place where each one meetes
a garden with a prison in the background
i may depart with little while i live some thing i may cast to you not much alas the prison i keepe though it be for great ones yet they seldome come before one salmon you shall take a number of minnowes
i am given out to be better lyn d then it can appeare to me report is a true speaker i would i were really that i am deliverd to be
marry what i have be it what it will i will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death
sir i demaund no more then your owne offer and i will estate your daughter in what i have promised
wel we will talke more of this when the solemnity is past
but have you a full promise of her
when that shall be seene i tender my consent
i have sir here shee comes
your friend and i have chanced to name you here upon the old busines but no more of that now so soone as the court hurry is over we will have an end of it i th meane time looke tenderly to the two prisoners
i can tell you they are princes
these strewings are for their chamber tis pitty they are in prison and twer pitty they should be out i doe thinke they have patience to make any adversity asham d the prison it selfe is proud of em and they have all the world in their chamber
they are fam d to be a paire of absolute men
by my troth i think fame but stammers em they stand a greise above the reach of report
i heard them reported in the battaile to be the only doers
nay most likely for they are noble suffrers i mervaile how they would have lookd had they beene victors that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedome out of bondage making misery their mirth and affliction a toy to jest at
it seemes to me they have no more sence of their captivity then i of ruling athens they eate well looke merrily discourse of many things but nothing of their owne restraint and disasters yet sometime a devided sigh martyrd as twer i th deliverance will breake from one of them when the other presently gives it so sweete a rebuke that i could wish my selfe a sigh to be so chid or at least a sigher to be comforted
the duke himselfe came privately in the night enter palamon and arcite above
and so did they what the reason of it is i know not looke yonder they are
no sir no that s palamon arcite is the lower of the twaine you may perceive a part of him
goe too leave your pointing they would not make us their object out of their sight
it is a holliday to looke on them lord the diffrence of men
the prison enter palamon and arcite in prison
why strong inough to laugh at misery and beare the chance of warre yet we are prisoners i feare for ever cosen
i beleeve it and to that destiny have patiently laide up my houre to come
o cosen arcite where is thebs now
where are our friends and kindreds
never more must we behold those comforts never see the hardy youthes strive for the games of honour hung with the painted favours of their ladies like tall ships under saile then start among st em and as an eastwind leave en all behinde us like lazy clowdes whilst palamon and arcite even in the wagging of a wanton leg out stript the peoples praises won the garlands ere they have time to wish em ours
o never shall we two exercise like twyns of honour our armes againe and feele our fyry horses like proud seas under us our good swords now better the red eyd god of war nev r wore ravishd our sides like age must run to rust and decke the temples of those gods that hate us these hands shall never draw em out like lightning to blast whole armies more
no palamon those hopes are prisoners with us here we are and here the graces of our youthes must wither like a too timely spring here age must finde us and which is heaviest palamon unmarried the sweete embraces of a loving wife loden with kisses armd with thousand cupids shall never claspe our neckes no issue know us no figures of our selves shall we ev r see to glad our age and like young eagles teach em boldly to gaze against bright armes and say remember what your fathers were and conquer
the faire eyd maides shall weepe our banishments and in their songs curse ever blinded fortune till shee for shame see what a wrong she has done to youth and nature
this is all our world we shall know nothing here but one another heare nothing but the clocke that tels our woes
the vine shall grow but we shall never see it sommer shall come and with her all delights but dead cold winter must inhabite here still
to our theban houndes that shooke the aged forrest with their ecchoes no more now must we halloa no more shake our pointed iavelyns whilst the angry swine flyes like a parthian quiver from our rages strucke with our well steeld darts all valiant uses the foode and nourishment of noble mindes in us two here shall perish we shall die which is the curse of honour lastly children of greife and ignorance
yet cosen even from the bottom of these miseries from all that fortune can inflict upon us i see two comforts rysing two meere blessings if the gods please to hold here a brave patience and the enjoying of our greefes together
whilst palamon is with me let me perish if i thinke this our prison
certeinly tis a maine goodnes cosen that our fortunes were twyn d together tis most true two soules put in two noble bodies—let em suffer the gaule of hazard so they grow together— will never sincke they must not say they could a willing man dies sleeping and all s done
shall we make worthy uses of this place that all men hate so much
let s thinke this prison holy sanctuary to keepe us from corruption of worse men
we are young and yet desire the waies of honour that liberty and common conversation the poyson of pure spirits might like women wooe us to wander from
what worthy blessing can be but our imaginations may make it ours
you have made me i thanke you cosen arcite almost wanton with my captivity what a misery it is to live abroade and every where
tis like a beast me thinkes i finde the court here— i am sure a more content and all those pleasures that wooe the wils of men to vanity i see through now and am sufficient to tell the world tis but a gaudy shaddow that old time as he passes by takes with him
what had we bin old in the court of creon where sin is iustice lust and ignorance the vertues of the great ones
cosen arcite had not the loving gods found this place for us we had died as they doe ill old men unwept and had their epitaphes the peoples curses shall i say more
is there record of any two that lov d better then we doe arcite
i doe not thinke it possible our friendship should ever leave us
till our deathes it cannot enter emilia and her woman below
and after death our spirits shall be led to those that love eternally
this garden has a world of pleasures in t
that was a faire boy certaine but a foole to love himselfe were there not maides enough
or were they all hard hearted
they could not be to one so faire
i thinke i should not madam
that s a good wench but take heede to your kindnes though
canst not thou worke such flowers in silke wench
ile have a gowne full of em and of these this is a pretty colour wilt not doe rarely upon a skirt wench
cosen cosen how doe you sir
never till now i was in prison arcite
by heaven shee is a goddesse
of all flowres me thinkes a rose is best
it is the very embleme of a maide
for when the west wind courts her gently how modestly she blowes and paints the sun with her chaste blushes
when the north comes neere her rude and impatient then like chastity shee lockes her beauties in her bud againe and leaves him to base briers
yet good madam sometimes her modesty will blow so far she fals for t a mayde if shee have any honour would be loth to take example by her
the sun grows high lets walk in keep these flowers weele see how neere art can come neere their colours
i am wondrous merry hearted i could laugh now
i could lie downe i am sure
that s as we bargaine madam
what thinke you of this beauty
is t but a rare one
might not a man well lose himselfe and love her
i cannot tell what you have done i have beshrew mine eyes for t now i feele my shackles
yes but you must not love her
i will not as you doe to worship her as she is heavenly and a blessed goddes i love her as a woman to enjoy her so both may love
you shall not love at all
i that first saw her i that tooke possession first with mine eyes of all those beauties in her reveald to mankinde if thou lou st her or entertain st a hope to blast my wishes thou art a traytour arcite and a fellow false as thy title to her friendship blood and all the tyes betweene us i disclaime if thou once thinke upon her
yes i love her and if the lives of all my name lay on it i must doe so i love her with my soule if that will lose ye farewell palamon i say againe i love and in loving her maintaine i am as worthy and as free a lover and have as just a title to her beauty as any palamon or any living that is a mans sonne
yes and have found me so why are you mov d thus
let me deale coldly with you am not i part of your blood part of your soule
you have told me that i was palamon and you were arcite
am not i liable to those affections those joyes greifes angers feares my friend shall suffer
why then would you deale so cunningly so strangely so vnlike a noble kinesman to love alone
speake truely doe you thinke me vnworthy of her sight
no but unjust if thou pursue that sight
because an other first sees the enemy shall i stand still and let mine honour downe and never charge
yes if he be but one
but say that one had rather combat me
let that one say so and use thy freedome els if thou pursuest her be as that cursed man that hates his country a branded villaine
i must be till thou art worthy arcite it concernes me and in this madnes if i hazard thee and take thy life i deale but truely
fie sir you play the childe extreamely i will love her i must i ought to doe so and i dare and all this justly
o that now that now thy false selfe and thy friend had but this fortune to be one howre at liberty and graspe our good swords in our hands
i would quickly teach thee what twer to filch affection from another thou art baser in it then a cutpurse put but thy head out of this window more and as i have a soule ile naile thy life too t
thou dar st not foole thou canst not thou art feeble
ile throw my body out and leape the garden when i see her next enter keeper
and pitch between her armes to anger thee
no more the keeper s comming i shall live to knocke thy braines out with my shackles
lord arcite you must presently to th duke the cause i know not yet
prince palamon i must awhile bereave you of your faire cosens company
and me too even when you please of life
it may be he shall marry her he s goodly and like enough the duke hath taken notice both of his blood and body but his falsehood
why should a friend be treacherous
if that get him a wife so noble and so faire let honest men ne re love againe
once more i would but see this faire one
blessed garden and fruite and flowers more blessed that still blossom as her bright eies shine on ye
would i were for all the fortune of my life hereafter yon little tree yon blooming apricocke how i would spread and fling my wanton armes in at her window i would bring her fruite fit for the gods to feed on youth and pleasure still as she tasted should be doubled on her and if she be not heavenly i would make her so neere the gods in nature they should feare her enter keeper
and then i am sure she would love me
banishd prince pirithous obtained his liberty but never more vpon his oth and life must he set foote vpon this kingdome
he shall see thebs againe and call to armes the bold yong men that when he bids em charge fall on like fire arcite shall have a fortune if he dare make himselfe a worthy lover yet in the feild to strike a battle for her and if he lose her then he s a cold coward how bravely may he beare himselfe to win her if he be noble arcite—thousand waies
were i at liberty i would doe things of such a vertuous greatnes that this lady this blushing virgine should take manhood to her and seeke to ravish me
my lord for you i have this charge too— palamon
no but from this place to remoove your lordship the windowes are too open
devils take em that are so envious to me
by this good light had i a sword i would kill thee
thou bringst such pelting scuruy news continually thou art not worthy life
then i am resolud i will not goe
i must constraine you then and for you are dangerous ile clap more yrons on you
ile shake em so ye shall not sleepe ile make ye a new morrisse must i goe
may rude winde never hurt thee
o my lady if ever thou hast felt what sorrow was dreame how i suffer
tis a benefit a mercy i must thanke em for but banishd the free enjoying of that face i die for oh twas a studdied punishment a death beyond imagination such a vengeance that were i old and wicked all my sins could never plucke upon me
palamon thou ha st the start now thou shalt stay and see her bright eyes breake each morning gainst thy window and let in life into thee thou shalt feede vpon the sweetenes of a noble beauty that nature nev r exceeded nor nev r shall good gods
twenty to one hee le come to speake to her and if she be as gentle as she s faire i know she s his he has a tongue will tame tempests and make the wild rockes wanton
come what can come the worst is death i will not leave the kingdome
i know mine owne is but a heape of ruins and no redresse there if i goe he has her
i am resolu d an other shape shall make me or end my fortunes
either way i am happy ile see her and be neere her or no more

wilt thou exceede in all or do st thou doe it to make me spare thee
if you thinke so cosen you are deceived for as i am a soldier i will not spare you

i never saw such valour when you chargd vpon the left wing of the enemie i spurd hard to come up and under me i had a right good horse
you had indeede a bright bay i remember
yes but all was vainely labour d in me you outwent me nor could my wishes reach you yet a little i did by imitation
more by vertue you are modest cosen
when i saw you charge first me thought i heard a dreadfull clap of thunder breake from the troope
but still before that flew the lightning of your valour

if we be found we are wretched
o retire for honours sake and safety presently into your bush agen sir we shall finde too many howres to dye in gentle cosen if you be seene you perish instantly for breaking prison and i if you reveale me for my contempt
then all the world will scorne us and say we had a noble difference but base disposers of it
no no cosen i will no more be hidden nor put off this great adventure to a second tryall i know your cunning and i know your cause he that faints now shame take him put thyselfe vpon thy present guard— arcite
or i will make th advantage of this howre mine owne and what to come shall threaten me i feare lesse then my fortune know weake cosen i love emilia and in that ile bury thee and all crosses else
then come what can come thou shalt know palamon i dare as well die as discourse or sleepe onely this feares me the law will have the honour of our ends
looke to thine owne well arcite
enter theseus hipolita emilia perithous and traine
what ignorant and mad malicious traitors are you that gainst the tenor of my lawes are making battaile thus like knights appointed without my leave and officers of armes
this treacherie like a most trusty lover i call d him now to answer if thou bee st as thou art spoken great and vertuous the true descider of all injuries say fight againe and thou shalt see me theseus doe such a iustice thou thyselfe wilt envie
then take my life ile wooe thee too t
o heaven what more then man is this
we seeke not thy breath of mercy theseus
tis to me a thing as soone to dye as thee to say it and no more mov d where this man calls me traitor let me say thus much if in love be treason in service of so excellent a beutie as i love most and in that faith will perish as i have brought my life here to confirme it as i have serv d her truest worthiest as i dare kill this cosen that denies it so let me be most traitor and ye please me
for scorning thy edict duke aske that lady why she is faire and why her eyes command me stay here to love her and if she say traytor i am a villaine fit to lye unburied
thou shalt have pitty of us both o theseus if unto neither thou shew mercy stop as thou art just thy noble eare against us
as thou art valiant for thy cosens soule whose 12 strong labours crowne his memory lets die together at one instant duke onely a little let him fall before me that i may tell my soule he shall not have her
i grant your wish for to say true your cosen has ten times more offended for i gave him more mercy then you found sir your offenses being no more then his
none here speake for em for ere the sun set both shall sleepe for ever
now or never sister speake not to be denide that face of yours will beare the curses else of after ages for these lost cosens
in my face deare sister i finde no anger to em nor no ruyn the misadventure of their owne eyes kill em yet that i will be woman and have pitty my knees shall grow to th ground but ile get mercie
helpe me deare sister in a deede so vertuous the powers of all women will be with us
sir by our tye of marriage— emilia
by your owne spotlesse honour— hippolita
by that faith that faire hand and that honest heart you gave me
by that you would have pitty in another by your owne vertues infinite
by valour by all the chaste nights i have ever pleasd you
nay then ile in too by all our friendship sir by all our dangers by all you love most warres and this sweet lady
by that you would have trembled to deny a blushing maide
by your owne eyes by strength in which you swore i went beyond all women almost all men and yet i yeelded theseus
to crowne all this by your most noble soule which cannot want due mercie i beg first
ye make my faith reele say i felt compassion to em both how would you place it
vpon their lives but with their banishments
you are a right woman sister you have pitty but want the vnderstanding where to use it
if you desire their lives invent a way safer then banishment can these two live and have the agony of love about em and not kill one another
every day they ld fight about you howrely bring your honour in publique question with their swords
be wise then and here forget em it concernes your credit and my oth equally i have said they die better they fall by th law then one another
o my noble brother that oth was rashly made and in your anger your reason will not hold it if such vowes stand for expresse will all the world must perish
beside i have another oth gainst yours of more authority i am sure more love not made in passion neither but good heede
that you would nev r deny me any thing fit for my modest suit and your free granting i tye you to your word now if ye fall in t thinke how you maime your honour for now i am set a begging sir i am deafe to all but your compassion
how their lives might breed the ruine of my name opinion
shall any thing that loves me perish for me
that were a cruell wisedome doe men proyne the straight yong bowes that blush with thousand blossoms because they may be rotten
o duke theseus the goodly mothers that have groand for these and all the longing maides that ever lov d if your vow stand shall curse me and my beauty and in their funerall songs for these two cosens despise my crueltie and cry woe worth me till i am nothing but the scorne of women for heavens sake save their lives and banish em
sweare em never more to make me their contention or to know me to tread upon thy dukedome and to be where ever they shall travel ever strangers to one another
ile be cut a peeces before i take this oth forget i love her
o all ye gods dispise me then
thy banishment i not mislike so we may fairely carry our swords and cause along else never trifle but take our lives duke i must love and will and for that love must and dare kill this cosen on any peece the earth has
will you arcite take these conditions
no never duke tis worse to me than begging to take my life so basely though i thinke i never shall enjoy her yet ile preserve the honour of affection and dye for her make death a devill
let it not fall agen sir
say emilia if one of them were dead as one must are you content to take th other to your husband
they cannot both enjoy you they are princes as goodly as your owne eyes and as noble as ever fame yet spoke of looke upon em and if you can love end this difference
i give consent are you content too princes
he that she refuses must dye then
any death thou canst invent duke
if i fall from that mouth i fall with favour and lovers yet unborne shall blesse my ashes
if she refuse me yet my grave will wed me and souldiers sing my epitaph
i cannot sir they are both too excellent for me a hayre shall never fall of these men
thus i ordaine it and by mine honor once againe it stands or both shall dye —you shall both to your countrey and each within this moneth accompanied with three faire knights appeare againe in this place in which ile plant a pyramid and whether before us that are here can force his cosen by fayre and knightly strength to touch the pillar he shall enjoy her the other loose his head and all his friends nor shall he grudge to fall nor thinke he dies with interest in this lady will this content yee
yes here cosen arcite i am friends againe till that howre
yes i must sir els both miscarry
come shake hands againe then and take heede as you are gentlemen this quarrell sleepe till the howre prefixt and hold your course
we dare not faile thee theseus
come ile give ye now usage like to princes and to friends when ye returne who wins ile settle heere who looses yet ile weepe upon his beere
was nothing saide of me concerning the escape of palamon
nothing that i heard for i came home before the busines was fully ended yet i might perceive ere i departed a great likelihood of both their pardons for hipolita and faire eyd emilie upon their knees begd with such hansom pitty that the duke me thought stood staggering whether he should follow his rash oth or the sweet compassion of those two ladies and to second them that truely noble prince perithous halfe his owne heart set in too that i hope all shall be well neither heard i one question of your name or his scape
be of good comfort man i bring you newes good newes
palamon has cleerd you and got your pardon and discoverd how and by whose meanes he escapt which was your daughters whose pardon is procurd too and the prisoner not to be held ungratefull to her goodnes has given a summe of money to her marriage a large one ile assure you
ye are a good man and ever bring good newes
why as it should be they that nev r begd but they prevaild had their suites fairely granted the prisoners have their lives
i knew t would be so
but there be new conditions which you l heare of at better time
they are honourable how good they l prove i know not
alas sir wher s your daughter
o sir when did you see her
i doe not thinke she was very well for now you make me minde her but this very day i ask d her questions and she answered me so farre from what she was so childishly so sillily as if she were a foole an inocent and i was very angry
nothing but my pitty but you must know it and as good by me as by an other that lesse loves her— iailor
tis too true she is mad
beleeve you l finde it so
i halfe suspected what you have told me the gods comfort her either this was her love to palamon or feare of my miscarrying on his scape or both
but why all this haste sir
as i late was angling in the great lake that lies behind the pallace from the far shore thicke set with reedes and sedges as patiently i was attending sport i heard a voyce a shrill one and attentive i gave my eare when i might well perceive t was one that sung and by the smallnesse of it a boy or woman
i then left my angle to his owne skill came neere but yet perceivd not who made the sound the rushes and the reeds had so encompast it i laide me downe and listned to the words she sung for then through a small glade cut by the fisher men i saw it was your daughter
she sung much but no sence onely i heard her repeat this often palamon is gone is gone to th wood to gather mulberies ile finde him out to morrow
his shackles will betray him hee l be taken and what shall i doe then
ile bring a beavy a hundred blacke eyd maides that love as i doe with chaplets on their heads of daffadillies with cherry lips and cheekes of damaske roses and all wee l daunce an antique fore the duke and beg his pardon
then she talk d of you sir that you must loose your head to morrow morning and she must gather flowers to bury you and see the house made handsome then she sung nothing but willow willow willow and betweene ever was palamon faire palamon and palamon was a tall yong man
she saw me and straight sought the flood i sav d her and set her safe to land when presently she slipt away and to the citty made with such a cry and swiftnes that beleeve me shee left me farre behinde her three or foure i saw from farre off crosse her one of em i knew to be your brother where she staid and fell scarce to be got away i left them with her enter brother daughter and others
and hether came to tell you
may you never more enjoy the light c is not this a fine song
yes truely can i i can sing the broome and bony robin
doe very rarely i must be abroad else to call the maides and pay the minstrels for i must loose my maydenhead by cock light twill never thrive else
o faire oh sweete c brother
you must ev n take it patiently
good ev n good men pray did you ever heare of one yong palamon
is t not a fine yong gentleman
by no meane crosse her she is then distemperd far worse then now she showes
yes he s a fine man
but she shall never have him tell her so for a tricke that i know y had best looke to her for if she see him once she s gone she s done and undon in an howre
all the young maydes of our towne are in love with him but i laugh at em and let em all alone is t not a wise course
there is at least two hundred now with child by him— there must be fowre yet i keepe close for all this close as a cockle and all these must be boyes he has the tricke on t and at ten yeares old they must be all gelt for musitians and sing the wars of theseus
as ever you heard but say nothing
they come from all parts of the dukedome to him ile warrant ye he had not so few last night as twenty to dispatch hee l tickl t up in two howres if his hand be in
she s lost past all cure
come hither you are a wise man
you are master of a ship
and now direct your course to th wood wher palamon lyes longing for me for the tackling let me alone come waygh my hearts cheerely
owgh owgh owgh tis up the wind s faire top the bowling out with the maine saile wher s your whistle master
beare for it master take about
when cinthia with her borrowed light c
yet i may binde those wounds up that must open and bleed to death for my sake else ile choose and end their strife two such yong hansom men shall never fall for me their weeping mothers following the dead cold ashes of their sonnes shall never curse my cruelty
good heaven what a sweet face has arcite
if wise nature with all her best endowments all those beuties she sowes into the birthes of noble bodies were here a mortall woman and had in her the coy denialls of yong maydes yet doubtles she would run mad for this man what an eye of what a fyry sparkle and quick sweetnes has this yong prince
here love himselfe sits smyling iust such another wanton ganimead set jove a fire with and enforcd the god snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him a shining constellation what a brow of what a spacious majesty he carries
arch d like the great eyd iuno s but far sweeter smoother then pelops shoulder
fame and honour me thinks from hence as from a promontory pointed in heaven should clap their wings and sing to all the under world the loves and fights of gods and such men neere em
palamon is but his foyle to him a meere dull shadow hee s swarth and meagre of an eye as heavy as if he had lost his mother a still temper no stirring in him no alacrity of all this sprightly sharpenes not a smile yet these that we count errours may become him narcissus was a sad boy but a heavenly — oh who can finde the bent of womans fancy
i am a foole my reason is lost in me i have no choice and i have ly d so lewdly that women ought to beate me
on my knees i aske thy pardon palamon thou art alone and only beutifull and these the eyes these the bright lamps of beauty that command and threaten love and what yong mayd dare crosse em
what a bold gravity and yet inviting has this browne manly face
o love this only from this howre is complexion lye there arcite thou art a changling to him a meere gipsey and this the noble bodie
i am sotted vtterly lost my virgins faith has fled me for if my brother but even now had ask d me whether i lov d i had run mad for arcite now if my sister more for palamon
stand both together now come aske me brother — alas i know not
aske me now sweet sister — i may goe looke
what a meere child is fancie that having two faire gawdes of equall sweetnesse cannot distinguish but must crie for both
from the noble duke your brother madam i bring you newes the knights are come
would i might end first what sinnes have i committed chast diana that my unspotted youth must now be soyld with blood of princes
and my chastitie be made the altar where the lives of lovers two greater and two better never yet made mothers joy must be the sacrifice to my unhappy beautie
enter theseus hipolita perithous and attendants
bring em in quickly by any meanes i long to see em — your two contending lovers are return d and with them their faire knights now my faire sister you must love one of them
i had rather both so neither for my sake should fall untimely
pray speake you that have seene them what they are
i will sir and truly what i thinke six braver spirits then these they have brought if we judge by the outside i never saw nor read of
thou ha st well describde him
yet a great deale short me thinkes of him that s first with palamon
and in his rowling eyes sits victory as if she ever ment to court his valour his nose stands high a character of honour
his red lips after fights are fit for ladies
when he speakes his tongue sounds like a trumpet all his lyneaments are as a man would wish em strong and cleane he weares a well steeld axe the staffe of gold his age some five and twenty
ther s another a little man but of a tough soule seeming as great as any fairer promises in such a body yet i never look d on
o he that s freckle fac d
the same my lord are they not sweet ones
in his hand he beares a charging staffe embost with silver
they are all the sonnes of honour
now as i have a soule i long to see em
lady you shall see men fight now
i wish it but not the cause my lord they would show bravely about the titles of two kingdomes tis pitty love should be so tyrannous o my soft harted sister what thinke you
weepe not till they weepe blood wench it must be
you have steel d em with your beautie —honord friend to you i give the feild pray order it fitting the persons that must use it
come ile goe visit em i cannot stay their fame has fir d me so till they appeare
poore wench goe weepe for whosoever wins looses a noble cosen for thy sins
her distraction is more at some time of the moone then at other some is it not
she is continually in a harmelesse distemper sleepes little altogether without appetite save often drinking dreaming of another world and a better and what broken peece of matter so ere she s about the name palamon lardes it that she farces ev ry busines withall fyts it to every question — enter daughter
looke where shee comes you shall perceive her behaviour
i have forgot it quite the burden on t was downe a downe a and pend by no worse man then giraldo emilias schoolemaster he s as fantasticall too as ever he may goe upon s legs —for in the next world will dido see palamon and then will she be out of love with eneas
ev n thus all day long
now for this charme that i told you of you must bring a peece of silver on the tip of your tongue or no ferry then if it be your chance to come where the blessed spirits as ther s a sight now—we maids that have our lyvers perish d crakt to peeces with love we shall come there and doe nothing all day long but picke flowers with proserpine then will i make palamon a nosegay then let him marke me —then— doctor
faith ile tell you sometime we goe to barly breake we of the blessed alas tis a sore life they have i th other place such burning frying boyling hissing howling chattring cursing oh they have shrowd measure
take heede if one be mad or hang or drowne themselves thither they goe iupiter blesse vs and there shall we be put in a caldron of lead and vsurers grease amongst a whole million of cutpurses and there boyle like a gamon of bacon that will never be enough
lords and courtiers that have got maids with child they are in this place they shall stand in fire up to the nav le and in yce up to th hart and there th offending part burnes and the deceaving part freezes in troth a very greevous punishment as one would thinke for such a trifle beleve me one would marry a leaprous witch to be rid on t ile assure you
tis not an engraffed madnesse but a most thicke and profound mellencholly
to heare there a proud lady and a proud citty wiffe howle together
i were a beast and il d call it good sport one cries o this smoake
one cries o that ever i did it behind the arras
and then howles th other curses a suing fellow and her garden house
sings i will be true my stars my fate c exit daugh
what thinke you of her sir
i thinke she has a perturbed minde which i cannot minister to
vnderstand you she ever affected any man ere she beheld palamon
i was once sir in great hope she had fixd her liking on this gentleman my friend
i did thinke so too and would account i had a great pen worth on t to give halfe my state that both she and i at this present stood unfainedly on the same tearmes
that intemprat surfeit of her eye hath distemperd the other sences they may returne and settle againe to execute their preordaind faculties but they are now in a most extravagant vagary
it is a falsehood she is in which is with falsehood to be combated
this may bring her to eate to sleepe and reduce what s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment i have seene it approved how many times i know not but to make the number more i have great hope in this
i will betweene the passages of this project come in with my applyance let us put it in execution and hasten the successe which doubt not will bring forth comfort
before the temples of mars venus and diana
now let em enter and before the gods tender their holy prayers let the temples burne bright with sacred fires and the altars in hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense to those above us let no due be wanting florish of cornets

the glasse is running now that cannot finish till one of us expire thinke you but thus that were there ought in me which strove to show mine enemy in this businesse wer t one eye against another arme opprest by arme i would destroy th offender coz i would though parcell of my selfe then from this gather how i should tender you
i am in labour to push your name your auncient love our kindred out of my memory and i th selfe same place to seate something i would confound so hoyst we the sayles that must these vessells port even where the heavenly lymiter pleases
you speake well before i turne let me embrace thee cosen this i shall never doe agen
why let it be so farewell coz

exeunt theseus hipolita perithous c emilia
arcite is gently visagd yet his eye is like an engyn bent or a sharpe weapon in a soft sheath mercy and manly courage are bedfellowes in his visage
palamon has a most menacing aspect his brow is grav d and seemes to bury what it frownes on yet sometime tis not so but alters to the quallity of his thoughts long time his eye will dwell upon his object
mellencholly becomes him nobly so do s arcites mirth but palamons sadnes is a kinde of mirth so mingled as if mirth did make him sad and sadnes merry those darker humours that sticke misbecomingly on others on them live in faire dwelling
trompets sound as to a charge
harke how yon spurs to spirit doe incite the princes to their proofe
arcite may win me and yet may palamon wound arcite to the spoyling of his figure
o what pitty enough for such a chance if i were by i might doe hurt for they would glance their eies toward my seat and in that motion might omit a ward or forfeit an offence which crav d that very time it is much better i am not there oh better never borne then minister to such harme
a great cry and noice within crying a palamon
twas ever likely he lookd all grace and successe and he is doubtlesse the prim st of men i pre thee run and tell me how it goes
showt and cornets crying a palamon
poore servant thou hast lost vpon my right side still i wore thy picture palamons on the left why so i know not i had no end in t else chance would have it so
on the sinister side the heart lyes palamon had the best boding chance
another cry and showt within and cornets
this burst of clamour is sure th end o th combat
they saide that palamon had arcites body within an inch o th pyramid that the cry was generall a palamon but anon th assistants made a brave redemption and the two bold tytlers at this instant are hand to hand at it
were they metamorphisd both into one
there were no woman worth so composd a man their single share their noblenes peculier to them gives the prejudice of disparity values shortnes cornets
nay now the sound is arcite
i pre thee lay attention to the cry cornets
a great showt and cry arcite victory
set both thine eares to th busines
the cry is arcite and victory harke arcite victory
the combats consummation is proclaim d by the wind instruments
halfe sights saw that arcite was no babe god s lyd his richnes and costlines of spirit look t through him it could no more be hid in him then fire in flax then humble banckes can goe to law with waters that drift windes force to raging i did thinke good palamon would miscarry yet i knew not why i did thinke so our reasons are not prophets when oft our fancies are
they are comming off alas poore palamon

o loved sister he speakes now of as brave a knight as ere did spur a noble steed surely the gods would have him die a batchelour least his race should shew i th world too godlike his behaviour so charmed me that me thought alcides was to him a sow of lead if i could praise each part of him to th all i have spoke your arcite did not loose by t for he that was thus good encountred yet his better

oh all you heavenly powers where is your mercy
but that your wils have saide it must be so and charge me live to comfort this unfriended this miserable prince that cuts away a life more worthy from him then all women i should and would die too

to live still have their good wishes we prevent the loathsome misery of age beguile the gowt and rheume that in lag howres attend for grey approachers we come towards the gods yong and unwapper d not halting under crymes many and stale that sure shall please the gods sooner than such to give us nectar with em for we are more cleare spirits
my deare kinesmen whose lives for this poore comfort are laid downe you have sould em too too cheape

by my short life i am most glad on t tis the latest thing i shall be glad of pre thee tell her so commend me to her and to peece her portion tender her this
verily i thinke so a right good creature more to me deserving then i can quight or speake of
the gods requight you all and make her thankefull
adiew and let my life be now as short as my leave taking
a great noise within crying run save hold
it is a cursed hast you made if you have done so quickly
noble palamon the gods will shew their glory in a life that thou art yet to leade
can that be when venus i have said is false
arise great sir and give the tydings eare that are most dearly sweet and bitter
what hath wakt us from our dreame

the gods are mightie arcite if thy heart thy worthie manly heart be yet unbroken give me thy last words i am palamon one that yet loves thee dying
take emilia and with her all the worlds joy reach thy hand farewell i have told my last houre
i was false yet never treacherous forgive me cosen — one kisse from faire emilia tis done take her i die
ile close thine eyes prince blessed soules be with thee
thou art a right good man and while i live this day i give to teares
in this place first you fought ev n very here i sundred you acknowledge to the gods our thankes that you are living
his part is playd and though it were too short he did it well your day is lengthned and the blissefull dew of heaven do s arowze you
the powerfull venus well hath grac d her altar and given you your love our master mars hath vouch d his oracle and to arcite gave the grace of the contention so the deities have shewd due justice beare this hence
o cosen that we should things desire which doe cost us the losse of our desire
that nought could buy deare love but losse of deare love
never fortune did play a subtler game the conquerd triumphes the victor has the losse yet in the passage the gods have beene most equall palamon your kinseman hath confest the right o th lady did lye in you for you first saw her and even then proclaimd your fancie he restord her as your stolne iewell and desir d your spirit to send him hence forgiven the gods my justice take from my hand and they themselves become the executioners leade your lady off and call your lovers from the stage of death whom i adopt my frinds
a day or two let us looke sadly and give grace unto the funerall of arcite in whose end the visages of bridegroomes weele put on and smile with palamon for whom an houre but one houre since i was as dearely sorry as glad of arcite and am now as glad as for him sorry
o you heavenly charmers what things you make of us
for what we lacke we laugh for what we have are sorry still are children in some kind
let us be thankefull for that which is and with you leave dispute that are above our question
let s goe off and beare us like the time
epilogue i would now aske ye how ye like the play but as it is with schoole boyes cannot say i am cruell fearefull pray yet stay a while and let me looke upon ye no man smile
then it goes hard i see he that has lov d a yong hansome wench then show his face— tis strange if none be heere—and if he will against his conscience let him hisse and kill our market tis in vaine i see to stay yee have at the worst can come then
and yet mistake me not i am not bold we have no such cause
if the tale we have told for tis no other any way content ye for to that honest purpose it was ment ye we have our end and ye shall have ere long i dare say many a better to prolong your old loves to us we and all our might rest at your service

if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia
i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves
verily i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge
we cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—i know not what to say
we will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot praise us as little accuse us
you pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely
believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
sicilia cannot show himself over kind to bohemia
they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now
since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds
i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it
you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius
it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note
i very well agree with you in the hopes of him
it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh
they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man
would they else be content to die
yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live
if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one
a room of state in the palace
enter leontes polixenes hermione mamillius camillo and attendants
nine changes of the watery star hath been the shepherd’s note since we have left our throne without a burden
time as long again would be fill’d up my brother with our thanks and yet we should for perpetuity go hence in debt and therefore like a cipher yet standing in rich place i multiply with one “we thank you” many thousands more that go before it
stay your thanks a while and pay them when you part
i am question’d by my fears of what may chance or breed upon our absence that may blow no sneaping winds at home to make us say “this is put forth too truly ” besides i have stay’d to tire your royalty
we are tougher brother than you can put us to ’t
we’ll part the time between ’s then and in that i’ll no gainsaying
press me not beseech you so there is no tongue that moves none none i’ th’ world so soon as yours could win me so it should now were there necessity in your request although ’twere needful i denied it
my affairs do even drag me homeward which to hinder were in your love a whip to me my stay to you a charge and trouble to save both farewell our brother
i had thought sir to have held my peace until you had drawn oaths from him not to stay
you sir charge him too coldly
tell him you are sure all in bohemia’s well this satisfaction the by gone day proclaimed
say this to him he’s beat from his best ward
to tell he longs to see his son were strong
but let him say so then and let him go but let him swear so and he shall not stay we’ll thwack him hence with distaffs
to polixenes yet of your royal presence i’ll adventure the borrow of a week
when at bohemia you take my lord i’ll give him my commission to let him there a month behind the gest prefix’d for’s parting —yet good deed leontes i love thee not a jar of th’ clock behind what lady she her lord
you put me off with limber vows but i though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths should yet say “sir no going ” verily you shall not go
a lady’s verily is as potent as a lord’s
force me to keep you as a prisoner not like a guest so you shall pay your fees when you depart and save your thanks
by your dread “verily ” one of them you shall be
to be your prisoner should import offending which is for me less easy to commit than you to punish
not your gaoler then but your kind hostess
come i’ll question you of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys
we were fair queen two lads that thought there was no more behind but such a day tomorrow as today and to be boy eternal
was not my lord the verier wag o’ th’ two
we were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun and bleat the one at th’ other
what we chang’d was innocence for innocence we knew not the doctrine of ill doing nor dream’d that any did
had we pursu’d that life and our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d with stronger blood we should have answer’d heaven boldly “not guilty ” the imposition clear’d hereditary ours
by this we gather you have tripp’d since
o my most sacred lady temptations have since then been born to ’s
for in those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes of my young play fellow
of this make no conclusion lest you say your queen and i are devils
yet go on th’ offences we have made you do we’ll answer if you first sinn’d with us and that with us you did continue fault and that you slipp’d not with any but with us
at my request he would not
hermione my dearest thou never spok’st to better purpose
cram ’s with praise and make ’s as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
you may ride ’s with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere with spur we heat an acre
but to th’ goal my last good deed was to entreat his stay
it has an elder sister or i mistake you o would her name were grace
but once before i spoke to the purpose—when
nay let me have’t i long
why that was when three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death ere i could make thee open thy white hand and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter “i am yours for ever ” hermione
why lo you now i have spoke to th’ purpose twice
the one for ever earn’d a royal husband th’ other for some while a friend
giving her hand to polixenes leontes
to mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
i have tremor cordis on me
my heart dances but not for joy —not joy
this entertainment may a free face put on derive a liberty from heartiness from bounty fertile bosom and well become the agent ’t may i grant but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers as now they are and making practis’d smiles as in a looking glass and then to sigh as ’twere the mort o’ th’ deer
o that is entertainment my bosom likes not nor my brows
they say it is a copy out of mine
come captain we must be neat not neat but cleanly captain and yet the steer the heifer and the calf are all call’d neat —still virginalling upon his palm —how now you wanton calf
yes if you will my lord
thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that i have to be full like me —yet they say we are almost as like as eggs women say so that will say anything
but were they false as o’er dy’d blacks as wind as waters false as dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes no bourn ’twixt his and mine yet were it true to say this boy were like me
come sir page look on me with your welkin eye sweet villain
thy intention stabs the centre thou dost make possible things not so held communicat’st with dreams —how can this be — with what’s unreal thou coactive art and fellow’st nothing then ’tis very credent thou may’st co join with something and thou dost and that beyond commission and i find it and that to the infection of my brains and hardening of my brows
how is’t with you best brother
you look as if you held a brow of much distraction are you mov’d my lord
how sometimes nature will betray its folly its tenderness and make itself a pastime to harder bosoms
looking on the lines of my boy’s face methoughts i did recoil twenty three years and saw myself unbreech’d in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled lest it should bite its master and so prove as ornaments oft do too dangerous
how like methought i then was to this kernel this squash this gentleman
mine honest friend will you take eggs for money
why happy man be ’s dole
my brother are you so fond of your young prince as we do seem to be of ours
if at home sir he’s all my exercise my mirth my matter now my sworn friend and then mine enemy my parasite my soldier statesman all
he makes a july’s day short as december and with his varying childness cures in me thoughts that would thick my blood
so stands this squire offic’d with me
we two will walk my lord and leave you to your graver steps
hermione how thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome let what is dear in sicily be cheap next to thyself and my young rover he’s apparent to my heart
if you would seek us we are yours i’ the garden
to your own bents dispose you you’ll be found be you beneath the sky
aside i am angling now though you perceive me not how i give line
how she holds up the neb the bill to him
and arms her with the boldness of a wife to her allowing husband
exeunt polixenes hermione and attendants gone already
inch thick knee deep o’er head and ears a fork’d one — go play boy play
thy mother plays and i play too but so disgrac’d a part whose issue will hiss me to my grave contempt and clamour will be my knell
there have been or i am much deceiv’d cuckolds ere now and many a man there is even at this present now while i speak this holds his wife by th’ arm that little thinks she has been sluic’d in ’s absence and his pond fish’d by his next neighbour by sir smile his neighbour
nay there’s comfort in ’t whiles other men have gates and those gates open’d as mine against their will
should all despair that hath revolted wives the tenth of mankind would hang themselves
physic for’t there’s none it is a bawdy planet that will strike where ’tis predominant and ’tis powerful think it from east west north and south
be it concluded no barricado for a belly
know’t it will let in and out the enemy with bag and baggage
many thousand of us have the disease and feel’t not —how now boy
i am like you they say
go play mamillius thou’rt an honest man
exit mamillius camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
you had much ado to make his anchor hold when you cast out it still came home
he would not stay at your petitions made his business more material
aside they’re here with me already whisp’ring rounding “sicilia is a so forth ” ’tis far gone when i shall gust it last —how came’t camillo that he did stay
at the queen’s be’t “good” should be pertinent but so it is it is not
was this taken by any understanding pate but thine
for thy conceit is soaking will draw in more than the common blocks
not noted is’t but of the finer natures
by some severals of head piece extraordinary
lower messes perchance are to this business purblind
i think most understand bohemia stays here longer
to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress
i have trusted thee camillo with all the nearest things to my heart as well my chamber counsels wherein priest like thou hast cleans’d my bosom i from thee departed thy penitent reform’d
but we have been deceiv’d in thy integrity deceiv’d in that which seems so
to bide upon’t thou art not honest or if thou inclin’st that way thou art a coward which hoxes honesty behind restraining from course requir’d or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent or else a fool that seest a game play’d home the rich stake drawn and tak’st it all for jest
my gracious lord i may be negligent foolish and fearful in every one of these no man is free but that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth
in your affairs my lord if ever i were wilful negligent it was my folly if industriously i play’d the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted whereof the execution did cry out against the non performance ’twas a fear which oft affects the wisest these my lord are such allow’d infirmities that honesty is never free of
but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it ’tis none of mine
but that’s past doubt you have or your eye glass is thicker than a cuckold’s horn or heard
for to a vision so apparent rumour cannot be mute or thought
for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think my wife is slippery
if thou wilt confess or else be impudently negative to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say my wife’s a hobby horse deserves a name as rank as any flax wench that puts to before her troth plight say’t and justify’t
i would not be a stander by to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so without my present vengeance taken ’shrew my heart you never spoke what did become you less than this which to reiterate were sin as deep as that though true
stopping the career of laughter with a sigh —a note infallible of breaking honesty —horsing foot on foot
and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only that would unseen be wicked
why then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing
good my lord be cur’d of this diseas’d opinion and betimes for ’tis most dangerous
it is you lie you lie i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave or else a hovering temporizer that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil inclining to them both
were my wife’s liver infected as her life she would not live the running of one glass
why he that wears her like her medal hanging about his neck bohemia who if i had servants true about me that bare eyes to see alike mine honour as their profits their own particular thrifts they would do that which should undo more doing ay and thou his cupbearer —whom i from meaner form have bench’d and rear’d to worship who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven how i am galled —mightst bespice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink which draught to me were cordial
sir my lord i could do this and that with no rash potion but with a ling’ring dram that should not work maliciously like poison
but i cannot believe this crack to be in my dread mistress so sovereignly being honourable
i have lov’d thee — leontes
make that thy question and go rot
dost think i am so muddy so unsettled to appoint myself in this vexation sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets which to preserve is sleep which being spotted is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps give scandal to the blood o’ th’ prince my son who i do think is mine and love as mine without ripe moving to’t
i must believe you sir i do and will fetch off bohemia for’t provided that when he’s remov’d your highness will take again your queen as yours at first even for your son’s sake and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours
thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down i’ll give no blemish to her honour none
my lord go then and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia and with your queen
if from me he have wholesome beverage account me not your servant
this is all do’t and thou hast the one half of my heart do’t not thou splitt’st thine own
i will seem friendly as thou hast advis’d me
but for me what case stand i in
i must be the poisoner of good polixenes and my ground to do’t is the obedience to a master one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too
to do this deed promotion follows
if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourish’d after i’d not do’t
but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villainy itself forswear’t
i must forsake the court to do’t or no is certain to me a break neck
methinks my favour here begins to warp
what is the news i’ th’ court
the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region lov’d as he loves himself
even now i met him with customary compliment when he wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling a lip of much contempt speeds from me and so leaves me to consider what is breeding that changes thus his manners
i dare not know my lord
do you know and dare not
’tis thereabouts for to yourself what you do know you must and cannot say you dare not
good camillo your chang’d complexions are to me a mirror which shows me mine chang’d too for i must be a party in this alteration finding myself thus alter’d with’t
there is a sickness which puts some of us in distemper but i cannot name the disease and it is caught of you that yet are well
make me not sighted like the basilisk
i have look’d on thousands who have sped the better by my regard but kill’d none so
camillo — as you are certainly a gentleman thereto clerk like experienc’d which no less adorns our gentry than our parents’ noble names in whose success we are gentle —i beseech you if you know aught which does behove my knowledge thereof to be inform’d imprison’t not in ignorant concealment
a sickness caught of me and yet i well
dost thou hear camillo i conjure thee by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge whereof the least is not this suit of mine that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward me how far off how near which way to be prevented if to be if not how best to bear it
sir i will tell you since i am charg’d in honour and by him that i think honourable
therefore mark my counsel which must be ev’n as swiftly follow’d as i mean to utter it or both yourself and me cry lost and so goodnight
i am appointed him to murder you
he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seen’t or been an instrument to vice you to’t that you have touch’d his queen forbiddenly
o then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yok’d with his that did betray the best
turn then my freshest reputation to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril where i arrive and my approach be shunn’d nay hated too worse than the great’st infection that e’er was heard or read
swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly whose foundation is pil’d upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body
i know not but i am sure ’tis safer to avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born
if therefore you dare trust my honesty that lies enclosed in this trunk which you shall bear along impawn’d away tonight
your followers i will whisper to the business and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o’ th’ city
for myself i’ll put my fortunes to your service which are here by this discovery lost
be not uncertain for by the honour of my parents i have utter’d truth which if you seek to prove i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer than one condemned by the king’s own mouth thereon his execution sworn
i saw his heart in ’s face
give me thy hand be pilot to me and thy places shall still neighbour mine
my ships are ready and my people did expect my hence departure two days ago
this jealousy is for a precious creature as she’s rare must it be great and as his person’s mighty must it be violent and as he does conceive he is dishonour’d by a man which ever profess’d to him why his revenges must in that be made more bitter
good expedition be my friend and comfort the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing of his ill ta’en suspicion
come camillo i will respect thee as a father if thou bear’st my life off hence
it is in mine authority to command the keys of all the posterns please your highness to take the urgent hour
exeunt act ii scene i sicilia
take the boy to you he so troubles me ’tis past enduring
come my gracious lord shall i be your playfellow
you’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if i were a baby still
not for because your brows are blacker yet black brows they say become some women best so that there be not too much hair there but in a semicircle or a half moon made with a pen
i learn’d it out of women’s faces
pray now what colour are your eyebrows
i have seen a lady’s nose that has been blue but not her eyebrows
hark ye the queen your mother rounds apace
we shall present our services to a fine new prince one of these days and then you’d wanton with us if we would have you
she is spread of late into a goodly bulk good time encounter her
come sir now i am for you again
pray you sit by us and tell ’s a tale
a sad tale’s best for winter
i have one of sprites and goblins
come on and do your best to fright me with your sprites you’re powerful at it
there was a man — hermione
nay come sit down then on
i will tell it softly yond crickets shall not hear it
come on then and give’t me in mine ear
enter leontes antigonus lords and guards
behind the tuft of pines i met them never saw i men scour so on their way i ey’d them even to their ships
how blest am i in my just censure in my true opinion
how accurs’d in being so blest
there may be in the cup a spider steep’d and one may drink depart and yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected but if one present th’ abhorr’d ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts
i have drunk and seen the spider
camillo was his help in this his pander
there is a plot against my life my crown all’s true that is mistrusted
that false villain whom i employ’d was pre employ’d by him
he has discover’d my design and i remain a pinch’d thing yea a very trick for them to play at will
how came the posterns so easily open
by his great authority which often hath no less prevail’d than so on your command
i am glad you did not nurse him
though he does bear some signs of me yet you have too much blood in him
bear the boy hence he shall not come about her away with him and let her sport herself with that she’s big with for ’tis polixenes has made thee swell thus
exit mamillius with some of the guards hermione
but i’d say he had not and i’ll be sworn you would believe my saying howe’er you learn th’ nayward
you my lords look on her mark her well
should a villain say so the most replenish’d villain in the world he were as much more villain you my lord do but mistake
you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which i’ll not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar
i have said she’s an adultress i have said with whom more she’s a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that she’s a bed swerver even as bad as those that vulgars give bold’st titles ay and privy to this their late escape
no by my life privy to none of this
how will this grieve you when you shall come to clearer knowledge that you thus have publish’d me
gentle my lord you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake
if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the centre is not big enough to bear a school boy’s top
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks
there’s some ill planet reigns i must be patient till the heavens look with an aspect more favourable
good my lords i am not prone to weeping as our sex commonly are the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities
but i have that honourable grief lodg’d here which burns worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords with thoughts so qualified as your charities shall best instruct you measure me and so the king’s will be perform’d
who is’t that goes with me
beseech your highness my women may be with me for you see my plight requires it
do not weep good fools there is no cause when you shall know your mistress has deserv’d prison then abound in tears as i come out this action i now go on is for my better grace
adieu my lord i never wish’d to see you sorry now i trust i shall
my women come you have leave
exeunt queen and ladies with guards first lord
beseech your highness call the queen again
be certain what you do sir lest your justice prove violence in the which three great ones suffer yourself your queen your son
for her my lord i dare my life lay down and will do’t sir please you to accept it that the queen is spotless i’ th’ eyes of heaven and to you—i mean in this which you accuse her
if it prove she’s otherwise i’ll keep my stables where i lodge my wife i’ll go in couples with her than when i feel and see her no further trust her
for every inch of woman in the world ay every dram of woman’s flesh is false if she be
it is for you we speak not for ourselves you are abus’d and by some putter on that will be damn’d for’t would i knew the villain i would land damn him
be she honour flaw’d i have three daughters the eldest is eleven the second and the third nine and some five if this prove true they’ll pay for’t
by mine honour i’ll geld ’em all fourteen they shall not see to bring false generations they are co heirs and i had rather glib myself than they should not produce fair issue
you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man’s nose but i do see’t and feel’t as you feel doing thus and see withal the instruments that feel
if it be so we need no grave to bury honesty
there’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten of the whole dungy earth
i had rather you did lack than i my lord upon this ground and more it would content me to have her honour true than your suspicion be blam’d for’t how you might
why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our forceful instigation
our prerogative calls not your counsels but our natural goodness imparts this which if you or stupified or seeming so in skill cannot or will not relish a truth like us inform yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter the loss the gain the ord’ring on’t is all properly ours
and i wish my liege you had only in your silent judgement tried it without more overture
either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool
camillo’s flight added to their familiarity which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture that lack’d sight only nought for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to th’ deed doth push on this proceeding
yet for a greater confirmation for in an act of this importance ’twere most piteous to be wild i have dispatch’d in post to sacred delphos to apollo’s temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuff’d sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me
though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to the minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to th’ truth
so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confin’d lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform
come follow us we are to speak in public for this business will raise us all
aside to laughter as i take it if the good truth were known

now good sir you know me do you not

pray you then conduct me to the queen
to the contrary i have express commandment
here’s ado to lock up honesty and honour from th’ access of gentle visitors
is’t lawful pray you to see her women
so please you madam to put apart these your attendants i shall bring emilia forth

exit gaoler here’s such ado to make no stain a stain as passes colouring
dear gentlewoman how fares our gracious lady
as well as one so great and so forlorn may hold together on her frights and griefs which never tender lady hath borne greater she is something before her time deliver’d
a daughter and a goodly babe lusty and like to live the queen receives much comfort in ’t says “my poor prisoner i am as innocent as you ” paulina
these dangerous unsafe lunes i’ th’ king beshrew them
he must be told on’t and he shall the office becomes a woman best
if i prove honey mouth’d let my tongue blister and never to my red look’d anger be the trumpet any more
pray you emilia commend my best obedience to the queen
if she dares trust me with her little babe i’ll show’t the king and undertake to be her advocate to th’ loud’st
we do not know how he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child the silence often of pure innocence persuades when speaking fails
most worthy madam your honour and your goodness is so evident that your free undertaking cannot miss a thriving issue there is no lady living so meet for this great errand
please your ladyship to visit the next room i’ll presently acquaint the queen of your most noble offer who but today hammer’d of this design but durst not tempt a minister of honour lest she should be denied
tell her emilia i’ll use that tongue i have if wit flow from ’t as boldness from my bosom let’t not be doubted i shall do good
now be you blest for it
i’ll to the queen please you come something nearer
madam if ’t please the queen to send the babe i know not what i shall incur to pass it having no warrant
you need not fear it sir this child was prisoner to the womb and is by law and process of great nature thence freed and enfranchis’d not a party to the anger of the king nor guilty of if any be the trespass of the queen
do not you fear upon mine honour i will stand betwixt you and danger

but she i can hook to me
say that she were gone given to the fire a moiety of my rest might come to me again
he took good rest tonight ’tis hop’d his sickness is discharg’d
to see his nobleness conceiving the dishonour of his mother
he straight declin’d droop’d took it deeply fasten’d and fix’d the shame on’t in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languish’d
leave me solely go see how he fares
the very thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me in himself too mighty and in his parties his alliance
let him be until a time may serve
for present vengeance take it on her

nay rather good my lords be second to me fear you his tyrannous passion more alas than the queen’s life
a gracious innocent soul more free than he is jealous
madam he hath not slept tonight commanded none should come at him
not so hot good sir i come to bring him sleep
’tis such as you that creep like shadows by him and do sigh at each his needless heavings —such as you nourish the cause of his awaking
i do come with words as med’cinal as true honest as either to purge him of that humour that presses him from sleep
no noise my lord but needful conference about some gossips for your highness
antigonus i charg’d thee that she should not come about me
i told her so my lord on your displeasure’s peril and on mine she should not visit you
in this unless he take the course that you have done commit me for committing honour—trust it he shall not rule me
when she will take the rein i let her run but she’ll not stumble
good my liege i come — and i beseech you hear me who professes myself your loyal servant your physician your most obedient counsellor yet that dares less appear so in comforting your evils than such as most seem yours—i say i come from your good queen
good queen my lord good queen i say good queen and would by combat make her good so were i a man the worst about you
let him that makes but trifles of his eyes first hand me on mine own accord i’ll off but first i’ll do my errand
the good queen for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter here ’tis commends it to your blessing
hence with her out o’ door a most intelligencing bawd
i am as ignorant in that as you in so entitling me and no less honest than you are mad which is enough i’ll warrant as this world goes to pass for honest
will you not push her out

so i would you did then ’twere past all doubt you’d call your children yours

this brat is none of mine it is the issue of polixenes
hence with it and together with the dam commit them to the fire
it is yours and might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge so like you ’tis the worse
behold my lords although the print be little the whole matter and copy of the father eye nose lip the trick of ’s frown his forehead nay the valley the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles the very mould and frame of hand nail finger and thou good goddess nature which hast made it so like to him that got it if thou hast the ordering of the mind too ’mongst all colours no yellow in ’t lest she suspect as he does her children not her husband’s
and losel thou art worthy to be hang’d that wilt not stay her tongue
hang all the husbands that cannot do that feat you’ll leave yourself hardly one subject
a most unworthy and unnatural lord can do no more
it is an heretic that makes the fire not she which burns in ’t
i’ll not call you tyrant but this most cruel usage of your queen not able to produce more accusation than your own weak hing’d fancy something savours of tyranny and will ignoble make you yea scandalous to the world
on your allegiance out of the chamber with her
were i a tyrant where were her life
she durst not call me so if she did know me one
i pray you do not push me i’ll be gone
look to your babe my lord ’tis yours jove send her a better guiding spirit
you that are thus so tender o’er his follies will never do him good not one of you
thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
even thou that hast a heart so tender o’er it take it hence and see it instantly consum’d with fire even thou and none but thou
take it up straight within this hour bring me word ’tis done and by good testimony or i’ll seize thy life with that thou else call’st thine
if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath say so the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out
go take it to the fire for thou set’st on thy wife
i did not sir these lords my noble fellows if they please can clear me in ’t
lords we can my royal liege he is not guilty of her coming hither
beseech your highness give us better credit we have always truly serv’d you and beseech so to esteem of us
and on our knees we beg as recompense of our dear services past and to come that you do change this purpose which being so horrible so bloody must lead on to some foul issue
i am a feather for each wind that blows
shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father
better burn it now than curse it then
but be it let it live
to antigonus you sir come you hither you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery your midwife there to save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard so sure as this beard’s grey
what will you adventure to save this brat’s life
anything my lord that my ability may undergo and nobleness impose at least thus much i’ll pawn the little blood which i have left to save the innocent
swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding
mark and perform it seest thou
for the fail of any point in’t shall not only be death to thyself but to thy lewd tongu’d wife whom for this time we pardon
we enjoin thee as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions and that there thou leave it without more mercy to it own protection and favour of the climate
as by strange fortune it came to us i do in justice charge thee on thy soul’s peril and thy body’s torture that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it
i swear to do this though a present death had been more merciful
come on poor babe some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens to be thy nurses
wolves and bears they say casting their savageness aside have done like offices of pity
sir be prosperous in more than this deed does require
and blessing against this cruelty fight on thy side poor thing condemn’d to loss
no i’ll not rear another’s issue
please your highness posts from those you sent to th’ oracle are come an hour since cleomenes and dion being well arriv’d from delphos are both landed hasting to th’ court
so please you sir their speed hath been beyond account
twenty three days they have been absent ’tis good speed foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear
prepare you lords summon a session that we may arraign our most disloyal lady for as she hath been publicly accus’d so shall she have a just and open trial
while she lives my heart will be a burden to me
leave me and think upon my bidding
exeunt act iii scene i sicilia
cleomenes the climate’s delicate the air most sweet fertile the isle the temple much surpassing the common praise it bears
i shall report for most it caught me the celestial habits methinks i so should term them and the reverence of the grave wearers
how ceremonious solemn and unearthly it was i’ th’ offering
cleomenes but of all the burst and the ear deaf’ning voice o’ th’ oracle kin to jove’s thunder so surprised my sense that i was nothing
if the event o’ th’ journey prove as successful to the queen —o be’t so — as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy the time is worth the use on’t
cleomenes great apollo turn all to th’ best
these proclamations so forcing faults upon hermione i little like
the violent carriage of it will clear or end the business when the oracle thus by apollo’s great divine seal’d up shall the contents discover something rare even then will rush to knowledge
enter leontes lords and officers appear properly seated
this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes ’gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much belov’d
let us be clear’d of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation
it is his highness’ pleasure that the queen appear in person here in court
hermione is brought in guarded paulina and ladies attending
reads “hermione queen to the worthy leontes king of sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with polixenes king of bohemia and conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open thou hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by night ” hermione
since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say “not guilty”
mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so receiv’d
but thus if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience
you my lord best know who least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devis’d and play’d to take spectators
for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great king’s daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honour ’fore who please to come and hear
for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare
for honour ’tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for
i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have strain’d t’ appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honour or in act or will that way inclining harden’d be the hearts of all that hear me and my near’st of kin cry fie upon my grave
i ne’er heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first
that’s true enough though ’tis a saying sir not due to me
more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge
for polixenes with whom i am accus’d i do confess i lov’d him as in honour he requir’d with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke ever since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours
now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dish’d for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant
you knew of his departure as you know what you have underta’en to do in ’s absence
sir you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams which i’ll lay down
you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dream’d it
as you were past all shame those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning it which is indeed more criminal in thee than it so thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death
sir spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek
to me can life be no commodity
the crown and comfort of my life your favour i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went
my second joy and first fruits of my body from his presence i am barr’d like one infectious
my third comfort starr’d most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth hal’d out to murder myself on every post proclaim’d a strumpet with immodest hatred the child bed privilege denied which ’longs to women of all fashion lastly hurried here to this place i’ th’ open air before i have got strength of limit
now my liege tell me what blessings i have here alive that i should fear to die
but yet hear this mistake me not no life i prize it not a straw but for mine honour which i would free if i shall be condemn’d upon surmises all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake i tell you ’tis rigour and not law
your honours all i do refer me to the oracle apollo be my judge
this your request is altogether just therefore bring forth and in apollo’s name his oracle exeunt certain officers hermione
the emperor of russia was my father
o that he were alive and here beholding his daughter’s trial
that he did but see the flatness of my misery yet with eyes of pity not revenge
enter officers with cleomenes and dion
you here shall swear upon this sword of justice that you cleomenes and dion have been both at delphos and from thence have brought this seal’d up oracle by the hand deliver’d of great apollo’s priest and that since then you have not dared to break the holy seal nor read the secrets in’t
break up the seals and read
reads “hermione is chaste polixenes blameless camillo a true subject leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the king shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found ” lords now blessed be the great apollo
ay my lord even so as it is here set down
there is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood
my lord the king the king
o sir i shall be hated to report it
the prince your son with mere conceit and fear of the queen’s speed is gone
apollo’s angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice
this news is mortal to the queen
look down and see what death is doing
take her hence her heart is but o’ercharg’d she will recover
i have too much believ’d mine own suspicion
beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life
exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione apollo pardon my great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle
i’ll reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done
he most humane and fill’d with honour to my kingly guest unclasp’d my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the certain hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honour
how he glisters thorough my rust
and how his piety does my deeds make the blacker
o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it break too
what fit is this good lady
what studied torments tyrant hast for me
what old or newer torture must i receive whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst
thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies fancies too weak for boys too green and idle for girls of nine
o think what they have done and then run mad indeed stark mad
for all thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it
i say she’s dead i’ll swear’t
if word nor oath prevail not go and see if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip her eye heat outwardly or breath within i’ll serve you as i would do the gods
do not repent these things for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir
therefore betake thee to nothing but despair
a thousand knees ten thousand years together naked fasting upon a barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual could not move the gods to look that way thou wert
go on go on thou canst not speak too much i have deserv’d all tongues to talk their bitterest
say no more howe’er the business goes you have made fault i’ th’ boldness of your speech
i am sorry for ’t all faults i make when i shall come to know them i do repent
alas i have show’d too much the rashness of a woman he is touch’d to th’ noble heart
what’s gone and what’s past help should be past grief
do not receive affliction at my petition i beseech you rather let me be punish’d that have minded you of what you should forget
now good my liege sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman the love i bore your queen—lo fool again
i’ll speak of her no more nor of your children
i’ll not remember you of my own lord who is lost too
take your patience to you and i’ll say nothing
thou didst speak but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee
prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both
upon them shall the causes of their death appear unto our shame perpetual
once a day i’ll visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation
so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it
come and lead me to these sorrows
a desert country near the sea
enter antigonus with the child and a mariner
thou art perfect then our ship hath touch’d upon the deserts of bohemia
ay my lord and fear we have landed in ill time the skies look grimly and threaten present blusters
in my conscience the heavens with that we have in hand are angry and frown upon ’s
go get aboard look to thy bark i’ll not be long before i call upon thee
make your best haste and go not too far i’ th’ land ’tis like to be loud weather besides this place is famous for the creatures of prey that keep upon ’t
go thou away i’ll follow instantly
i am glad at heart to be so rid o’ th’ business
i have heard but not believ’d the spirits of the dead may walk again if such thing be thy mother appear’d to me last night for ne’er was dream so like a waking
to me comes a creature sometimes her head on one side some another
i never saw a vessel of like sorrow so fill’d and so becoming in pure white robes like very sanctity she did approach my cabin where i lay thrice bow’d before me and gasping to begin some speech her eyes became two spouts
the fury spent anon did this break from her “good antigonus since fate against thy better disposition hath made thy person for the thrower out of my poor babe according to thine oath places remote enough are in bohemia there weep and leave it crying
and for the babe is counted lost for ever perdita i prithee call’t
for this ungentle business put on thee by my lord thou ne’er shalt see thy wife paulina more ” and so with shrieks she melted into air
affrighted much i did in time collect myself and thought this was so and no slumber
dreams are toys yet for this once yea superstitiously i will be squar’d by this
i do believe hermione hath suffer’d death and that apollo would this being indeed the issue of king polixenes it should here be laid either for life or death upon the earth of its right father
there lie and there thy character there these laying down the child and a bundle which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty and still rest thine
the storm begins poor wretch that for thy mother’s fault art thus expos’d to loss and what may follow
weep i cannot but my heart bleeds and most accurs’d am i to be by oath enjoin’d to this
the day frowns more and more
thou’rt like to have a lullaby too rough
i never saw the heavens so dim by day
this is the chase i am gone for ever
exit pursued by a bear enter an old shepherd
i would there were no age between ten and three and twenty or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting—hark you now
would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt this weather
they have scared away two of my best sheep which i fear the wolf will sooner find than the master if anywhere i have them ’tis by the sea side browsing of ivy
good luck an ’t be thy will what have we here
taking up the child mercy on ’s a bairn
a boy or a child i wonder
a pretty one a very pretty one
though i am not bookish yet i can read waiting gentlewoman in the scape
this has been some stair work some trunk work some behind door work
they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here
i’ll take it up for pity yet i’ll tarry till my son come he halloed but even now
if thou’lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten come hither
i have seen two such sights by sea and by land
but i am not to say it is a sea for it is now the sky betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin’s point
i would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it takes up the shore
but that’s not to the point
o the most piteous cry of the poor souls
sometimes to see ’em and not to see ’em
now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon swallowed with yest and froth as you’d thrust a cork into a hogshead
and then for the land service to see how the bear tore out his shoulder bone how he cried to me for help and said his name was antigonus a nobleman
but to make an end of the ship to see how the sea flap dragon’d it but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than the sea or weather
name of mercy when was this boy
i have not winked since i saw these sights the men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half dined on the gentleman
would i had been by to have helped the old man
i would you had been by the ship side to have helped her there your charity would have lacked footing
now bless thyself thou met’st with things dying i with things new born
look thee a bearing cloth for a squire’s child
look thee here take up take up boy open’t
it was told me i should be rich by the fairies
if the sins of your youth are forgiven you you’re well to live
this is fairy gold boy and ’twill prove so
up with it keep it close home home the next way
we are lucky boy and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy
let my sheep go come good boy the next way home
go you the next way with your findings
i’ll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten
they are never curst but when they are hungry if there be any of him left i’ll bury it
if thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is fetch me to th’ sight of him
marry will i and you shall help to put him i’ th’ ground
’tis a lucky day boy and we’ll do good deeds on ’t
i that please some try all both joy and terror of good and bad that makes and unfolds error now take upon me in the name of time to use my wings
impute it not a crime to me or my swift passage that i slide o’er sixteen years and leave the growth untried of that wide gap since it is in my power to o’erthrow law and in one self born hour to plant and o’erwhelm custom
let me pass the same i am ere ancient’st order was or what is now received
i witness to the times that brought them in so shall i do to th’ freshest things now reigning and make stale the glistering of this present as my tale now seems to it
your patience this allowing i turn my glass and give my scene such growing as you had slept between
leontes leaving th’ effects of his fond jealousies so grieving that he shuts up himself imagine me gentle spectators that i now may be in fair bohemia and remember well i mentioned a son o’ th’ king’s which florizel i now name to you and with speed so pace to speak of perdita now grown in grace equal with wondering
what of her ensues i list not prophesy but let time’s news be known when ’tis brought forth
a shepherd’s daughter and what to her adheres which follows after is th’ argument of time
of this allow if ever you have spent time worse ere now if never yet that time himself doth say he wishes earnestly you never may
a room in the palace of polixenes
i pray thee good camillo be no more importunate ’tis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this
it is fifteen years since i saw my country
though i have for the most part been aired abroad i desire to lay my bones there
besides the penitent king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay or i o’erween to think so —which is another spur to my departure
as thou lov’st me camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need i have of thee thine own goodness hath made better not to have had thee than thus to want thee
thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if i have not enough considered as too much i cannot to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships
of that fatal country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou call’st him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented
say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my son
kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues
sir it is three days since i saw the prince
what his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but i have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared
i have considered so much camillo and with some care so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom i have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
i have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage
that’s likewise part of my intelligence but i fear the angle that plucks our son thither
thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither
prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia
a road near the shepherd’s cottage
when daffodils begin to peer with hey
the doxy over the dale why then comes in the sweet o’ the year for the red blood reigns in the winter’s pale the white sheet bleaching on the hedge with hey
the sweet birds o how they sing
doth set my pugging tooth on edge for a quart of ale is a dish for a king the lark that tirra lirra chants with hey
the thrush and the jay are summer songs for me and my aunts while we lie tumbling in the hay i have served prince florizel and in my time wore three pile but now i am out of service
but shall i go mourn for that my dear
the pale moon shines by night and when i wander here and there i then do most go right if tinkers may have leave to live and bear the sow skin budget then my account i well may give and in the stocks avouch it my traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen
my father named me autolycus who being i as am littered under mercury was likewise a snapper up of unconsidered trifles
with die and drab i purchased this caparison and my revenue is the silly cheat
gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway
beating and hanging are terrors to me
for the life to come i sleep out the thought of it
let me see every ’leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn what comes the wool to
aside if the springe hold the cock’s mine
let me see what am i to buy for our sheep shearing feast
“three pound of sugar five pound of currants rice”—what will this sister of mine do with rice
but my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it on
she hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the shearers three man song men all and very good ones but they are most of them means and basses but one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to hornpipes
i must have saffron to colour the warden pies “mace dates” none that’s out of my note “nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger” but that i may beg “four pound of prunes and as many of raisins o’ th’ sun ” autolycus
grovelling on the ground o that ever i was born
pluck but off these rags and then death death
thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off
o sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes i have received which are mighty ones and millions
a million of beating may come to a great matter
i am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel ta’en from me and these detestable things put upon me
what by a horseman or a footman
a footman sweet sir a footman
indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee if this be a horseman’s coat it hath seen very hot service
lend me thy hand i’ll help thee come lend me thy hand
o good sir softly good sir
i fear sir my shoulder blade is out
picks his pocket good sir softly
you ha’ done me a charitable office
i have a little money for thee
no good sweet sir no i beseech you sir i have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom i was going
i shall there have money or anything i want
offer me no money i pray you that kills my heart
what manner of fellow was he that robbed you
a fellow sir that i have known to go about with troll my dames
i knew him once a servant of the prince i cannot tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court
his vices you would say there’s no virtue whipped out of the court
they cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide
he hath been since an ape bearer then a process server a bailiff
then he compassed a motion of the prodigal son and married a tinker’s wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue
prig for my life prig he haunts wakes fairs and bear baitings
very true sir he sir he that’s the rogue that put me into this apparel
not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia
if you had but looked big and spit at him he’d have run
i must confess to you sir i am no fighter
i am false of heart that way and that he knew i warrant him
sweet sir much better than i was
i can stand and walk i will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman’s
shall i bring thee on the way
no good faced sir no sweet sir
i must go buy spices for our sheep shearing
exit clown your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice
i’ll be with you at your sheep shearing too
if i make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue
sings jog on jog on the footpath way and merrily hent the stile a a merry heart goes all the day your sad tires in a mile a exit scene iv
these your unusual weeds to each part of you do give a life no shepherdess but flora peering in april’s front
this your sheep shearing is as a meeting of the petty gods and you the queen on ’t
sir my gracious lord to chide at your extremes it not becomes me o pardon that i name them
your high self the gracious mark o’ th’ land you have obscur’d with a swain’s wearing and me poor lowly maid most goddess like prank’d up
but that our feasts in every mess have folly and the feeders digest it with a custom i should blush to see you so attir’d swoon i think to show myself a glass
i bless the time when my good falcon made her flight across thy father’s ground
to me the difference forges dread
your greatness hath not been us’d to fear
even now i tremble to think your father by some accident should pass this way as you did
how would he look to see his work so noble vilely bound up
or how should i in these my borrow’d flaunts behold the sternness of his presence
the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have taken the shapes of beasts upon them
jupiter became a bull and bellow’d the green neptune a ram and bleated and the fire rob’d god golden apollo a poor humble swain as i seem now
their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer nor in a way so chaste since my desires run not before mine honour nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith
o but sir your resolution cannot hold when ’tis oppos’d as it must be by the power of the king one of these two must be necessities which then will speak that you must change this purpose or i my life
thou dearest perdita with these forc’d thoughts i prithee darken not the mirth o’ th’ feast
or i’ll be thine my fair or not my father’s
for i cannot be mine own nor anything to any if i be not thine
to this i am most constant though destiny say no
strangle such thoughts as these with anything that you behold the while
your guests are coming lift up your countenance as it were the day of celebration of that nuptial which we two have sworn shall come
o lady fortune stand you auspicious
see your guests approach address yourself to entertain them sprightly and let’s be red with mirth
enter shepherd with polixenes and camillo disguised clown mopsa dorcas with others
when my old wife liv’d upon this day she was both pantler butler cook both dame and servant welcom’d all serv’d all would sing her song and dance her turn now here at upper end o’ th’ table now i’ th’ middle on his shoulder and his her face o’ fire with labour and the thing she took to quench it she would to each one sip
you are retired as if you were a feasted one and not the hostess of the meeting pray you bid these unknown friends to ’s welcome for it is a way to make us better friends more known
come quench your blushes and present yourself that which you are mistress o’ th’ feast
come on and bid us welcome to your sheep shearing as your good flock shall prosper
it is my father’s will i should take on me the hostess ship o’ the day
give me those flowers there dorcas
reverend sirs for you there’s rosemary and rue these keep seeming and savour all the winter long
grace and remembrance be to you both
shepherdess— a fair one are you—well you fit our ages with flowers of winter
sir the year growing ancient not yet on summer’s death nor on the birth of trembling winter the fairest flowers o’ th’ season are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors which some call nature’s bastards of that kind our rustic garden’s barren and i care not to get slips of them
wherefore gentle maiden do you neglect them
for i have heard it said there is an art which in their piedness shares with great creating nature
say there be yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean
so over that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature makes
you see sweet maid we marry a gentler scion to the wildest stock and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race
this is an art which does mend nature change it rather but the art itself is nature
then make your garden rich in gillyvors and do not call them bastards
i’ll not put the dibble in earth to set one slip of them no more than were i painted i would wish this youth should say ’twere well and only therefore desire to breed by me
here’s flowers for you hot lavender mints savory marjoram the marigold that goes to bed with th’ sun and with him rises weeping
these are flowers of middle summer and i think they are given to men of middle age
i should leave grazing were i of your flock and only live by gazing
you’d be so lean that blasts of january would blow you through and through
to florizel now my fair’st friend i would i had some flowers o’ th’ spring that might become your time of day and yours and yours that wear upon your virgin branches yet your maidenheads growing
o proserpina from the flowers now that frighted thou let’st fall from dis’s waggon
daffodils that come before the swallow dares and take the winds of march with beauty violets dim but sweeter than the lids of juno’s eyes or cytherea’s breath pale primroses that die unmarried ere they can behold bright phoebus in his strength a malady most incident to maids bold oxlips and the crown imperial lilies of all kinds the flower de luce being one
o these i lack to make you garlands of and my sweet friend to strew him o’er and o’er
no like a bank for love to lie and play on not like a corse or if not to be buried but quick and in mine arms
methinks i play as i have seen them do in whitsun pastorals
sure this robe of mine does change my disposition
what you do still betters what is done
when you speak sweet i’d have you do it ever
when you sing i’d have you buy and sell so so give alms pray so and for the ord’ring your affairs to sing them too
when you do dance i wish you a wave o’ th’ sea that you might ever do nothing but that move still still so and own no other function
each your doing so singular in each particular crowns what you are doing in the present deeds that all your acts are queens
o doricles your praises are too large
but that your youth and the true blood which peeps fairly through ’t do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd with wisdom i might fear my doricles you woo’d me the false way
i think you have as little skill to fear as i have purpose to put you to ’t
but come our dance i pray
so turtles pair that never mean to part
this is the prettiest low born lass that ever ran on the green sward
nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than herself too noble for this place
he tells her something that makes her blood look out
good sooth she is the queen of curds and cream
mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic to mend her kissing with
not a word a word we stand upon our manners
here a dance of shepherds and shepherdesses polixenes
pray good shepherd what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter
they call him doricles and boasts himself to have a worthy feeding
but i have it upon his own report and i believe it
he says he loves my daughter
i think so too for never gaz’d the moon upon the water as he’ll stand and read as ’twere my daughter’s eyes
and to be plain i think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best
so she does anything though i report it that should be silent
if young doricles do light upon her she shall bring him that which he not dreams of
o master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe no the bagpipe could not move you
he sings several tunes faster than you’ll tell money
he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s ears grew to his tunes
he could never come better he shall come in
i love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably
he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes
no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves
he has the prettiest love songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings “jump her and thump her” and where some stretch mouthed rascal would as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer “whoop do me no harm good man” puts him off slights him with “whoop do me no harm good man ” polixenes
believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow
he hath ribbons of all the colours i’ th’ rainbow points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can learnedly handle though they come to him by th’ gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns why he sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses you would think a smock were a she angel he so chants to the sleeve hand and the work about the square on ’t
prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in ’s tunes
you have of these pedlars that have more in them than you’d think sister
ay good brother or go about to think
lawn as white as driven snow cypress black as e’er was crow gloves as sweet as damask roses masks for faces and for noses bugle bracelet necklace amber perfume for a lady’s chamber golden quoifs and stomachers for my lads to give their dears pins and poking sticks of steel what maids lack from head to heel
come buy of me come come buy come buy buy lads or else your lasses cry
if i were not in love with mopsa thou shouldst take no money of me but being enthralled as i am it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves
i was promised them against the feast but they come not too late now
he hath promised you more than that or there be liars
he hath paid you all he promised you
maybe he has paid you more which will shame you to give him again
is there no manners left among maids
will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces
is there not milking time when you are going to bed or kiln hole to whistle of these secrets but you must be tittle tattling before all our guests
clamour your tongues and not a word more
come you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves
have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way and lost all my money
and indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary
i hope so sir for i have about me many parcels of charge
i love a ballad in print alife for then we are sure they are true
here’s one to a very doleful tune
how a usurer’s wife was brought to bed of twenty money bags at a burden and how she longed to eat adders’ heads and toads carbonadoed
very true and but a month old
bless me from marrying a usurer
here’s the midwife’s name to’t one mistress taleporter and five or six honest wives that were present
why should i carry lies abroad
come on lay it by and let’s first see more ballads
we’ll buy the other things anon
here’s another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on wednesday the fourscore of april forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids
it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her
the ballad is very pitiful and as true
is it true too think you
five justices’ hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold
this is a merry ballad but a very pretty one
why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “two maids wooing a man ” there’s scarce a maid westward but she sings it
’tis in request i can tell you
we can both sing it if thou’lt bear a part thou shalt hear ’tis in three parts
we had the tune on ’t a month ago
i can bear my part you must know ’tis my occupation have at it with you
get you hence for i must go where it fits not you to know dorcas
it becomes thy oath full well thou to me thy secrets tell dorcas
or thou goest to th’ grange or mill
if to either thou dost ill autolycus
thou hast sworn my love to be mopsa
thou hast sworn it more to me
we’ll have this song out anon by ourselves
my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk and we’ll not trouble them
come bring away thy pack after me
wenches i’ll buy for you both
pedlar let’s have the first choice
exit with dorcas and mopsa autolycus
aside and you shall pay well for ’em
will you buy any tape or lace for your cape my dainty duck my dear a
any silk any thread any toys for your head of the new’st and fin’st fin’st wear a
come to the pedlar money’s a meddler that doth utter all men’s ware a exit enter servant
master there is three carters three shepherds three neat herds three swine herds that have made themselves all men of hair
they call themselves saltiers and they have dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not in ’t but they themselves are o’ the mind if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling it will please plentifully
here has been too much homely foolery already
i know sir we weary you
you weary those that refresh us pray let’s see these four threes of herdsmen
one three of them by their own report sir hath danced before the king and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th’ square
leave your prating since these good men are pleased let them come in but quickly now
why they stay at door sir
exit enter twelve rustics habited like satyrs
o father you’ll know more of that hereafter
to camillo is it not too far gone
to florizel how now fair shepherd
your heart is full of something that does take your mind from feasting
sooth when i was young and handed love as you do i was wont to load my she with knacks i would have ransack’d the pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it to her acceptance
you have let him go and nothing marted with him
if your lass interpretation should abuse and call this your lack of love or bounty you were straited for a reply at least if you make a care of happy holding her
old sir i know she prizes not such trifles as these are the gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d up in my heart which i have given already but not deliver’d
o hear me breathe my life before this ancient sir who it should seem hath sometime lov’d
this hand as soft as dove’s down and as white as it or ethiopian’s tooth or the fann’d snow that’s bolted by th’ northern blasts twice o’er
how prettily the young swain seems to wash the hand was fair before
let me hear what you profess
do and be witness to ’t
and he and more than he and men the earth the heavens and all that were i crown’d the most imperial monarch thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge more than was ever man’s i would not prize them without her love for her employ them all commend them and condemn them to her service or to their own perdition
but my daughter say you the like to him
i cannot speak so well nothing so well no nor mean better by th’ pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out the purity of his
and friends unknown you shall bear witness to’t
i give my daughter to him and will make her portion equal his
o that must be i’ th’ virtue of your daughter one being dead i shall have more than you can dream of yet enough then for your wonder
but come on contract us ’fore these witnesses
come your hand and daughter yours
soft swain awhile beseech you have you a father
i have but what of him
methinks a father is at the nuptial of his son a guest that best becomes the table
pray you once more is not your father grown incapable of reasonable affairs
is he not stupid with age and alt’ring rheums
and again does nothing but what he did being childish
no good sir he has his health and ampler strength indeed than most have of his age
by my white beard you offer him if this be so a wrong something unfilial reason my son should choose himself a wife but as good reason the father all whose joy is nothing else but fair posterity should hold some counsel in such a business
i yield all this but for some other reasons my grave sir which ’tis not fit you know i not acquaint my father of this business
let him my son he shall not need to grieve at knowing of thy choice
discovering himself mark your divorce young sir whom son i dare not call thou art too base to be acknowledged thou a sceptre’s heir that thus affects a sheep hook
thou old traitor i am sorry that by hanging thee i can but shorten thy life one week
and thou fresh piece of excellent witchcraft whom of force must know the royal fool thou cop’st with — shepherd
i’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers and made more homely than thy state
for thee fond boy if i may ever know thou dost but sigh that thou no more shalt see this knack as never i mean thou shalt we’ll bar thee from succession not hold thee of our blood no not our kin far than deucalion off
thou churl for this time though full of our displeasure yet we free thee from the dead blow of it
and you enchantment worthy enough a herdsman yea him too that makes himself but for our honour therein unworthy thee
if ever henceforth thou these rural latches to his entrance open or hoop his body more with thy embraces i will devise a death as cruel for thee as thou art tender to ’t
i was not much afeard for once or twice i was about to speak and tell him plainly the selfsame sun that shines upon his court hides not his visage from our cottage but looks on alike
to florizel will’t please you sir be gone
i told you what would come of this
beseech you of your own state take care
this dream of mine— being now awake i’ll queen it no inch farther but milk my ewes and weep
i cannot speak nor think nor dare to know that which i know
o sir you have undone a man of fourscore three that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea to die upon the bed my father died to lie close by his honest bones but now some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me where no priest shovels in dust
o cursed wretch that knew’st this was the prince and wouldst adventure to mingle faith with him
if i might die within this hour i have liv’d to die when i desire
why look you so upon me
i am but sorry not afeard delay’d but nothing alt’red what i was i am more straining on for plucking back not following my leash unwillingly
gracious my lord you know your father’s temper at this time he will allow no speech which i do guess you do not purpose to him and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet i fear then till the fury of his highness settle come not before him
how often have i told you ’twould be thus
how often said my dignity would last but till ’twere known
it cannot fail but by the violation of my faith and then let nature crush the sides o’ th’ earth together and mar the seeds within
from my succession wipe me father i am heir to my affection
i am and by my fancy
if my reason will thereto be obedient i have reason if not my senses better pleas’d with madness do bid it welcome
so call it but it does fulfil my vow
i needs must think it honesty
camillo not for bohemia nor the pomp that may be thereat glean’d for all the sun sees or the close earth wombs or the profound seas hides in unknown fathoms will i break my oath to this my fair belov’d
therefore i pray you as you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend when he shall miss me —as in faith i mean not to see him any more —cast your good counsels upon his passion let myself and fortune tug for the time to come
this you may know and so deliver i am put to sea with her whom here i cannot hold on shore and most opportune to her need i have a vessel rides fast by but not prepar’d for this design
what course i mean to hold shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor concern me the reporting
o my lord i would your spirit were easier for advice or stronger for your need
takes her aside to camillo i’ll hear you by and by
now were i happy if his going i could frame to serve my turn save him from danger do him love and honour purchase the sight again of dear sicilia and that unhappy king my master whom i so much thirst to see
now good camillo i am so fraught with curious business that i leave out ceremony
sir i think you have heard of my poor services i’ th’ love that i have borne your father
very nobly have you deserv’d it is my father’s music to speak your deeds not little of his care to have them recompens’d as thought on
well my lord if you may please to think i love the king and through him what’s nearest to him which is your gracious self embrace but my direction if your more ponderous and settled project may suffer alteration
on mine honour i’ll point you where you shall have such receiving as shall become your highness where you may enjoy your mistress from the whom i see there’s no disjunction to be made but by as heavens forfend your ruin
marry her and with my best endeavours in your absence your discontenting father strive to qualify and bring him up to liking
how camillo may this almost a miracle be done
that i may call thee something more than man and after that trust to thee
have you thought on a place whereto you’ll go
but as th’ unthought on accident is guilty to what we wildly do so we profess ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies of every wind that blows
then list to me this follows if you will not change your purpose but undergo this flight make for sicilia and there present yourself and your fair princess for so i see she must be ’fore leontes she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed
methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness as ’twere i’ th’ father’s person kisses the hands of your fresh princess o’er and o’er divides him ’twixt his unkindness and his kindness
th’ one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than thought or time
worthy camillo what colour for my visitation shall i hold up before him
sent by the king your father to greet him and to give him comforts
sir the manner of your bearing towards him with what you as from your father shall deliver things known betwixt us three i’ll write you down the which shall point you forth at every sitting what you must say that he shall not perceive but that you have your father’s bosom there and speak his very heart
i am bound to you there is some sap in this
a course more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpath’d waters undream’d shores most certain to miseries enough no hope to help you but as you shake off one to take another nothing so certain as your anchors who do their best office if they can but stay you where you’ll be loath to be
besides you know prosperity’s the very bond of love whose fresh complexion and whose heart together affliction alters
one of these is true i think affliction may subdue the cheek but not take in the mind
there shall not at your father’s house these seven years be born another such
my good camillo she is as forward of her breeding as she is i’ th’ rear our birth
i cannot say ’tis pity she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress to most that teach
your pardon sir for this i’ll blush you thanks
but o the thorns we stand upon
camillo preserver of my father now of me the medicine of our house how shall we do
we are not furnish’d like bohemia’s son nor shall appear in sicilia
my lord fear none of this
i think you know my fortunes do all lie there it shall be so my care to have you royally appointed as if the scene you play were mine
for instance sir that you may know you shall not want —one word
and trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman
i have sold all my trumpery
not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch table book ballad knife tape glove shoe tie bracelet horn ring to keep my pack from fasting
they throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture and what i saw to my good use i remembered
my clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket it was senseless ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse i would have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing no feeling but my sir’s song and admiring the nothing of it
so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the king’s son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not left a purse alive in the whole army
camillo florizel and perdita come forward
nay but my letters by this means being there so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
and those that you’ll procure from king leontes
all that you speak shows fair
seeing autolycus who have we here
we’ll make an instrument of this omit nothing may give us aid
aside if they have overheard me now —why hanging
fear not man here’s no harm intended to thee
i am a poor fellow sir
why be so still here’s nobody will steal that from thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly —thou must think there’s a necessity in’t—and change garments with this gentleman though the pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee there’s some boot
i am a poor fellow sir aside i know ye well enough
nay prithee dispatch the gentleman is half flayed already
aside i smell the trick on’t
indeed i have had earnest but i cannot with conscience take it
florizel and autolycus exchange garments fortunate mistress —let my prophecy come home to you —you must retire yourself into some covert
take your sweetheart’s hat and pluck it o’er your brows muffle your face dismantle you and as you can disliken the truth of your own seeming that you may for i do fear eyes over to shipboard get undescried
i see the play so lies that i must bear a part
should i now meet my father he would not call me son
nay you shall have no hat
giving it to perdita come lady come
o perdita what have we twain forgot
aside what i do next shall be to tell the king of this escape and whither they are bound wherein my hope is i shall so prevail to force him after in whose company i shall re view sicilia for whose sight i have a woman’s longing
thus we set on camillo to the sea side
exeunt florizel perdita and camillo autolycus
i understand the business i hear it
to have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for the other senses
i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive
what an exchange had this been without boot
what a boot is here with this exchange
sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do anything extempore
the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not do’t i hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am i constant to my profession
aside aside here is more matter for a hot brain every lane’s end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man work
see see what a man you are now
there is no other way but to tell the king she’s a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the king and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him
show those things you found about her those secret things all but what she has with her this being done let the law go whistle i warrant you
i will tell the king all every word yea and his son’s pranks too who i may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the king’s brother in law
indeed brother in law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by i know how much an ounce
well let us to the king there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard
aside i know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master
pray heartily he be at’ palace
aside though i am not naturally honest i am so sometimes by chance
let me pocket up my pedlar’s excrement
takes off his false beard how now rustics
to the palace an it like your worship
your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and anything that is fitting to be known
we are but plain fellows sir
a lie you are rough and hairy
it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie
your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner
are you a courtier an ’t like you sir
whether it like me or no i am a courtier
seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court
receives not thy nose court odour from me
reflect i not on thy baseness court contempt
think’st thou for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy business i am therefore no courtier
i am courtier cap a pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there
whereupon i command thee to open thy affair
my business sir is to the king
what advocate hast thou to him
i know not an ’t like you
advocate’s the court word for a pheasant
none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen
how bless’d are we that are not simple men
yet nature might have made me as these are therefore i will not disdain
this cannot be but a great courtier
his garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely
he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical a great man i’ll warrant i know by the picking on’s teeth
sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king and which he shall know within this hour if i may come to th’ speech of him
age thou hast lost thy labour
the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou beest capable of things serious thou must know the king is full of grief
so ’tis said sir about his son that should have married a shepherd’s daughter
if that shepherd be not in hand fast let him fly
the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster
not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though removed fifty times shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity yet it is necessary
an old sheep whistling rogue a ram tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace
some say he shall be stoned but that death is too soft for him say i
draw our throne into a sheepcote
all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
has the old man e’er a son sir do you hear an ’t like you sir
he has a son who shall be flayed alive then ’nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasp’s nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recovered again with aqua vitæ or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death
but what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smiled at their offences being so capital
tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the king
being something gently considered i’ll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits here is man shall do it
he seems to be of great authority close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand and no more ado
an ’t please you sir to undertake the business for us here is that gold i have
i’ll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you
after i have done what i promised
are you a party in this business
in some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful one i hope i shall not be flayed out of it
o that’s the case of the shepherd’s son
hang him he’ll be made an example
we must to the king and show our strange sights
he must know ’tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else
sir i will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed and remain as he says your pawn till it be brought you
walk before toward the sea side go on the right hand
i will but look upon the hedge and follow you
we are blessed in this man as i may say even blessed
let’s before as he bids us
he was provided to do us good
if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth
i am courted now with a double occasion gold and a means to do the prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement
i will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him
if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to ’t
to him will i present them
there may be matter in it
exit act v scene i sicilia
a room in the palace of leontes
enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and others
cleomenes sir you have done enough and have perform’d a saint like sorrow no fault could you make which you have not redeem’d indeed paid down more penitence than done trespass at the last do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself
whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man bred his hopes out of
if one by one you wedded all the world or from the all that are took something good to make a perfect woman she you kill’d would be unparallel’d
i did so but thou strik’st me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought
now good now say so but seldom
cleomenes not at all good lady
you might have spoken a thousand things that would have done the time more benefit and grac’d your kindness better
you are one of those would have him wed again
if you would not so you pity not the state nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name consider little what dangers by his highness’ fail of issue may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookers on
what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well
what holier than for royalty’s repair for present comfort and for future good to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow to ’t
there is none worthy respecting her that’s gone
besides the gods will have fulfill’d their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said is ’t not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found
which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant
’tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills
to leontes care not for issue the crown will find an heir
great alexander left his to th’ worthiest so his successor was like to be the best
good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour o that ever i had squar’d me to thy counsel
then even now i might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes have taken treasure from her lips — paulina
and left them more rich for what they yielded
no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better us’d would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we offenders now appear soul vexed and begin “why to me ” paulina
had she such power she had just cause
she had and would incense me to murder her i married
were i the ghost that walk’d i’d bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part in ’t you chose her then i’d shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that follow’d should be “remember mine ” leontes
stars stars and all eyes else dead coals
fear thou no wife i’ll have no wife paulina
will you swear never to marry but by my free leave
never paulina so be bless’d my spirit
then good my lords bear witness to his oath
cleomenes you tempt him over much
unless another as like hermione as is her picture affront his eye
yet if my lord will marry —if you will sir no remedy but you will —give me the office to choose you a queen she shall not be so young as was your former but she shall be such as walk’d your first queen’s ghost it should take joy to see her in your arms
my true paulina we shall not marry till thou bid’st us
that shall be when your first queen’s again in breath never till then
one that gives out himself prince florizel son of polixenes with his princess she the fairest i have yet beheld desires access to your high presence
he comes not like to his father’s greatness his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us ’tis not a visitation fram’d but forc’d by need and accident
but few and those but mean
his princess say you with him
ay the most peerless piece of earth i think that e’er the sun shone bright on
o hermione as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone so must thy grave give way to what’s seen now
sir you yourself have said and writ so —but your writing now is colder than that theme —‘she had not been nor was not to be equall’d’ thus your verse flow’d with her beauty once ’tis shrewdly ebb’d to say you have seen a better
pardon madam the one i have almost forgot —your pardon — the other when she has obtain’d your eye will have your tongue too
this is a creature would she begin a sect might quench the zeal of all professors else make proselytes of who she but bid follow
women will love her that she is a woman more worth than any man men that she is the rarest of all women
go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honour’d friends bring them to our embracement
exeunt cleomenes and others still ’tis strange he thus should steal upon us
had our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had pair’d well with this lord

your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you
were i but twenty one your father’s image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us perform’d before
i lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do
and then i lost — all mine own folly —the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him
by his command have i here touch’d sicilia and from him give you all greetings that a king at friend can send his brother and but infirmity which waits upon worn times hath something seiz’d his wish’d ability he had himself the lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his measur’d to look upon you whom he loves he bade me say so —more than all the sceptres and those that bear them living
o my brother — good gentleman —the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behind hand slackness
welcome hither as is the spring to the earth
and hath he too expos’d this paragon to the fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less th’ adventure of her person
good my lord she came from libya
where the warlike smalus that noble honour’d lord is fear’d and lov’d
most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter his tears proclaim’d his parting with her thence a prosperous south wind friendly we have cross’d to execute the charge my father gave me for visiting your highness my best train i have from your sicilian shores dismiss’d who for bohemia bend to signify not only my success in libya sir but my arrival and my wife’s in safety here where we are
the blessed gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here
you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless
and your father’s bless’d as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness
what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have look’d on such goodly things as you
most noble sir that which i shall report will bear no credit were not the proof so nigh
please you great sir bohemia greets you from himself by me desires you to attach his son who has— his dignity and duty both cast off— fled from his father from his hopes and with a shepherd’s daughter
here in your city i now came from him
i speak amazedly and it becomes my marvel and my message
to your court whiles he was hast’ning—in the chase it seems of this fair couple—meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady and her brother having both their country quitted with this young prince
camillo has betray’d me whose honour and whose honesty till now endur’d all weathers
lay ’t so to his charge
he’s with the king your father
camillo sir i spake with him who now has these poor men in question
never saw i wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth forswear themselves as often as they speak
bohemia stops his ears and threatens them with divers deaths in death
the heaven sets spies upon us will not have our contract celebrated
we are not sir nor are we like to be
the stars i see will kiss the valleys first

my lord is this the daughter of a king
she is when once she is my wife
that “once” i see by your good father’s speed will come on very slowly
i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her
dear look up though fortune visible an enemy should chase us with my father power no jot hath she to change our loves
beseech you sir remember since you ow’d no more to time than i do now with thought of such affections step forth mine advocate
at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles
would he do so i’d beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle
sir my liege your eye hath too much youth in ’t not a month ’fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now
i thought of her even in these looks i made
to florizel but your petition is yet unanswer’d
your honour not o’erthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make
beseech you sir were you present at this relation
i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child
i would most gladly know the issue of it
i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration
they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes
there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed
a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be
here comes a gentleman that happily knows more
nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the king’s daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad makers cannot be able to express it
here comes the lady paulina’s steward he can deliver you more
this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion
has the king found his heir
most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance
that which you hear you’ll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs
the mantle of queen hermione’s her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter
did you see the meeting of the two kings
then you have lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of
there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears
there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour
our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries “o thy mother thy mother ” then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son in law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns
i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it
what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child
like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open
he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherd’s son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows
what became of his bark and his followers
wrecked the same instant of their master’s death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found
but o the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina
she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled
she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing
the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted
one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queen’s death with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an “alas ” i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood
who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen it the woe had been universal
are they returned to the court
no the princess hearing of her mother’s statue which is in the keeping of paulina —a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer
thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup
i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house
shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
who would be thence that has the benefit of access
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge
now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head
i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what
but he at that time over fond of the shepherd’s daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much sea sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscover’d
but ’tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relish’d among my other discredits
here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
come boy i am past more children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born
you denied to fight with me this other day because i was no gentleman born
say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born
give me the lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born
i know you are now sir a gentleman born
ay and have been so any time these four hours
so you have but i was a gentleman born before my father for the king’s son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentleman like tears that ever we shed
we may live son to shed many more
ay or else ’twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are
i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master
prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen
ay an it like your good worship
give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia
you may say it but not swear it
not swear it now i am a gentleman
let boors and franklins say it i’ll swear it
how if it be false son
if it be ne’er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend
and i’ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but i’ll swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands
i will prove so sir to my power
ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not

o grave and good paulina the great comfort that i have had of thee
what sovereign sir i did not well i meant well
all my services you have paid home but that you have vouchsaf’d with your crown’d brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer
o paulina we honour you with trouble
but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we pass’d through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother
as she liv’d peerless so her dead likeness i do well believe excels whatever yet you look’d upon or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it lonely apart
but here it is prepare to see the life as lively mock’d as ever still sleep mock’d death
paulina undraws a curtain and discovers hermione standing as a statue
i like your silence it the more shows off your wonder but yet speak
chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace
but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so aged as this seems
so much the more our carver’s excellence which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she liv’d now
as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul
o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i woo’d her
i am asham’d does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it
o royal piece there’s magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjur’d to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee
and give me leave and do not say ’tis superstition that i kneel and then implore her blessing
lady dear queen that ended when i but began give me that hand of yours to kiss
the statue is but newly fix’d the colour’s not dry
my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on which sixteen winters cannot blow away so many summers dry
scarce any joy did ever so long live no sorrow but kill’d itself much sooner
dear my brother let him that was the cause of this have power to take off so much grief from you as he will piece up in himself
indeed my lord if i had thought the sight of my poor image would thus have wrought you—for the stone is mine— i’d not have show’d it
no longer shall you gaze on’t lest your fancy may think anon it moves
would i were dead but that methinks already— what was he that did make it
see my lord would you not deem it breath’d
and that those veins did verily bear blood
masterly done the very life seems warm upon her lip
the fixture of her eye has motion in ’t as we are mock’d with art
i’ll draw the curtain my lord’s almost so far transported that he’ll think anon it lives
o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together
no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness
i am sorry sir i have thus far stirr’d you but i could afflict you further
do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort
still methinks there is an air comes from her
what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath
let no man mock me for i will kiss her
good my lord forbear the ruddiness upon her lip is wet you’ll mar it if you kiss it stain your own with oily painting
so long could i stand by a looker on
either forbear quit presently the chapel or resolve you for more amazement
if you can behold it i’ll make the statue move indeed descend and take you by the hand
but then you’ll think which i protest against i am assisted by wicked powers
what you can make her do i am content to look on what to speak i am content to hear for ’tis as easy to make her speak as move
it is requir’d you do awake your faith
then all stand still or those that think it is unlawful business i am about let them depart
music ’tis time descend be stone no more approach strike all that look upon with marvel
come i’ll fill your grave up stir nay come away
bequeath to death your numbness for from him dear life redeems you
hermione comes down from the pedestal
start not her actions shall be holy as you hear my spell is lawful
do not shun her until you see her die again for then you kill her double
nay present your hand when she was young you woo’d her now in age is she become the suitor
if this be magic let it be an art lawful as eating
if she pertain to life let her speak too
ay and make it manifest where she has liv’d or how stol’n from the dead
that she is living were it but told you should be hooted at like an old tale but it appears she lives though yet she speak not

good paulina lead us from hence where we may leisurely each one demand and answer to his part perform’d in this wide gap of time since first we were dissever’d
exeunt a lover’s complaint from off a hill whose concave womb reworded a plaintful story from a sist’ring vale my spirits t’attend this double voice accorded and down i laid to list the sad tun’d tale ere long espied a fickle maid full pale tearing of papers breaking rings a twain storming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain
upon her head a platted hive of straw which fortified her visage from the sun whereon the thought might think sometime it saw the carcass of a beauty spent and done time had not scythed all that youth begun nor youth all quit but spite of heaven’s fell rage some beauty peeped through lattice of sear’d age
oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne which on it had conceited characters laund’ring the silken figures in the brine that seasoned woe had pelleted in tears and often reading what contents it bears as often shrieking undistinguish’d woe in clamours of all size both high and low
sometimes her levell’d eyes their carriage ride as they did batt’ry to the spheres intend sometime diverted their poor balls are tied to th’orbed earth sometimes they do extend their view right on anon their gazes lend to every place at once and nowhere fix’d the mind and sight distractedly commix’d
her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat proclaim’d in her a careless hand of pride for some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat hanging her pale and pined cheek beside some in her threaden fillet still did bide and true to bondage would not break from thence though slackly braided in loose negligence
a thousand favours from a maund she drew of amber crystal and of beaded jet which one by one she in a river threw upon whose weeping margent she was set like usury applying wet to wet or monarchs’ hands that lets not bounty fall where want cries ‘some ’ but where excess begs ‘all’
of folded schedules had she many a one which she perus’d sigh’d tore and gave the flood crack’d many a ring of posied gold and bone bidding them find their sepulchres in mud found yet mo letters sadly penn’d in blood with sleided silk feat and affectedly enswath’d and seal’d to curious secrecy
these often bath’d she in her fluxive eyes and often kiss’d and often gave to tear cried ‘o false blood thou register of lies what unapproved witness dost thou bear

so slides he down upon his grained bat and comely distant sits he by her side when he again desires her being sat her grievance with his hearing to divide if that from him there may be aught applied which may her suffering ecstasy assuage ’tis promised in the charity of age
‘father ’ she says ‘though in me you behold the injury of many a blasting hour let it not tell your judgement i am old not age but sorrow over me hath power
i might as yet have been a spreading flower fresh to myself if i had self applied love to myself and to no love beside
too early i attended a youthful suit it was to gain my grace o one by nature’s outwards so commended that maiden’s eyes stuck over all his face love lack’d a dwelling and made him her place and when in his fair parts she did abide she was new lodg’d and newly deified
‘his browny locks did hang in crooked curls and every light occasion of the wind upon his lips their silken parcels hurls what’s sweet to do to do will aptly find each eye that saw him did enchant the mind for on his visage was in little drawn what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn
‘small show of man was yet upon his chin his phoenix down began but to appear like unshorn velvet on that termless skin whose bare out bragg’d the web it seemed to wear

how many tales to please me hath she coin d dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing
yet in the midst of all her pure protestings her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings
she burn d with love as straw with fire flameth she burn d out love as soon as straw outburneth she fram d the love and yet she foil d the framing she bade love last and yet she fell a turning
was this a lover or a lecher whether
bad in the best though excellent in neither
if music and sweet poetry agree as they must needs the sister and the brother then must the love be great twixt thee and me because thou lovest the one and i the other
dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch upon the lute doth ravish human sense spenser to me whose deep conceit is such as passing all conceit needs no defence
thou lov st to hear the sweet melodious sound that phoebus lute the queen of music makes and i in deep delight am chiefly drown d whenas himself to singing he betakes
one god is god of both as poets feign one knight loves both and both in thee remain
fair was the morn when the fair queen of love paler for sorrow than her milk white dove for adon s sake a youngster proud and wild her stand she takes upon a steep up hill anon adonis comes with horn and hounds she silly queen with more than love s good will forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds once quoth she did i see a fair sweet youth here in these brakes deep wounded with a boar deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth
see in my thigh quoth she here was the sore
she showed hers he saw more wounds than one and blushing fled and left her all alone
sweet rose fair flower untimely pluck d soon vaded pluck d in the bud and vaded in the spring
fair creature kill d too soon by death s sharp sting
like a green plum that hangs upon a tree and falls through wind before the fall should be
i weep for thee and yet no cause i have for why
thou left st me nothing in thy will and yet thou left st me more than i did crave for why
i craved nothing of thee still o yes dear friend i pardon crave of thee thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me
venus with young adonis sitting by her under a myrtle shade began to woo him she told the youngling how god mars did try her and as he fell to her so fell she to him
even thus quoth she the warlike god embrac d me and then she clipp d adonis in her arms even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me as if the boy should use like loving charms even thus quoth she he seized on my lips and with her lips on his did act the seizure and as she fetched breath away he skips and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
that i had my lady at this bay to kiss and clip me till i run away

beauty is but a vain and doubtful good a shining gloss that vadeth suddenly a flower that dies when first it gins to bud a brittle glass that s broken presently a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower lost vaded broken dead within an hour
and as goods lost are seld or never found as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh as flowers dead lie wither d on the ground as broken glass no cement can redress so beauty blemish d once for ever s lost in spite of physic painting pain and cost
neither be my share she bade good night that kept my rest away and daff d me to a cabin hang d with care to descant on the doubts of my decay
farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow fare well i could not for i supp d with sorrow yet at my parting sweetly did she smile in scorn or friendship nill i construe whether t may be she joy d to jest at my exile t may be again to make me wander thither wander a word for shadows like myself as take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf
lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east
my heart doth charge the watch the morning rise doth cite each moving sense from idle rest
not daring trust the office of mine eyes while philomela sits and sings i sit and mark and wish her lays were tuned like the lark for she doth welcome daylight with her ditty and drives away dark dismal dreaming night the night so pack d i post unto my pretty heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight sorrow chang d to solace solace mix d with sorrow for why she sigh d and bade me come tomorrow
were i with her the night would post too soon but now are minutes added to the hours to spite me now each minute seems a moon yet not for me shine sun to succour flowers
pack night peep day good day of night now borrow short night to night and length thyself to morrow
the phoenix and the turtle let the bird of loudest lay on the sole arabian tree herald sad and trumpet be to whose sound chaste wings obey
but thou shrieking harbinger foul precurrer of the fiend augur of the fever’s end to this troop come thou not near
from this session interdict every fowl of tyrant wing save the eagle feather’d king keep the obsequy so strict
let the priest in surplice white that defunctive music can be the death divining swan lest the requiem lack his right
and thou treble dated crow that thy sable gender mak’st with the breath thou giv’st and tak’st ’mongst our mourners shalt thou go
here the anthem doth commence love and constancy is dead phoenix and the turtle fled in a mutual flame from hence
so they lov’d as love in twain had the essence but in one two distincts division none number there in love was slain
hearts remote yet not asunder distance and no space was seen ’twixt this turtle and his queen but in them it were a wonder
so between them love did shine that the turtle saw his right flaming in the phoenix’ sight either was the other’s mine
property was thus appalled that the self was not the same single nature’s double name neither two nor one was called
reason in itself confounded saw division grow together to themselves yet either neither simple were so well compounded
that it cried how true a twain seemeth this concordant one
love hath reason reason none if what parts can so remain
whereupon it made this threne to the phoenix and the dove co supremes and stars of love as chorus to their tragic scene
grace in all simplicity here enclos’d in cinders lie
death is now the phoenix’ nest and the turtle’s loyal breast to eternity doth rest
leaving no posterity — ’twas not their infirmity it was married chastity
truth may seem but cannot be beauty brag but ’tis not she truth and beauty buried be
to this urn let those repair that are either true or fair for these dead birds sigh a prayer

lucius tarquinius for his excessive pride surnamed superbus after he had caused his own father in law servius tullius to be cruelly murdered and contrary to the roman laws and customs not requiring or staying for the people s suffrages had possessed himself of the kingdom went accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of rome to besiege ardea
during which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of sextus tarquinius the king s son in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife among whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife lucretia
in that pleasant humour they all posted to rome and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched only collatinus finds his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or in several disports
whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus the victory and his wife the fame
at that time sextus tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece s beauty yet smothering his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by lucrece at collatium
the same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the morning speedeth away
lucrece in this lamentable plight hastily dispatched messengers one to rome for her father another to the camp for collatine
they came the one accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause of her sorrow
she first taking an oath of them for her revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and withal suddenly stabbed herself
which done with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the people were so moved that with one consent and a general acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state government changed from kings to consuls
from the besieged ardea all in post borne by the trustless wings of false desire lust breathed tarquin leaves the roman host and to collatium bears the lightless fire which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire and girdle with embracing flames the waist of collatine s fair love lucrece the chaste
haply that name of chaste unhapp ly set this bateless edge on his keen appetite when collatine unwisely did not let to praise the clear unmatched red and white which triumph d in that sky of his delight where mortal stars as bright as heaven s beauties with pure aspects did him peculiar duties
for he the night before in tarquin s tent unlock d the treasure of his happy state what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent in the possession of his beauteous mate reckoning his fortune at such high proud rate that kings might be espoused to more fame but king nor peer to such a peerless dame
o happiness enjoy d but of a few
and if possess d as soon decay d and done as is the morning s silver melting dew against the golden splendour of the sun
an expir d date cancell d ere well begun honour and beauty in the owner s arms are weakly fortress d from a world of harms
beauty itself doth of itself persuade the eyes of men without an orator what needeth then apologies be made to set forth that which is so singular
or why is collatine the publisher of that rich jewel he should keep unknown from thievish ears because it is his own
perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty suggested this proud issue of a king for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be perchance that envy of so rich a thing braving compare disdainfully did sting his high pitch d thoughts that meaner men should vaunt that golden hap which their superiors want
but some untimely thought did instigate his all too timeless speed if none of those his honour his affairs his friends his state neglected all with swift intent he goes to quench the coal which in his liver glows
o rash false heat wrapp d in repentant cold thy hasty spring still blasts and ne er grows old
when at collatium this false lord arriv d well was he welcom d by the roman dame within whose face beauty and virtue striv d which of them both should underprop her fame when virtue bragg d beauty would blush for shame when beauty boasted blushes in despite virtue would stain that or with silver white
but beauty in that white intituled from venus doves doth challenge that fair field then virtue claims from beauty beauty s red which virtue gave the golden age to gild their silver cheeks and call d it then their shield teaching them thus to use it in the fight — when shame assail d the red should fence the white
this heraldry in lucrece face was seen argued by beauty s red and virtue s white of either s colour was the other queen proving from world s minority their right yet their ambition makes them still to fight the sovereignty of either being so great that oft they interchange each other s seat
their silent war of lilies and of roses which tarquin view d in her fair face s field in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses where lest between them both it should be kill d the coward captive vanquish d doth yield to those two armies that would let him go rather than triumph in so false a foe
now thinks he that her husband s shallow tongue the niggard prodigal that prais d her so in that high task hath done her beauty wrong which far exceeds his barren skill to show therefore that praise which collatine doth owe enchanted tarquin answers with surmise in silent wonder of still gazing eyes
but she that never cop d with stranger eyes could pick no meaning from their parling looks nor read the subtle shining secrecies writ in the glassy margents of such books she touch d no unknown baits nor fear d no hooks nor could she moralize his wanton sight more than his eyes were open d to the light
he stories to her ears her husband s fame won in the fields of fruitful italy and decks with praises collatine s high name made glorious by his manly chivalry with bruised arms and wreaths of victory her joy with heav d up hand she doth express and wordless so greets heaven for his success
far from the purpose of his coming hither he makes excuses for his being there
no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather doth yet in his fair welkin once appear till sable night mother of dread and fear upon the world dim darkness doth display and in her vaulty prison stows the day
for then is tarquin brought unto his bed intending weariness with heavy spright for after supper long he questioned with modest lucrece and wore out the night now leaden slumber with life s strength doth fight and every one to rest themselves betake save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake
as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving the sundry dangers of his will s obtaining yet ever to obtain his will resolving though weak built hopes persuade him to abstaining despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining and when great treasure is the meed propos d though death be adjunct there s no death suppos d
those that much covet are with gain so fond for what they have not that which they possess they scatter and unloose it from their bond and so by hoping more they have but less or gaining more the profit of excess is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain that they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain
the aim of all is but to nurse the life with honour wealth and ease in waning age and in this aim there is such thwarting strife that one for all or all for one we gage as life for honour in fell battles rage honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost the death of all and all together lost
so that in vent ring ill we leave to be the things we are for that which we expect and this ambitious foul infirmity in having much torments us with defect of that we have so then we do neglect the thing we have and all for want of wit make something nothing by augmenting it
such hazard now must doting tarquin make pawning his honour to obtain his lust and for himself himself he must forsake then where is truth if there be no self trust
when shall he think to find a stranger just when he himself himself confounds betrays to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days
now stole upon the time the dead of night when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes no comfortable star did lend his light no noise but owls and wolves death boding cries now serves the season that they may surprise the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still while lust and murder wake to stain and kill
and now this lustful lord leap d from his bed throwing his mantle rudely o er his arm is madly toss d between desire and dread th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm but honest fear bewitch d with lust s foul charm doth too too oft betake him to retire beaten away by brain sick rude desire
his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth which must be lode star to his lustful eye and to the flame thus speaks advisedly as from this cold flint i enforced this fire so lucrece must i force to my desire
here pale with fear he doth premeditate the dangers of his loathsome enterprise and in his inward mind he doth debate what following sorrow may on this arise then looking scornfully he doth despise his naked armour of still slaughter d lust and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not to darken her whose light excelleth thine and die unhallow d thoughts before you blot with your uncleanness that which is divine
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine let fair humanity abhor the deed that spots and stains love s modest snow white weed
o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
o foul dishonour to my household s grave
o impious act including all foul harms
a martial man to be soft fancy s slave
true valour still a true respect should have then my digression is so vile so base that it will live engraven in my face
yea though i die the scandal will survive and be an eye sore in my golden coat some loathsome dash the herald will contrive to cipher me how fondly i did dote that my posterity sham d with the note shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin to wish that i their father had not been
what win i if i gain the thing i seek
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy who buys a minute s mirth to wail a week
or sells eternity to get a toy
for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
if collatinus dream of my intent will he not wake and in a desperate rage post hither this vile purpose to prevent
this siege that hath engirt his marriage this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage this dying virtue this surviving shame whose crime will bear an ever during blame
o what excuse can my invention make when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed
the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly but coward like with trembling terror die
had collatinus kill d my son or sire or lain in ambush to betray my life or were he not my dear friend this desire might have excuse to work upon his wife as in revenge or quittal of such strife but as he is my kinsman my dear friend the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end
shameful it is —ay if the fact be known hateful it is — there is no hate in loving i ll beg her love —but she is not her own the worst is but denial and reproving my will is strong past reason s weak removing
who fears a sentence or an old man s saw shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe
thus graceless holds he disputation tween frozen conscience and hot burning will and with good thoughts makes dispensation urging the worser sense for vantage still which in a moment doth confound and kill all pure effects and doth so far proceed that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed
quoth he she took me kindly by the hand and gaz d for tidings in my eager eyes fearing some hard news from the warlike band where her beloved collatinus lies
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses that on lawn we lay then white as lawn the roses took away
and how her hand in my hand being lock d forc d it to tremble with her loyal fear which struck her sad and then it faster rock d until her husband s welfare she did hear whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer that had narcissus seen her as she stood self love had never drown d him in the flood
why hunt i then for colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth affection is my captain and he leadeth and when his gaudy banner is display d the coward fights and will not be dismay d
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
my heart shall never countermand mine eye sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage my part is youth and beats these from the stage desire my pilot is beauty my prize then who fears sinking where such treasure lies
as corn o ergrown by weeds so heedful fear is almost chok d by unresisted lust
away he steals with opening listening ear full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust both which as servitors to the unjust so cross him with their opposite persuasion that now he vows a league and now invasion
within his thought her heavenly image sits and in the self same seat sits collatine that eye which looks on her confounds his wits that eye which him beholds as more divine unto a view so false will not incline but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart which once corrupted takes the worser part and therein heartens up his servile powers who flatter d by their leader s jocund show stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours and as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed
the locks between her chamber and his will each one by him enforc d retires his ward but as they open they all rate his ill which drives the creeping thief to some regard the threshold grates the door to have him heard night wand ring weasels shriek to see him there they fright him yet he still pursues his fear
but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him he in the worst sense construes their denial the doors the wind the glove that did delay him he takes for accidental things of trial or as those bars which stop the hourly dial who with a lingering stay his course doth let till every minute pays the hour his debt
so so quoth he these lets attend the time like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
to add a more rejoicing to the prime and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
pain pays the income of each precious thing huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands
now is he come unto the chamber door that shuts him from the heaven of his thought which with a yielding latch and with no more hath barr d him from the blessed thing he sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought that for his prey to pray he doth begin as if the heavens should countenance his sin
but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer having solicited the eternal power that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair and they would stand auspicious to the hour even there he starts —quoth he i must de flower the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact how can they then assist me in the act
then love and fortune be my gods my guide
my will is back d with resolution thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried the blackest sin is clear d with absolution against love s fire fear s frost hath dissolution
the eye of heaven is out and misty night covers the shame that follows sweet delight
this said his guilty hand pluck d up the latch and with his knee the door he opens wide the dove sleeps fast that this night owl will catch thus treason works ere traitors be espied
who sees the lurking serpent steps aside but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing lies at the mercy of his mortal sting
into the chamber wickedly he stalks and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
the curtains being close about he walks rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head by their high treason is his heart misled which gives the watch word to his hand full soon to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon
look as the fair and fiery pointed sun rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun to wink being blinded with a greater light whether it is that she reflects so bright that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed
o had they in that darksome prison died then had they seen the period of their ill
then collatine again by lucrece side in his clear bed might have reposed still but they must ope this blessed league to kill and holy thoughted lucrece to their sight must sell her joy her life her world s delight
her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss who therefore angry seems to part in sunder swelling on either side to want his bliss between whose hills her head entombed is where like a virtuous monument she lies to be admir d of lewd unhallow d eyes
without the bed her other fair hand was on the green coverlet whose perfect white show d like an april daisy on the grass with pearly sweat resembling dew of night her eyes like marigolds had sheath d their light and canopied in darkness sweetly lay till they might open to adorn the day
her hair like golden threads play d with her breath o modest wantons
showing life s triumph in the map of death and death s dim look in life s mortality each in her sleep themselves so beautify as if between them twain there were no strife but that life liv d in death and death in life
her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue a pair of maiden worlds unconquered save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew and him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred who like a foul usurper went about from this fair throne to heave the owner out
what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desir d
what he beheld on that he firmly doted and in his will his wilful eye he tir d
with more than admiration he admir d her azure veins her alabaster skin her coral lips her snow white dimpled chin
as the grim lion fawneth o er his prey sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied so o er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay his rage of lust by grazing qualified slack d not suppress d for standing by her side his eye which late this mutiny restrains unto a greater uproar tempts his veins and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting obdurate vassals
fell exploits effecting in bloody death and ravishment delighting nor children s tears nor mothers groans respecting swell in their pride the onset still expecting anon his beating heart alarum striking gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye his eye commends the leading to his hand his hand as proud of such a dignity smoking with pride march d on to make his stand on her bare breast the heart of all her land whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale left their round turrets destitute and pale
they mustering to the quiet cabinet where their dear governess and lady lies do tell her she is dreadfully beset and fright her with confusion of their cries she much amaz d breaks ope her lock d up eyes who peeping forth this tumult to behold are by his flaming torch dimm d and controll d
imagine her as one in dead of night from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking what terror tis
but she in worser taking from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view the sight which makes supposed terror true
wrapp d and confounded in a thousand fears like to a new kill d bird she trembling lies she dares not look yet winking there appears quick shifting antics ugly in her eyes such shadows are the weak brain s forgeries who angry that the eyes fly from their lights in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
his hand that yet remains upon her breast rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heart poor citizen distress d wounding itself to death rise up and fall beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
this moves in him more rage and lesser pity to make the breach and enter this sweet city
first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin to sound a parley to his heartless foe who o er the white sheet peers her whiter chin the reason of this rash alarm to know which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show but she with vehement prayers urgeth still under what colour he commits this ill
thus he replies the colour in thy face that even for anger makes the lily pale and the red rose blush at her own disgrace shall plead for me and tell my loving tale under that colour am i come to scale thy never conquer d fort the fault is thine for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night where thou with patience must my will abide my will that marks thee for my earth s delight which i to conquer sought with all my might but as reproof and reason beat it dead by thy bright beauty was it newly bred
i see what crosses my attempt will bring i know what thorns the growing rose defends i think the honey guarded with a sting all this beforehand counsel comprehends but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty
i have debated even in my soul what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed but nothing can affection s course control or stop the headlong fury of his speed
i know repentant tears ensue the deed reproach disdain and deadly enmity yet strike i to embrace mine infamy
this said he shakes aloft his roman blade which like a falcon towering in the skies coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies so under his insulting falchion lies harmless lucretia marking what he tells with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon s bells
lucrece quoth he this night i must enjoy thee if thou deny then force must work my way for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee that done some worthless slave of thine i ll slay
to kill thine honour with thy life s decay and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him
so thy surviving husband shall remain the scornful mark of every open eye thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain thy issue blurr d with nameless bastardy and thou the author of their obloquy shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes and sung by children in succeeding times
but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend the fault unknown is as a thought unacted a little harm done to a great good end for lawful policy remains enacted
the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted in a pure compound being so applied his venom in effect is purified
then for thy husband and thy children s sake tender my suit bequeath not to their lot the shame that from them no device can take the blemish that will never be forgot worse than a slavish wipe or birth hour s blot for marks descried in men s nativity are nature s faults not their own infamy
here with a cockatrice dead killing eye he rouseth up himself and makes a pause while she the picture of pure piety like a white hind under the grype s sharp claws pleads in a wilderness where are no laws to the rough beast that knows no gentle right nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
but when a black fac d cloud the world doth threat in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding from earth s dark womb some gentle gust doth get which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding hindering their present fall by this dividing so his unhallow d haste her words delays and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
yet foul night working cat he doth but dally while in his hold fast foot the weak mouse panteth her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth no penetrable entrance to her plaining tears harden lust though marble wear with raining
her pity pleading eyes are sadly fix d in the remorseless wrinkles of his face her modest eloquence with sighs is mix d which to her oratory adds more grace
she puts the period often from his place and midst the sentence so her accent breaks that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
she conjures him by high almighty jove by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship s oath by her untimely tears her husband s love by holy human law and common troth by heaven and earth and all the power of both that to his borrow d bed he make retire and stoop to honour not to foul desire
quoth she reward not hospitality with such black payment as thou hast pretended mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee mar not the thing that cannot be amended end thy ill aim before the shoot be ended he is no woodman that doth bend his bow to strike a poor unseasonable doe
my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me myself a weakling do not then ensnare me thou look st not like deceit do not deceive me my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
if ever man were mov d with woman s moans be moved with my tears my sighs my groans all which together like a troubled ocean beat at thy rocky and wreck threatening heart to soften it with their continual motion for stones dissolv d to water do convert
o if no harder than a stone thou art melt at my tears and be compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate
in tarquin s likeness i did entertain thee hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
to all the host of heaven i complain me thou wrong st his honour wound st his princely name
thou art not what thou seem st and if the same thou seem st not what thou art a god a king for kings like gods should govern every thing
how will thy shame be seeded in thine age when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if in thy hope thou dar st do such outrage what dar st thou not when once thou art a king
o be remember d no outrageous thing from vassal actors can he wip d away then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay
this deed will make thee only lov d for fear but happy monarchs still are fear d for love with foul offenders thou perforce must bear when they in thee the like offences prove if but for fear of this thy will remove for princes are the glass the school the book where subjects eyes do learn do read do look
and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
must he in thee read lectures of such shame wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern authority for sin warrant for blame to privilege dishonour in thy name
thou back st reproach against long living laud and mak st fair reputation but a bawd
by him that gave it thee from a pure heart command thy rebel will draw not thy sword to guard iniquity for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfill when pattern d by thy fault foul sin may say he learn d to sin and thou didst teach the way
think but how vile a spectacle it were to view thy present trespass in another
men s faults do seldom to themselves appear their own transgressions partially they smother this guilt would seem death worthy in thy brother
o how are they wrapp d in with infamies that from their own misdeeds askaunce their eyes
to thee to thee my heav d up hands appeal not to seducing lust thy rash relier i sue for exil d majesty s repeal let him return and flattering thoughts retire his true respect will prison false desire and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine
have done quoth he my uncontrolled tide turns not but swells the higher by this let
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide and with the wind in greater fury fret the petty streams that pay a daily debt to their salt sovereign with their fresh falls haste add to his flow but alter not his taste
thou art quoth she a sea a sovereign king and lo there falls into thy boundless flood black lust dishonour shame misgoverning who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
if all these petty ills shall change thy good thy sea within a puddle s womb is hears d and not the puddle in thy sea dispers d
so shall these slaves be king and thou their slave thou nobly base they basely dignified thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride the lesser thing should not the greater hide the cedar stoops not to the base shrub s foot but low shrubs whither at the cedar s root
so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state — no more quoth he by heaven i will not hear thee yield to my love if not enforced hate instead of love s coy touch shall rudely tear thee that done despitefully i mean to bear thee unto the base bed of some rascal groom to be thy partner in this shameful doom
this said he sets his foot upon the light for light and lust are deadly enemies shame folded up in blind concealing night when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
the wolf hath seiz d his prey the poor lamb cries till with her own white fleece her voice controll d entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold for with the nightly linen that she wears he pens her piteous clamours in her head cooling his hot face in the chastest tears that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
the spots whereof could weeping purify her tears should drop on them perpetually
but she hath lost a dearer thing than life and he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force a further strife this momentary joy breeds months of pain this hot desire converts to cold disdain pure chastity is rifled of her store and lust the thief far poorer than before
look as the full fed hound or gorged hawk unapt for tender smell or speedy flight make slow pursuit or altogether balk the prey wherein by nature they delight so surfeit taking tarquin fares this night his taste delicious in digestion souring devours his will that liv d by foul devouring
o deeper sin than bottomless conceit can comprehend in still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt ere he can see his own abomination
while lust is in his pride no exclamation can curb his heat or rein his rash desire till like a jade self will himself doth tire
and then with lank and lean discolour d cheek with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace feeble desire all recreant poor and meek like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace for there it revels and when that decays the guilty rebel for remission prays
so fares it with this faultful lord of rome who this accomplishment so hotly chas d for now against himself he sounds this doom that through the length of times he stands disgrac d besides his soul s fair temple is defac d to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares to ask the spotted princess how she fares
she says her subjects with foul insurrection have batter d down her consecrated wall and by their mortal fault brought in subjection her immortality and made her thrall to living death and pain perpetual which in her prescience she controlled still but her foresight could not forestall their will
even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth a captive victor that hath lost in gain bearing away the wound that nothing healeth the scar that will despite of cure remain leaving his spoil perplex d in greater pain
she hears the load of lust he left behind and he the burthen of a guilty mind
he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence she like a wearied lamb lies panting there he scowls and hates himself for his offence she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear he faintly flies sweating with guilty fear she stays exclaiming on the direful night he runs and chides his vanish d loath d delight
he thence departs a heavy convertite she there remains a hopeless castaway he in his speed looks for the morning light she prays she never may behold the day for day quoth she night s scapes doth open lay and my true eyes have never practis d how to cloak offences with a cunning brow
they think not but that every eye can see the same disgrace which they themselves behold and therefore would they still in darkness be to have their unseen sin remain untold for they their guilt with weeping will unfold and grave like water that doth eat in steel upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel
here she exclaims against repose and rest and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
she wakes her heart by beating on her breast and bids it leap from thence where it may find some purer chest to close so pure a mind
frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite against the unseen secrecy of night o comfort killing night image of hell
dim register and notary of shame
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
grim cave of death whispering conspirator with close tongued treason and the ravisher
o hateful vaporous and foggy night
since thou art guilty of my cureless crime muster thy mists to meet the eastern light make war against proportion d course of time
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb his wonted height yet ere he go to bed knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
with rotten damps ravish the morning air let their exhal d unwholesome breaths make sick the life of purity the supreme fair ere he arrive his weary noontide prick and let thy misty vapours march so thick that in their smoky ranks his smother d light may set at noon and make perpetual night
were tarquin night as he is but night s child the silver shining queen he would distain her twinkling handmaids too by him defil d through night s black bosom should not peep again so should i have co partners in my pain and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage
where now i have no one to blush with me to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine to mask their brows and hide their infamy but i alone alone must sit and pine seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans poor wasting monuments of lasting moans
o night thou furnace of foul reeking smoke let not the jealous day behold that face which underneath thy black all hiding cloak immodesty lies martyr d with disgrace
keep still possession of thy gloomy place that all the faults which in thy reign are made may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade
make me not object to the tell tale day
the light will show character d in my brow the story of sweet chastity s decay the impious breach of holy wedlock vow yea the illiterate that know not how to cipher what is writ in learned books will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks
the nurse to still her child will tell my story and fright her crying babe with tarquin s name the orator to deck his oratory will couple my reproach to tarquin s shame feast finding minstrels tuning my defame will tie the hearers to attend each line how tarquin wronged me i collatine
let my good name that senseless reputation for collatine s dear love be kept unspotted if that be made a theme for disputation the branches of another root are rotted and undeserved reproach to him allotted that is as clear from this attaint of mine as i ere this was pure to collatine
reproach is stamp d in collatinus face and tarquin s eye may read the mot afar how he in peace is wounded not in war
alas how many bear such shameful blows which not themselves but he that gives them knows
if collatine thine honour lay in me from me by strong assault it is bereft
my honey lost and i a drone like bee have no perfection of my summer left but robb d and ransack d by injurious theft in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept and suck d the honey which thy chaste bee kept
yet am i guilty of thy honour s wrack — yet for thy honour did i entertain him coming from thee i could not put him back for it had been dishonour to disdain him besides of weariness he did complain him and talk d of virtue —o unlook d for evil when virtue is profan d in such a devil
why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests
or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
or kings be breakers of their own behests
but no perfection is so absolute that some impurity doth not pollute
the aged man that coffers up his gold is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold but like still pining tantalus he sits and useless barns the harvest of his wits having no other pleasure of his gain but torment that it cannot cure his pain
so then he hath it when he cannot use it and leaves it to be master d by his young who in their pride do presently abuse it their father was too weak and they too strong to hold their cursed blessed fortune long
the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours even in the moment that we call them ours
unruly blasts wait on the tender spring unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing what virtue breeds iniquity devours we have no good that we can say is ours but ill annexed opportunity or kills his life or else his quality
o opportunity thy guilt is great tis thou that executest the traitor s treason thou set st the wolf where he the lamb may get whoever plots the sin thou point st the season tis thou that spurn st at right at law at reason and in thy shady cell where none may spy him sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him
thou mak st the vestal violate her oath thou blow st the fire when temperance is thaw d thou smother st honesty thou murther st troth thou foul abettor
thou plantest scandal and displacest laud thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief
thy secret pleasure turns to open shame thy private feasting to a public fast thy smoothing titles to a ragged name thy sugar d tongue to bitter wormwood taste thy violent vanities can never last
how comes it then vile opportunity being so bad such numbers seek for thee
when wilt thou be the humble suppliant s friend and bring him where his suit may be obtain d
when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain d
give physic to the sick ease to the pain d
the poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee but they ne er meet with opportunity
the patient dies while the physician sleeps the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds justice is feasting while the widow weeps advice is sporting while infection breeds thou grant st no time for charitable deeds wrath envy treason rape and murder s rages thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages
when truth and virtue have to do with thee a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid they buy thy help but sin ne er gives a fee he gratis comes and thou art well appay d as well to hear as grant what he hath said
my collatine would else have come to me when tarquin did but he was stay d by thee
guilty thou art of murder and of theft guilty of perjury and subornation guilty of treason forgery and shift guilty of incest that abomination an accessory by thine inclination to all sins past and all that are to come from the creation to the general doom
mis shapen time copesmate of ugly night swift subtle post carrier of grisly care eater of youth false slave to false delight base watch of woes sin s pack horse virtue s snare thou nursest all and murtherest all that are o hear me then injurious shifting time
be guilty of my death since of my crime
why hath thy servant opportunity betray d the hours thou gav st me to repose
cancell d my fortunes and enchained me to endless date of never ending woes
time s office is to fine the hate of foes to eat up errors by opinion bred not spend the dowry of a lawful bed
why work st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage unless thou couldst return to make amends
one poor retiring minute in an age would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends lending him wit that to bad debtors lends o this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack
thou cease ess lackey to eternity with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight devise extremes beyond extremity to make him curse this cursed crimeful night let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright and the dire thought of his committed evil shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil
disturb his hours of rest with restless trances afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans let there bechance him pitiful mischances to make him moan but pity not his moans stone him with harden d hearts harder than stones and let mild women to him lose their mildness wilder to him than tigers in their wildness
let him have time to tear his curled hair let him have time against himself to rave let him have time of time s help to despair let him have time to live a loathed slave let him have time a beggar s orts to crave and time to see one that by alms doth live disdain to him disdained scraps to give
let him have time to see his friends his foes and merry fools to mock at him resort let him have time to mark how slow time goes in time of sorrow and how swift and short his time of folly and his time of sport and ever let his unrecalling crime have time to wail the abusing of his time
o time thou tutor both to good and bad teach me to curse him that thou taught st this ill
at his own shadow let the thief run mad
himself himself seek every hour to kill
such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill for who so base would such an office have as slanderous deathsman to so base a slave
the baser is he coming from a king to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
the mightier man the mightier is the thing that makes him honour d or begets him hate for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
the moon being clouded presently is miss d but little stars may hide them when they list
the crow may bathe his coal black wings in mire and unperceived fly with the filth away but if the like the snow white swan desire the stain upon his silver down will stay
poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day gnats are unnoted wheresoe er they fly but eagles gazed upon with every eye
out idle words servants to shallow fools
busy yourselves in skill contending schools debate where leisure serves with dull debaters to trembling clients be you mediators for me i force not argument a straw since that my case is past the help of law
in vain i rail at opportunity at time at tarquin and uncheerful night in vain i cavil with mine infamy in vain i spurn at my confirm d despite this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
the remedy indeed to do me good is to let forth my foul defil d blood
poor hand why quiver st thou at this decree
honour thyself to rid me of this shame for if i die my honour lives in thee but if i live thou livest in my defame since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame and wast afear d to scratch her wicked foe kill both thyself and her for yielding so
this said from her be tumbled couch she starteth to find some desperate instrument of death but this no slaughter house no tool imparteth to make more vent for passage of her breath which thronging through her lips so vanisheth as smoke from aetna that in air consumes or that which from discharged cannon fumes
in vain quoth she i live and seek in vain some happy mean to end a hapless life
i fear d by tarquin s falchion to be slain yet for the self same purpose seek a knife but when i fear d i was a loyal wife so am i now —o no that cannot be of that true type hath tarquin rifled me
that is gone for which i sought to live and therefore now i need not fear to die
to clear this spot by death at least i give a badge of fame to slander s livery a dying life to living infamy poor helpless help the treasure stolen away to burn the guiltless casket where it lay
well well dear collatine thou shalt not know the stained taste of violated troth i will not wrong thy true affection so to flatter thee with an infringed oath this bastard graff shall never come to growth he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute that thou art doting father of his fruit
nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought nor laugh with his companions at thy state but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought basely with gold but stolen from forth thy gate
for me i am the mistress of my fate and with my trespass never will dispense till life to death acquit my forced offence
i will not poison thee with my attaint nor fold my fault in cleanly coin d excuses my sable ground of sin i will not paint to hide the truth of this false night s abuses my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices as from a mountain spring that feeds a dale shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale
by this lamenting philomel had ended the well tun d warble of her nightly sorrow and solemn night with slow sad gait descended to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see and therefore still in night would cloister d be
revealing day through every cranny spies and seems to point her out where she sits weeping to whom she sobbing speaks o eye of eyes why pryest thou through my window
leave thy peeping mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping brand not my forehead with thy piercing light for day hath nought to do what s done by night
thus cavils she with every thing she sees true grief is fond and testy as a child who wayward once his mood with nought agrees
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild continuance tames the one the other wild like an unpractis d swimmer plunging still with too much labour drowns for want of skill
so she deep drenched in a sea of care holds disputation with each thing she views and to herself all sorrow doth compare no object but her passion s strength renews and as one shifts another straight ensues sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words sometime tis mad and too much talk affords
the little birds that tune their morning s joy make her moans mad with their sweet melody
for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy sad souls are slain in merry company grief best is pleas d with grief s society true sorrow then is feelingly suffic d when with like semblance it is sympathiz d
tis double death to drown in ken of shore he ten times pines that pines beholding food to see the salve doth make the wound ache more great grief grieves most at that would do it good deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood who being stopp d the bounding banks o erflows grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows
you mocking birds quoth she your tunes entomb within your hollow swelling feather d breasts and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
my restless discord loves no stops nor rests a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears
come philomel that sing st of ravishment make thy sad grove in my dishevell d hair as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment so i at each sad strain will strain a tear and with deep groans the diapason bear for burthen wise i ll hum on tarquin still while thou on tereus descant st better skill
and whiles against a thorn thou bear st thy part to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i to imitate thee well against my heart will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye who if it wink shall thereon fall and die
these means as frets upon an instrument shall tune our heart strings to true languishment
and for poor bird thou sing st not in the day as shaming any eye should thee behold some dark deep desert seated from the way that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold will we find out and there we will unfold to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds
as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze wildly determining which way to fly or one encompass d with a winding maze that cannot tread the way out readily so with herself is she in mutiny to live or die which of the twain were better when life is sham d and death reproach s debtor
to kill myself quoth she alack
what were it but with my body my poor soul s pollution
they that lose half with greater patience bear it than they whose whole is swallow d in confusion
that mother tries a merciless conclusion who having two sweet babes when death takes one will slay the other and be nurse to none
my body or my soul which was the dearer when the one pure the other made divine
whose love of either to myself was nearer
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
the bark peel d from the lofty pine his leaves will wither and his sap decay so must my soul her bark being peel d away
her house is sack d her quiet interrupted her mansion batter d by the enemy her sacred temple spotted spoil d corrupted grossly engirt with daring infamy then let it not be call d impiety if in this blemish d fort i make some hole through which i may convey this troubled soul
yet die i will not till my collatine have heard the cause of my untimely death that he may vow in that sad hour of mine revenge on him that made me stop my breath
my stained blood to tarquin i ll bequeath which by him tainted shall for him be spent and as his due writ in my testament
my honour i ll bequeath unto the knife that wounds my body so dishonoured
tis honour to deprive dishonour d life the one will live the other being dead so of shame s ashes shall my fame be bred for in my death i murther shameful scorn my shame so dead mine honour is new born
dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
my resolution love shall be thy boast by whose example thou reveng d mayst be
how tarquin must be used read it in me myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so
this brief abridgement of my will i make my soul and body to the skies and ground my resolution husband do thou take mine honour be the knife s that makes my wound my shame be his that did my fame confound and all my fame that lives disburs d be to those that live and think no shame of me
thou collatine shalt oversee this will how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill my life s foul deed my life s fair end shall free it
faint not faint heart but stoutly say so be it yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee thou dead both die and both shall victors be
this plot of death when sadly she had laid and wip d the brinish pearl from her bright eyes with untun d tongue she hoarsely call d her maid whose swift obedience to her mistress hies for fleet wing d duty with thought s feathers flies
poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
her mistress she doth give demure good morrow with soft slow tongue true mark of modesty and sorts a sad look to her lady s sorrow for why her face wore sorrow s livery but durst not ask of her audaciously why her two suns were cloud eclipsed so nor why her fair cheeks over wash d with woe
but as the earth doth weep the sun being set each flower moisten d like a melting eye even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet her circled eyne enforc d by sympathy of those fair suns set in her mistress sky who in a salt wav d ocean quench their light which makes the maid weep like the dewy night
a pretty while these pretty creatures stand like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling one justly weeps the other takes in hand no cause but company of her drops spilling their gentle sex to weep are often willing grieving themselves to guess at others smarts and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
for men have marble women waxen minds and therefore are they form d as marble will the weak oppress d the impression of strange kinds is form d in them by force by fraud or skill then call them not the authors of their ill no more than wax shall be accounted evil wherein is stamp d the semblance of a devil
their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain lays open all the little worms that creep in men as in a rough grown grove remain cave keeping evils that obscurely sleep through crystal walls each little mote will peep though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks poor women s faces are their own faults books
no man inveigb against the wither d flower but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill d
not that devour d but that which doth devour is worthy blame
o let it not be hild poor women s faults that they are so fulfill d with men s abuses
those proud lords to blame make weak made women tenants to their shame
the precedent whereof in lucrece view assail d by night with circumstances strong of present death and shame that might ensue by that her death to do her husband wrong such danger to resistance did belong the dying fear through all her body spread and who cannot abuse a body dead
by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak to the poor counterfeit of her complaining my girl quoth she on what occasion break those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining
if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining know gentle wench it small avails my mood if tears could help mine own would do me good
but tell me girl when went — and there she stay d till after a deep groan tarquin from hence
madam ere i was up replied the maid the more to blame my sluggard negligence yet with the fault i thus far can dispense myself was stirring ere the break of day and ere i rose was tarquin gone away
but lady if your maid may be so bold she would request to know your heaviness
quoth lucrece if it should be told the repetition cannot make it less for more it is than i can well express and that deep torture may be call d a hell when more is felt than one hath power to tell
go get me hither paper ink and pen— yet save that labour for i have them here
what should i say —one of my husband s men bid thou be ready by and by to bear a letter to my lord my love my dear bid him with speed prepare to carry it the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ
her maid is gone and she prepares to write first hovering o er the paper with her quill conceit and grief an eager combat fight what wit sets down is blotted straight with will this is too curious good this blunt and ill much like a press of people at a door throng her inventions which shall go before
at last she thus begins — thou worthy lord of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee health to thy person
next vouchsafe to afford if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see some present speed to come and visit me so i commend me from our house in grief my woes are tedious though my words are brief
here folds she up the tenor of her woe her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know her grief but not her grief s true quality she dares not thereof make discovery lest he should hold it her own gross abuse ere she with blood had stain d her stain d excuse
besides the life and feeling of her passion she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion of her disgrace the better so to clear her from that suspicion which the world my might bear her
to shun this blot she would not blot the letter with words till action might become them better
to see sad sights moves more than hear them told for then the eye interprets to the ear the heavy motion that it doth behold when every part a part of woe doth bear
tis but a part of sorrow that we hear deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words
her letter now is seal d and on it writ at ardea to my lord with more than haste the post attends and she delivers it charging the sour fac d groom to hie as fast as lagging fowls before the northern blast
speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems extremely still urgeth such extremes
the homely villain court sies to her low and blushing on her with a steadfast eye receives the scroll without or yea or no and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie imagine every eye beholds their blame for lucrece thought he blush d to see her shame when silly groom
god wot it was defect of spirit life and bold audacity
such harmless creatures have a true respect to talk in deeds while others saucily promise more speed but do it leisurely even so this pattern of the worn out age pawn d honest looks but laid no words to gage
his kindled duty kindled her mistrust that two red fires in both their faces blaz d she thought he blush d as knowing tarquin s lust and blushing with him wistly on him gaz d her earnest eye did make him more amaz d the more saw the blood his cheeks replenish the more she thought he spied in her some blemish
but long she thinks till he return again and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
the weary time she cannot entertain for now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan that she her plaints a little while doth stay pausing for means to mourn some newer way
at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece of skilful painting made for priam s troy before the which is drawn the power of greece for helen s rape the city to destroy threat ning cloud kissing ilion with annoy which the conceited painter drew so proud as heaven it seem d to kiss the turrets bow d
a thousand lamentable objects there in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life many a dry drop seem d a weeping tear shed for the slaughter d husband by the wife the red blood reek d to show the painter s strife the dying eyes gleam d forth their ashy lights like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights
there might you see the labouring pioner begrim d with sweat and smeared all with dust and from the towers of troy there would appear the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust gazing upon the greeks with little lust such sweet observance in this work was had that one might see those far off eyes look sad
in great commanders grace and majesty you might behold triumphing in their faces in youth quick bearing and dexterity and here and there the painter interlaces pale cowards marching on with trembling paces which heartless peasants did so well resemble that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble
in ajax and ulysses o what art of physiognomy might one behold
the face of either cipher d either s heart their face their manners most expressly told in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour roll d but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent show d deep regard and smiling government
there pleading might you see grave nestor stand as t were encouraging the greeks to fight making such sober action with his hand that it beguiled attention charm d the sight in speech it seem d his beard all silver white wagg d up and down and from his lips did fly thin winding breath which purl d up to the sky
about him were a press of gaping faces which seem d to swallow up his sound advice all jointly listening but with several graces as if some mermaid did their ears entice some high some low the painter was so nice the scalps of many almost hid behind to jump up higher seem d to mock the mind
here one man s hand lean d on another s head his nose being shadow d by his neighbour s ear here one being throng d bears back all boll n and red another smother d seems to pelt and swear and in their rage such signs of rage they bear as but for loss of nestor s golden words it seem d they would debate with angry swords
to this well painted piece is lucrece come to find a face where all distress is stell d
many she sees where cares have carved some but none where all distress and dolour dwell d till she despairing hecuba beheld staring on priam s wounds with her old eyes which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies
in her the painter had anatomiz d time s ruin beauty s wrack and grim care s reign her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguis d of what she was no semblance did remain her blue blood chang d to black in every vein wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed show d life imprison d in a body dead
on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes and shapes her sorrow to the beldame s woes who nothing wants to answer her but cries and bitter words to ban her cruel foes the painter was no god to lend her those and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong to give her so much grief and not a tongue
poor instrument quoth she without a sound i ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue and drop sweet balm in priam s painted wound and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong and with my tears quench troy that burns so long and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes of all the greeks that are thine enemies
show me the strumpet that began this stir that with my nails her beauty i may tear
thy heat of lust fond paris did incur this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here and here in troy for trespass of thine eye the sire the son the dame and daughter die
why should the private pleasure of some one become the public plague of many mo
let sin alone committed light alone upon his head that hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe for one s offence why should so many fall to plague a private sin in general
lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies here manly hector faints here troilus swounds here friend by friend in bloody channel lies and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds and one man s lust these many lives confounds had doting priam check d his son s desire troy had been bright with fame and not with fire
here feelingly she weeps troy s painted woes for sorrow like a heavy hanging bell once set on ringing with his own weight goes then little strength rings out the doleful knell so lucrece set a work sad tales doth tell to pencill d pensiveness and colour d sorrow she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow
she throws her eyes about the painting round and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament at last she sees a wretched image bound that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent his face though full of cares yet show d content onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes so mild that patience seem d to scorn his woes
in him the painter labour d with his skill to hide deceit and give the harmless show an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still a brow unbent that seem d to welcome woe cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so that blushing red no guilty instance gave nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have
but like a constant and confirmed devil he entertain d a show so seeming just and therein so ensconc d his secret evil that jealousy itself cold not mistrust false creeping craft and perjury should thrust into so bright a day such black fac d storms or blot with hell born sin such saint like forms
the well skill d workman this mild image drew for perjur d sinon whose enchanting story the credulous old priam after slew whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory of rich built ilion that the skies were sorry and little stars shot from their fixed places when their glass fell wherein they view d their faces
this picture she advisedly perus d and chid the painter for his wondrous skill saying some shape in sinon s was abus d so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill and still on him she gaz d and gazing still such signs of truth in his plain face she spied that she concludes the picture was belied
look look how listening priam wets his eyes to see those borrow d tears that sinon sheds
priam why art thou old and yet not wise
for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
such devils steal effects from lightless hell for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold and in that cold hot burning fire doth dwell these contraries such unity do hold only to flatter fools and make them bold so priam s trust false sinon s tears doth flatter that he finds means to burn his troy with water
here all enrag d such passion her assails that patience is quite beaten from her breast
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails comparing him to that unhappy guest whose deed hath made herself herself detest at last she smilingly with this gives o er fool fool
quoth she his wounds will not be sore
thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow and time doth weary time with her complaining
she looks for night and then she longs for morrow and both she thinks too long with her remaining short time seems long in sorrow s sharp sustaining
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps and they that watch see time how slow it creeps
which all this time hath overslipp d her thought that she with painted images hath spent being from the feeling of her own grief brought by deep surmise of others detriment losing her woes in shows of discontent
it easeth some though none it ever cur d to think their dolour others have endur d
but now the mindful messenger come back brings home his lord and other company who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black and round about her tear distained eye blue circles stream d like rainbows in the sky
these water galls in her dim element foretell new storms to those already spent
which when her sad beholding husband saw amazedly in her sad face he stares her eyes though sod in tears look d red and raw her lively colour kill d with deadly cares
he hath no power to ask her how she fares both stood like old acquaintance in a trance met far from home wondering each other s chance
at last he takes her by the bloodless hand and thus begins what uncouth ill event hath thee befall n that thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attir d in discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness and tell thy grief that we may give redress
three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire ere once she can discharge one word of woe at length address d to answer his desire she modestly prepares to let them know her honour is ta en prisoner by the foe while collatine and his consorted lords with sad attention long to hear her words
and now this pale swan in her watery nest begins the sad dirge of her certain ending few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best where no excuse can give the fault amending in me more woes than words are now depending and my laments would be drawn out too long to tell them all with one poor tired tongue
then be this all the task it hath to say — dear husband in the interest of thy bed a stranger came and on that pillow lay where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head and what wrong else may be imagined by foul enforcement might be done to me from that alas
for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight with shining falchion in my chamber came a creeping creature with a flaming light and softly cried awake thou roman dame and entertain my love else lasting shame on thee and thine this night i will inflict if thou my love s desire do contradict
for some hard favour d groom of thine quoth he unless thou yoke thy liking to my will i ll murder straight and then i ll slaughter thee and swear i found you where you did fulfil the loathsome act of lust and so did kill the lechers in their deed this act will be my fame and thy perpetual infamy
with this i did begin to start and cry and then against my heart he sets his sword swearing unless i took all patiently i should not live to speak another word so should my shame still rest upon record and never be forgot in mighty rome the adulterate death of lucrece and her groom
mine enemy was strong my poor self weak and far the weaker with so strong a fear my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak no rightful plea might plead for justice there his scarlet lust came evidence to swear that my poor beauty had purloin d his eyes and when the judge is robb d the prisoner dies
o teach me how to make mine own excuse
or at the least this refuge let me find though my gross blood be stain d with this abuse immaculate and spotless is my mind that was not forc d that never was inclin d to accessary yieldings but still pure doth in her poison d closet yet endure
lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss with head declin d and voice damm d up with woe with sad set eyes and wretched arms across from lips new waxen pale begins to blow the grief away that stops his answer so but wretched as he is he strives in vain what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
as through an arch the violent roaring tide outruns the eye that doth behold his haste yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride back to the strait that forc d him on so fast in rage sent out recall d in rage being past even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw
to push grief on and back the same grief draw
which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth another power no flood by raining slaketh
my woe too sensible thy passion maketh more feeling painful let it then suffice to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes
and for my sake when i might charm thee so for she that was thy lucrece —now attend me be suddenly revenged on my foe thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me comes all too late yet let the traitor die for sparing justice feeds iniquity
but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she speaking to those that came with collatine shall plight your honourable faiths to me with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine for tis a meritorious fair design to chase injustice with revengeful arms knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms
at this request with noble disposition each present lord began to promise aid as bound in knighthood to her imposition longing to hear the hateful foe bewray d
but she that yet her sad task hath not said the protestation stops
o speak quoth she how may this forced stain be wip d from me
what is the quality of mine offence being constrain d with dreadful circumstance
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense my low declined honour to advance
may any terms acquit me from this chance
the poison d fountain clears itself again and why not i from this compelled stain
with this they all at once began to say her body s stain her mind untainted clears while with a joyless smile she turns away the face that map which deep impression bears of hard misfortune carv d in it with tears
no no quoth she no dame hereafter living by my excuse shall claim excuse s giving
here with a sigh as if her heart would break she throws forth tarquin s name he he she says but more than he her poor tongue could not speak till after many accents and delays untimely breathings sick and short assays she utters this he he fair lords tis he that guides this hand to give this wound to me
even here she sheathed in her harmless breast a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheath d that blow did bail it from the deep unrest of that polluted prison where it breath d her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath d her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly life s lasting date from cancell d destiny
stone still astonish d with this deadly deed stood collatine and all his lordly crew till lucrece father that beholds her bleed himself on her self slaughter d body threw and from the purple fountain brutus drew the murderous knife and as it left the place her blood in poor revenge held it in chase and bubbling from her breast it doth divide in two slow rivers that the crimson blood circles her body in on every side who like a late sack d island vastly stood bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood
some of her blood still pure and red remain d and some look d black and that false tarquin stain d
about the mourning and congealed face of that black blood a watery rigol goes which seems to weep upon the tainted place and ever since as pitying lucrece woes corrupted blood some watery token shows and blood untainted still doth red abide blushing at that which is so putrified
daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries that life was mine which thou hast here depriv d
if in the child the father s image lies where shall i live now lucrece is unliv d
thou wast not to this end from me deriv d if children pre decease progenitors we are their offspring and they none of ours
poor broken glass i often did behold in thy sweet semblance my old age new born but now that fair fresh mirror dim and old shows me a bare bon d death by time outworn o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
and shiver d all the beauty of my glass that i no more can see what once i was
o time cease thou thy course and last no longer if they surcease to be that should survive
shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
the old bees die the young possess their hive then live sweet lucrece live again and see thy father die and not thy father thee
by this starts collatine as from a dream and bids lucretius give his sorrow place and then in key cold lucrece bleeding stream he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face and counterfeits to die with her a space till manly shame bids him possess his breath and live to be revenged on her death
the deep vexation of his inward soul hath serv d a dumb arrest upon his tongue who mad that sorrow should his use control or keep him from heart easing words so long begins to talk but through his lips do throng weak words so thick come in his poor heart s aid that no man could distinguish what he said
yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain but through his teeth as if the name he tore
this windy tempest till it blow up rain held back his sorrow s tide to make it more at last it rains and busy winds give o er then son and father weep with equal strife who should weep most for daughter or for wife
the one doth call her his the other his yet neither may possess the claim they lay the father says she s mine o mine she is replies her husband do not take away my sorrow s interest let no mourner say he weeps for her for she was only mine and only must be wail d by collatine
o quoth lucretius i did give that life which she too early and too late hath spill d
woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife i owed her and tis mine that she hath kill d
my daughter and my wife with clamours fill d the dispers d air who holding lucrece life answer d their cries my daughter
brutus who pluck d the knife from lucrece side seeing such emulation in their woe began to clothe his wit in state and pride burying in lucrece wound his folly s show
he with the romans was esteemed so as silly jeering idiots are with kings for sportive words and uttering foolish things but now he throws that shallow habit by wherein deep policy did him disguise and arm d his long hid wits advisedly to check the tears in collatinus eyes
thou wronged lord of rome quoth he arise let my unsounded self suppos d a fool now set thy long experienc d wit to school
why collatine is woe the cure for woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
is it revenge to give thyself a blow for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds thy wretched wife mistook the matter so to slay herself that should have slain her foe
courageous roman do not steep thy heart in such relenting dew of lamentations but kneel with me and help to bear thy part to rouse our roman gods with invocations that they will suffer these abominations since rome herself in them doth stand disgrac d by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chas d
now by the capitol that we adore and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain d by heaven s fair sun that breeds the fat earth s store by all our country rights in rome maintain d and by chaste lucrece soul that late complain d her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife we will revenge the death of this true wife
this said he struck his hand upon his breast and kiss d the fatal knife to end his vow and to his protestation urg d the rest who wondering at him did his words allow then jointly to the ground their knees they bow and that deep vow which brutus made before he doth again repeat and that they swore
when they had sworn to this advised doom they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence to show her bleeding body thorough rome and so to publish tarquin s foul offence which being done with speedy diligence the romans plausibly did give consent to tarquin s everlasting banishment
venus and adonis vilia miretur vulgus mihi flavus apollo pocula castalia plena ministret aqua to the right honourable henry wriothesley earl of southampton and baron of titchfield

venus and adonis even as the sun with purple colour’d face had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn rose cheek’d adonis tried him to the chase hunting he lov’d but love he laugh’d to scorn 4 sick thoughted venus makes amain unto him and like a bold fac’d suitor ’gins to woo him

12 “vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed and rein his proud head to the saddle bow if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know 16 here come and sit where never serpent hisses and being set i’ll smother thee with kisses
“and yet not cloy thy lips with loath’d satiety but rather famish them amid their plenty 20 making them red and pale with fresh variety ten kisses short as one one long as twenty a summer’s day will seem an hour but short being wasted in such time beguiling sport ” 24 with this she seizeth on his sweating palm the precedent of pith and livelihood and trembling in her passion calls it balm earth’s sovereign salve to do a goddess good 28 being so enrag’d desire doth lend her force courageously to pluck him from his horse
over one arm the lusty courser’s rein under her other was the tender boy 32 who blush’d and pouted in a dull disdain with leaden appetite unapt to toy she red and hot as coals of glowing fire he red for shame but frosty in desire
36 the studded bridle on a ragged bough nimbly she fastens —o
how quick is love — the steed is stalled up and even now to tie the rider she begins to prove 40 backward she push’d him as she would be thrust and govern’d him in strength though not in lust
so soon was she along as he was down each leaning on their elbows and their hips 44 now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown and ’gins to chide but soon she stops his lips and kissing speaks with lustful language broken “if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open ” 48 he burns with bashful shame she with her tears doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks then with her windy sighs and golden hairs to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
52 he saith she is immodest blames her miss what follows more she murders with a kiss
even as an empty eagle sharp by fast tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone 56 shaking her wings devouring all in haste till either gorge be stuff’d or prey be gone even so she kiss’d his brow his cheek his chin and where she ends she doth anew begin
60 forc’d to content but never to obey panting he lies and breatheth in her face
she feedeth on the steam as on a prey and calls it heavenly moisture air of grace 64 wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers so they were dew’d with such distilling showers
look how a bird lies tangled in a net so fasten’d in her arms adonis lies 68 pure shame and aw’d resistance made him fret which bred more beauty in his angry eyes rain added to a river that is rank perforce will force it overflow the bank
72 still she entreats and prettily entreats for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
still is he sullen still he lours and frets ’twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale 76 being red she loves him best and being white her best is better’d with a more delight
look how he can she cannot choose but love and by her fair immortal hand she swears 80 from his soft bosom never to remove till he take truce with her contending tears which long have rain’d making her cheeks all wet and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
upon this promise did he raise his chin 85 like a dive dapper peering through a wave who being look’d on ducks as quickly in so offers he to give what she did crave 88 but when her lips were ready for his pay he winks and turns his lips another way
never did passenger in summer’s heat more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
92 her help she sees but help she cannot get she bathes in water yet her fire must burn “o
pity ” ’gan she cry “flint hearted boy ’tis but a kiss i beg why art thou coy
96 “i have been woo’d as i entreat thee now even by the stern and direful god of war whose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow who conquers where he comes in every jar 100 yet hath he been my captive and my slave and begg’d for that which thou unask’d shalt have
“over my altars hath he hung his lance his batter’d shield his uncontrolled crest 104 and for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance to toy to wanton dally smile and jest scorning his churlish drum and ensign red making my arms his field his tent my bed
108 “thus he that overrul’d i oversway’d leading him prisoner in a red rose chain strong temper’d steel his stronger strength obey’d yet was he servile to my coy disdain
112 oh be not proud nor brag not of thy might for mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight
“touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine though mine be not so fair yet are they red 116 the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine what see’st thou in the ground
hold up thy head look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes
120 “art thou asham’d to kiss

love keeps his revels where there are but twain be bold to play our sport is not in sight 124 these blue vein’d violets whereon we lean never can blab nor know not what we mean
“the tender spring upon thy tempting lip 127 shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted make use of time let not advantage slip beauty within itself should not be wasted fair flowers that are not gather’d in their prime rot and consume themselves in little time
132 “were i hard favour’d foul or wrinkled old ill nurtur’d crooked churlish harsh in voice o’erworn despised rheumatic and cold thick sighted barren lean and lacking juice 136 then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee but having no defects why dost abhor me

148 love is a spirit all compact of fire not gross to sink but light and will aspire
“witness this primrose bank whereon i lie 151 these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky from morn till night even where i list to sport me
is love so light sweet boy and may it be that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee
156 “is thine own heart to thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
then woo thyself be of thyself rejected steal thine own freedom and complain on theft
160 narcissus so himself himself forsook and died to kiss his shadow in the brook
“torches are made to light jewels to wear dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 164 herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty thou wast begot to get it is thy duty
168 “upon the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed unless the earth with thy increase be fed
by law of nature thou art bound to breed that thine may live when thou thyself art dead 172 and so in spite of death thou dost survive in that thy likeness still is left alive ” by this the love sick queen began to sweat for where they lay the shadow had forsook them 176 and titan tired in the midday heat with burning eye did hotly overlook them wishing adonis had his team to guide so he were like him and by venus’ side
180 and now adonis with a lazy spright and with a heavy dark disliking eye his louring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight like misty vapours when they blot the sky 184 souring his cheeks cries “fie no more of love the sun doth burn my face i must remove ” “ay me ” quoth venus “young and so unkind
what bare excuses mak’st thou to be gone
188 i’ll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind shall cool the heat of this descending sun i’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs if they burn too i’ll quench them with my tears
192 “the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm and lo i lie between that sun and thee the heat i have from thence doth little harm thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 196 and were i not immortal life were done between this heavenly and earthly sun
“art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 200 art thou a woman’s son and canst not feel what ’tis to love how want of love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard a mind she had not brought forth thee but died unkind
204 “what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
or what great danger dwells upon my suit
what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 208 give me one kiss i’ll give it thee again and one for int’rest if thou wilt have twain
“fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone well painted idol image dull and dead 212 statue contenting but the eye alone thing like a man but of no woman bred thou art no man though of a man’s complexion for men will kiss even by their own direction ” 216 this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue and swelling passion doth provoke a pause red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong being judge in love she cannot right her cause
220 and now she weeps and now she fain would speak and now her sobs do her intendments break
sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand now gazeth she on him now on the ground 224 sometimes her arms infold him like a band she would he will not in her arms be bound and when from thence he struggles to be gone she locks her lily fingers one in one
228 “fondling ” she saith “since i have hemm’d thee here within the circuit of this ivory pale i’ll be a park and thou shalt be my deer feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 232 graze on my lips and if those hills be dry stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie
these lovely caves these round enchanting pits open’d their mouths to swallow venus’ liking
248 being mad before how doth she now for wits
struck dead at first what needs a second striking
poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn
252 now which way shall she turn
her words are done her woes the more increasing the time is spent her object will away and from her twining arms doth urge releasing 256 “pity ” she cries “some favour some remorse ” away he springs and hasteth to his horse
but lo from forth a copse that neighbours by a breeding jennet lusty young and proud 260 adonis’ tramping courser doth espy and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud the strong neck’d steed being tied unto a tree breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he
264 imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds and now his woven girths he breaks asunder the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds whose hollow womb resounds like heaven’s thunder the iron bit he crusheth ’tween his teeth 269 controlling what he was controlled with
his ears up prick’d his braided hanging mane upon his compass’d crest now stand on end 272 his nostrils drink the air and forth again as from a furnace vapours doth he send his eye which scornfully glisters like fire shows his hot courage and his high desire
276 sometime he trots as if he told the steps with gentle majesty and modest pride anon he rears upright curvets and leaps as who should say “lo thus my strength is tried and this i do to captivate the eye 281 of the fair breeder that is standing by ” what recketh he his rider’s angry stir his flattering “holla” or his “stand i say”
284 what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
for rich caparisons or trappings gay
he sees his love and nothing else he sees nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees
288 look when a painter would surpass the life in limning out a well proportion’d steed his art with nature’s workmanship at strife as if the dead the living should exceed 292 so did this horse excel a common one in shape in courage colour pace and bone
round hoof’d short jointed fetlocks shag and long broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide look what a horse should have he did not lack save a proud rider on so proud a back
300 sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares anon he starts at stirring of a feather to bid the wind a base he now prepares and where he run or fly they know not whether 304 for through his mane and tail the high wind sings fanning the hairs who wave like feather’d wings
he looks upon his love and neighs unto her she answers him as if she knew his mind 308 being proud as females are to see him woo her she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels beating his kind embracements with her heels
312 then like a melancholy malcontent he vails his tail that like a falling plume cool shadow to his melting buttock lent he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
316 his love perceiving how he was enrag’d grew kinder and his fury was assuag’d
his testy master goeth about to take him when lo the unback’d breeder full of fear 320 jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him with her the horse and left adonis there as they were mad unto the wood they hie them outstripping crows that strive to overfly them
324 all swoln with chafing down adonis sits banning his boisterous and unruly beast and now the happy season once more fits that love sick love by pleading may be blest 328 for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong when it is barr’d the aidance of the tongue
an oven that is stopp’d or river stay’d burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 332 so of concealed sorrow may be said free vent of words love’s fire doth assuage but when the heart’s attorney once is mute the client breaks as desperate in his suit
336 he sees her coming and begins to glow even as a dying coal revives with wind and with his bonnet hides his angry brow looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 340 taking no notice that she is so nigh for all askance he holds her in his eye
o what a sight it was wistly to view how she came stealing to the wayward boy 344 to note the fighting conflict of her hue how white and red each other did destroy but now her cheek was pale and by and by it flash’d forth fire as lightning from the sky
348 now was she just before him as he sat and like a lowly lover down she kneels with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 352 his tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print as apt as new fall’n snow takes any dint
oh what a war of looks was then between them her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 356 his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them her eyes woo’d still his eyes disdain’d the wooing and all this dumb play had his acts made plain with tears which chorus like her eyes did rain
full gently now she takes him by the hand 361 a lily prison’d in a gaol of snow or ivory in an alabaster band so white a friend engirts so white a foe 364 this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling show’d like two silver doves that sit a billing
once more the engine of her thoughts began “o fairest mover on this mortal round 368 would thou wert as i am and i a man my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee though nothing but my body’s bane would cure thee ” “give me my hand ” saith he “why dost thou feel it ” “give me my heart ” saith she “and thou shalt have it
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it and being steel’d soft sighs can never grave it
“how like a jade he stood tied to the tree servilely master’d with a leathern rein
392 but when he saw his love his youth’s fair fee he held such petty bondage in disdain throwing the base thong from his bending crest enfranchising his mouth his back his breast
396 “who sees his true love in her naked bed teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white but when his glutton eye so full hath fed his other agents aim at like delight
400 who is so faint that dare not be so bold to touch the fire the weather being cold
“let me excuse thy courser gentle boy and learn of him i heartily beseech thee 404 to take advantage on presented joy though i were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn to love the lesson is but plain and once made perfect never lost again ” 408 “i know not love ” quoth he “nor will not know it unless it be a boar and then i chase it ’tis much to borrow and i will not owe it my love to love is love but to disgrace it 412 for i have heard it is a life in death that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath
“who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish’d
who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
416 if springing things be any jot diminish’d they wither in their prime prove nothing worth the colt that’s back’d and burden’d being young loseth his pride and never waxeth strong
420 “you hurt my hand with wringing
let us part and leave this idle theme this bootless chat remove your siege from my unyielding heart to love’s alarms it will not ope the gate 424 dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flatt’ry for where a heart is hard they make no batt’ry ” “what
canst thou talk ” quoth she “hast thou a tongue
o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing 428 thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong i had my load before now press’d with bearing melodious discord heavenly tune harsh sounding ear’s deep sweet music and heart’s deep sore wounding
“had i no eyes but ears my ears would love 433 that inward beauty and invisible or were i deaf thy outward parts would move each part in me that were but sensible 436 though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see yet should i be in love by touching thee
“say that the sense of feeling were bereft me and that i could not see nor hear nor touch 440 and nothing but the very smell were left me yet would my love to thee be still as much for from the stillitory of thy face excelling comes breath perfum’d that breedeth love by smelling
“but oh what banquet wert thou to the taste 445 being nurse and feeder of the other four would they not wish the feast might ever last and bid suspicion double lock the door lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest should by his stealing in disturb the feast ” 448 once more the ruby colour’d portal open’d which to his speech did honey passage yield 452 like a red morn that ever yet betoken’d wrack to the seaman tempest to the field sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds
456 this ill presage advisedly she marketh even as the wind is hush’d before it raineth or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh or as the berry breaks before it staineth 460 or like the deadly bullet of a gun his meaning struck her ere his words begun
and at his look she flatly falleth down for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth 464 a smile recures the wounding of a frown but blessed bankrout that by love so thriveth
the silly boy believing she is dead claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red
468 and all amaz’d brake off his late intent for sharply he did think to reprehend her which cunning love did wittily prevent fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
472 for on the grass she lies as she were slain till his breath breatheth life in her again
he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard 476 he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr’d he kisses her and she by her good will will never rise so he will kiss her still
480 the night of sorrow now is turn’d to day her two blue windows faintly she up heaveth like the fair sun when in his fresh array he cheers the morn and all the world relieveth 484 and as the bright sun glorifies the sky so is her face illumin’d with her eye
whose beams upon his hairless face are fix’d as if from thence they borrow’d all their shine
488 were never four such lamps together mix’d had not his clouded with his brow’s repine but hers which through the crystal tears gave light shone like the moon in water seen by night
492 “o where am i ” quoth she “in earth or heaven
or in the ocean drench’d or in the fire
do i delight to die or life desire
496 but now i liv’d and life was death’s annoy but now i died and death was lively joy
“o thou didst kill me kill me once again thy eyes’ shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine 500 hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain that they have murder’d this poor heart of mine and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
504 “long may they kiss each other for this cure
oh never let their crimson liveries wear and as they last their verdure still endure to drive infection from the dangerous year 508 that the star gazers having writ on death may say the plague is banish’d by thy breath
“pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted what bargains may i make still to be sealing
512 to sell myself i can be well contented so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing which purchase if thou make for fear of slips set thy seal manual on my wax red lips
516 “a thousand kisses buys my heart from me and pay them at thy leisure one by one what is ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told and quickly gone
520 say for non payment that the debt should double is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble ” “fair queen ” quoth he “if any love you owe me measure my strangeness with my unripe years 524 before i know myself seek not to know me no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears the mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast or being early pluck’d is sour to taste
528 “look the world’s comforter with weary gait his day’s hot task hath ended in the west the owl night’s herald shrieks ’tis very late the sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest 532 and coal black clouds that shadow heaven’s light do summon us to part and bid good night
“now let me say good night and so say you if you will say so you shall have a kiss ” 536 “good night ” quoth she and ere he says adieu the honey fee of parting tender’d is her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace incorporate then they seem face grows to face
540 till breathless he disjoin’d and backward drew the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth 544 he with her plenty press’d she faint with dearth their lips together glued fall to the earth
now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey and glutton like she feeds yet never filleth 548 her lips are conquerors his lips obey paying what ransom the insulter willeth whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high that she will draw his lips’ rich treasure dry
552 and having felt the sweetness of the spoil with blindfold fury she begins to forage her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage 556 planting oblivion beating reason back forgetting shame’s pure blush and honour’s wrack
hot faint and weary with her hard embracing like a wild bird being tam’d with too much handling or as the fleet foot roe that’s tir’d with chasing 561 or like the froward infant still’d with dandling he now obeys and now no more resisteth while she takes all she can not all she listeth
564 what wax so frozen but dissolves with temp’ring and yields at last to every light impression
things out of hope are compass’d oft with vent’ring chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission 568 affection faints not like a pale fac’d coward but then woos best when most his choice is froward
when he did frown o had she then gave over such nectar from his lips she had not suck’d
572 foul words and frowns must not repel a lover what though the rose have prickles yet ’tis pluck’d
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast yet love breaks through and picks them all at last
for pity now she can no more detain him 577 the poor fool prays her that he may depart she is resolv’d no longer to restrain him bids him farewell and look well to her heart 580 the which by cupid’s bow she doth protest he carries thence encaged in his breast
“sweet boy ” she says “this night i’ll waste in sorrow for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
584 tell me love’s master shall we meet tomorrow say shall we
wilt thou make the match ” he tells her no tomorrow he intends to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
588 “the boar ” quoth she whereat a sudden pale like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
592 she sinketh down still hanging by his neck he on her belly falls she on her back
now is she in the very lists of love her champion mounted for the hot encounter 596 all is imaginary she doth prove he will not manage her although he mount her that worse than tantalus’ is her annoy to clip elysium and to lack her joy
600 even as poor birds deceiv’d with painted grapes do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw even so she languisheth in her mishaps as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
604 the warm effects which she in him finds missing she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
but all in vain good queen it will not be she hath assay’d as much as may be prov’d 608 her pleading hath deserv’d a greater fee she’s love she loves and yet she is not lov’d
“fie fie ” he says “you crush me let me go you have no reason to withhold me so ” 612 “thou hadst been gone ” quoth she “sweet boy ere this but that thou told’st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
oh be advis’d thou know’st not what it is with javelin’s point a churlish swine to gore 616 whose tushes never sheath’d he whetteth still like to a mortal butcher bent to kill
“on his bow back he hath a battle set of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes 620 his eyes like glow worms shine when he doth fret his snout digs sepulchres where’er he goes being mov’d he strikes whate’er is in his way and whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay
624 “his brawny sides with hairy bristles armed are better proof than thy spear’s point can enter his short thick neck cannot be easily harmed being ireful on the lion he will venture 628 the thorny brambles and embracing bushes as fearful of him part through whom he rushes
he naught esteems that face of thine to which love’s eyes pay tributary gazes 632 nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne whose full perfection all the world amazes but having thee at vantage wondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots the mead
“oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still 637 beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends come not within his danger by thy will they that thrive well take counsel of their friends
when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble i fear’d thy fortune and my joints did tremble
“didst thou not mark my face was it not white
saw’st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
644 grew i not faint and fell i not downright
within my bosom whereon thou dost lie my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast
“for where love reigns disturbing jealousy 649 doth call himself affection’s sentinel gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny and in a peaceful hour doth cry “kill kill ” 652 distemp’ring gentle love in his desire as air and water do abate the fire
“this sour informer this bate breeding spy this canker that eats up love’s tender spring 656 this carry tale dissentious jealousy that sometime true news sometime false doth bring knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear that if i love thee i thy death should fear
660 “and more than so presenteth to mine eye the picture of an angry chafing boar under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie an image like thyself all stain’d with gore 664 whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed doth make them droop with grief and hang the head
“what should i do seeing thee so indeed that tremble at th’imagination
668 the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed and fear doth teach it divination i prophesy thy death my living sorrow if thou encounter with the boar tomorrow
672 “but if thou needs wilt hunt be rul’d by me uncouple at the timorous flying hare or at the fox which lives by subtilty or at the roe which no encounter dare 676 pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs and on thy well breath’d horse keep with thy hounds
“and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles 680 how he outruns the wind and with what care he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles the many musits through the which he goes are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
684 “sometime he runs among a flock of sheep to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell and sometime where earth delving conies keep to stop the loud pursuers in their yell 688 and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear
“for there his smell with others being mingled 691 the hot scent snuffing hounds are driven to doubt ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled with much ado the cold fault cleanly out then do they spend their mouths echo replies as if another chase were in the skies
696 “by this poor wat far off upon a hill stands on his hinder legs with list’ning ear to hearken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear 700 and now his grief may be compared well to one sore sick that hears the passing bell
“then shalt thou see the dew bedabbled wretch turn and return indenting with the way 704 each envious briar his weary legs do scratch each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay for misery is trodden on by many and being low never reliev’d by any
708 “lie quietly and hear a little more nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise to make thee hate the hunting of the boar unlike myself thou hear’st me moralize 712 applying this to that and so to so for love can comment upon every woe
“where did i leave ” “no matter where ” quoth he “leave me and then the story aptly ends 716 the night is spent ” “why what of that ” quoth she
“i am ” quoth he “expected of my friends and now ’tis dark and going i shall fall ” “in night ” quoth she “desire sees best of all ” 720 but if thou fall oh then imagine this the earth in love with thee thy footing trips and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
723 rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips make modest dian cloudy and forlorn lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn
“now of this dark night i perceive the reason cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine 728 till forging nature be condemn’d of treason for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine wherein she fram’d thee in high heaven’s despite to shame the sun by day and her by night
732 “and therefore hath she brib’d the destinies to cross the curious workmanship of nature to mingle beauty with infirmities and pure perfection with impure defeature 736 making it subject to the tyranny of mad mischances and much misery
“as burning fevers agues pale and faint life poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood 740 the marrow eating sickness whose attaint disorder breeds by heating of the blood surfeits imposthumes grief and damn’d despair swear nature’s death for framing thee so fair
744 “and not the least of all these maladies but in one minute’s fight brings beauty under both favour savour hue and qualities whereat th’impartial gazer late did wonder 748 are on the sudden wasted thaw’d and done as mountain snow melts with the midday sun
“therefore despite of fruitless chastity love lacking vestals and self loving nuns 752 that on the earth would breed a scarcity and barren dearth of daughters and of sons be prodigal the lamp that burns by night dries up his oil to lend the world his light
756 “what is thy body but a swallowing grave seeming to bury that posterity which by the rights of time thou needs must have if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
760 if so the world will hold thee in disdain sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain
“so in thyself thyself art made away a mischief worse than civil home bred strife 764 or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay or butcher sire that reeves his son of life
foul cank’ring rust the hidden treasure frets but gold that’s put to use more gold begets ” 768 “nay then ” quoth adon “you will fall again into your idle over handled theme the kiss i gave you is bestow’d in vain and all in vain you strive against the stream 772 for by this black fac’d night desire’s foul nurse your treatise makes me like you worse and worse
“if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues and every tongue more moving than your own 776 bewitching like the wanton mermaid’s songs yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown for know my heart stands armed in mine ear and will not let a false sound enter there
780 “lest the deceiving harmony should run into the quiet closure of my breast and then my little heart were quite undone in his bedchamber to be barr’d of rest
784 no lady no my heart longs not to groan but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone
“what have you urg’d that i cannot reprove
the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger 790 i hate not love but your device in love that lends embracements unto every stranger
you do it for increase o strange excuse
when reason is the bawd to lust’s abuse
792 “call it not love for love to heaven is fled since sweating lust on earth usurp’d his name under whose simple semblance he hath fed upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame 796 which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves as caterpillars do the tender leaves
“love comforteth like sunshine after rain but lust’s effect is tempest after sun 800 love’s gentle spring doth always fresh remain lust’s winter comes ere summer half be done
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies love is all truth lust full of forged lies
804 “more i could tell but more i dare not say the text is old the orator too green
therefore in sadness now i will away my face is full of shame my heart of teen 808 mine ears that to your wanton talk attended do burn themselves for having so offended ” with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace 811 of those fair arms which bound him to her breast and homeward through the dark laund runs apace leaves love upon her back deeply distress’d
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky so glides he in the night from venus’ eye
816 which after him she darts as one on shore gazing upon a late embarked friend till the wild waves will have him seen no more whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend 820 so did the merciless and pitchy night fold in the object that did feed her sight
whereat amaz’d as one that unaware hath dropp’d a precious jewel in the flood 824 or ’stonish’d as night wanderers often are their light blown out in some mistrustful wood even so confounded in the dark she lay having lost the fair discovery of her way
828 and now she beats her heart whereat it groans that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled make verbal repetition of her moans passion on passion deeply is redoubled 832 “ay me ” she cries and twenty times “woe woe ” and twenty echoes twenty times cry so
she marking them begins a wailing note and sings extemporally a woeful ditty 836 how love makes young men thrall and old men dote how love is wise in folly foolish witty her heavy anthem still concludes in woe and still the choir of echoes answer so
840 her song was tedious and outwore the night for lovers’ hours are long though seeming short if pleas’d themselves others they think delight in such like circumstance with such like sport 844 their copious stories oftentimes begun end without audience and are never done
for who hath she to spend the night withal but idle sounds resembling parasites 848 like shrill tongu’d tapsters answering every call soothing the humour of fantastic wits
she says “’tis so ” they answer all “’tis so ” and would say after her if she said “no ” 852 lo here the gentle lark weary of rest from his moist cabinet mounts up on high and wakes the morning from whose silver breast the sun ariseth in his majesty 856 who doth the world so gloriously behold that cedar tops and hills seem burnish’d gold
venus salutes him with this fair good morrow “oh thou clear god and patron of all light 860 from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow the beauteous influence that makes him bright there lives a son that suck’d an earthly mother may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other ” this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove 865 musing the morning is so much o’erworn and yet she hears no tidings of her love she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
868 anon she hears them chant it lustily and all in haste she coasteth to the cry
and as she runs the bushes in the way some catch her by the neck some kiss her face 872 some twine about her thigh to make her stay she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake
876 by this she hears the hounds are at a bay whereat she starts like one that spies an adder wreath’d up in fatal folds just in his way the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder 880 even so the timorous yelping of the hounds appals her senses and her spirit confounds
for now she knows it is no gentle chase but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud 884 because the cry remaineth in one place where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud finding their enemy to be so curst they all strain court’sy who shall cope him first
888 this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear through which it enters to surprise her heart who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear with cold pale weakness numbs each feeling part 892 like soldiers when their captain once doth yield they basely fly and dare not stay the field
thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy till cheering up her senses sore dismay’d 896 she tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy and childish error that they are afraid bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more and with that word she spied the hunted boar
900 whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red like milk and blood being mingled both together a second fear through all her sinews spread which madly hurries her she knows not whither 904 this way she runs and now she will no further but back retires to rate the boar for murther
a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways she treads the path that she untreads again 908 her more than haste is mated with delays like the proceedings of a drunken brain full of respects yet naught at all respecting in hand with all things naught at all effecting
here kennel’d in a brake she finds a hound 913 and asks the weary caitiff for his master and there another licking of his wound ’gainst venom’d sores the only sovereign plaster
916 and here she meets another sadly scowling to whom she speaks and he replies with howling
when he hath ceas’d his ill resounding noise another flap mouth’d mourner black and grim 920 against the welkin volleys out his voice another and another answer him clapping their proud tails to the ground below shaking their scratch’d ears bleeding as they go
look how the world’s poor people are amazed 925 at apparitions signs and prodigies whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed infusing them with dreadful prophecies 928 so she at these sad sighs draws up her breath and sighing it again exclaims on death
“hard favour’d tyrant ugly meagre lean 931 hateful divorce of love ” thus chides she death “grim grinning ghost earth’s worm what dost thou mean
to stifle beauty and to steal his breath who when he liv’d his breath and beauty set gloss on the rose smell to the violet
936 “if he be dead o no it cannot be seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see but hatefully at random dost thou hit
940 thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant’s heart
“hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke and hearing him thy power had lost his power
944 the destinies will curse thee for this stroke they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck’st a flower
love’s golden arrow at him should have fled and not death’s ebon dart to strike him dead
948 “dost thou drink tears that thou provok’st such weeping
what may a heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
952 now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour since her best work is ruin’d with thy rigour ” here overcome as one full of despair she vail’d her eyelids who like sluices stopp’d 956 the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair in the sweet channel of her bosom dropp’d but through the flood gates breaks the silver rain and with his strong course opens them again
960 o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye both crystals where they view’d each other’s sorrow sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry 964 but like a stormy day now wind now rain sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again
variable passions throng her constant woe as striving who should best become her grief 968 all entertain’d each passion labours so that every present sorrow seemeth chief but none is best then join they all together like many clouds consulting for foul weather
972 by this far off she hears some huntsman holla a nurse’s song ne’er pleas’d her babe so well the dire imagination she did follow this sound of hope doth labour to expel 976 for now reviving joy bids her rejoice and flatters her it is adonis’ voice
whereat her tears began to turn their tide being prison’d in her eye like pearls in glass 980 yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground who is but drunken when she seemeth drown’d
o hard believing love how strange it seems 985 not to believe and yet too credulous thy weal and woe are both of them extremes despair and hope make thee ridiculous 988 the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly
now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought adonis lives and death is not to blame 992 it was not she that call’d him all to naught now she adds honours to his hateful name
she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings imperious supreme of all mortal things
996 “no no ” quoth she “sweet death i did but jest yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear whenas i met the boar that bloody beast which knows no pity but is still severe 1000 then gentle shadow —truth i must confess— i rail’d on thee fearing my love’s decease
“’tis not my fault the boar provok’d my tongue be wreak’d on him invisible commander 1004 ’tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong i did but act he’s author of my slander
grief hath two tongues and never woman yet could rule them both without ten women’s wit ” thus hoping that adonis is alive 1009 her rash suspect she doth extenuate and that his beauty may the better thrive with death she humbly doth insinuate 1012 tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories his victories his triumphs and his glories
“o love ” quoth she “how much a fool was i to be of such a weak and silly mind 1016 to wail his death who lives and must not die till mutual overthrow of mortal kind for he being dead with him is beauty slain and beauty dead black chaos comes again
1020 “fie fie fond love thou art as full of fear as one with treasure laden hemm’d with thieves trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves ” 1024 even at this word she hears a merry horn whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn
as falcon to the lure away she flies the grass stoops not she treads on it so light 1028 and in her haste unfortunately spies the foul boar’s conquest on her fair delight which seen her eyes as murder’d with the view like stars asham’d of day themselves withdrew
or as the snail whose tender horns being hit 1033 shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain and there all smother’d up in shade doth sit long after fearing to creep forth again 1036 so at his bloody view her eyes are fled into the deep dark cabins of her head
where they resign their office and their light to the disposing of her troubled brain 1040 who bids them still consort with ugly night and never wound the heart with looks again who like a king perplexed in his throne by their suggestion gives a deadly groan
1044 whereat each tributary subject quakes as when the wind imprison’d in the ground struggling for passage earth’s foundation shakes which with cold terror doth men’s minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise 1049 that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
and being open’d threw unwilling light upon the wide wound that the boar had trench’d in his soft flank whose wonted lily white 1053 with purple tears that his wound wept was drench’d
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed but stole his blood and seem’d with him to bleed
this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth 1057 over one shoulder doth she hang her head dumbly she passions franticly she doteth she thinks he could not die he is not dead 1060 her voice is stopp’d her joints forget to bow her eyes are mad that they have wept till now
upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three and then she reprehends her mangling eye 1065 that makes more gashes where no breach should be his face seems twain each several limb is doubled for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled
“my tongue cannot express my grief for one 1069 and yet ” quoth she “behold two adons dead
my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone mine eyes are turn’d to fire my heart to lead 1072 heavy heart’s lead melt at mine eyes’ red fire
so shall i die by drops of hot desire
“alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive that’s worth the viewing
what canst thou boast of things long since or anything ensuing
1078 the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim but true sweet beauty liv’d and died with him
“bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
1081 nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you having no fair to lose you need not fear the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
but when adonis liv’d sun and sharp air 1085 lurk’d like two thieves to rob him of his fair
“and therefore would he put his bonnet on under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep 1088 the wind would blow it off and being gone play with his locks then would adonis weep and straight in pity of his tender years they both would strive who first should dry his tears
“to see his face the lion walk’d along 1093 behind some hedge because he would not fear him to recreate himself when he hath sung the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
1096 if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey and never fright the silly lamb that day
“when he beheld his shadow in the brook the fishes spread on it their golden gills 1100 when he was by the birds such pleasure took that some would sing some other in their bills would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries he fed them with his sight they him with berries
“but this foul grim and urchin snouted boar 1105 whose downward eye still looketh for a grave ne’er saw the beauteous livery that he wore witness the entertainment that he gave
1108 if he did see his face why then i know he thought to kiss him and hath kill’d him so
“’tis true ’tis true thus was adonis slain he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear 1112 who did not whet his teeth at him again but by a kiss thought to persuade him there and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine sheath’d unaware the tusk in his soft groin
1116 “had i been tooth’d like him i must confess with kissing him i should have kill’d him first but he is dead and never did he bless my youth with his the more am i accurst ” 1120 with this she falleth in the place she stood and stains her face with his congealed blood
she looks upon his lips and they are pale she takes him by the hand and that is cold 1124 she whispers in his ears a heavy tale as if they heard the woeful words she told she lifts the coffer lids that close his eyes where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies
two glasses where herself herself beheld 1129 a thousand times and now no more reflect their virtue lost wherein they late excell’d and every beauty robb’d of his effect
1132 “wonder of time ” quoth she “this is my spite that thou being dead the day should yet be light
“since thou art dead lo here i prophesy sorrow on love hereafter shall attend 1136 it shall be waited on with jealousy find sweet beginning but unsavoury end ne’er settled equally but high or low that all love’s pleasure shall not match his woe
“it shall be fickle false and full of fraud 1141 bud and be blasted in a breathing while the bottom poison and the top o’erstraw’d with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
1144 the strongest body shall it make most weak strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak
“it shall be sparing and too full of riot teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 1148 the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures it shall be raging mad and silly mild make the young old the old become a child
1152 “it shall suspect where is no cause of fear it shall not fear where it should most mistrust it shall be merciful and too severe and most deceiving when it seems most just 1156 perverse it shall be where it shows most toward put fear to valour courage to the coward
she bows her head the new sprung flower to smell comparing it to her adonis’ breath 1172 and says within her bosom it shall dwell since he himself is reft from her by death she drops the stalk and in the breach appears green dropping sap which she compares to tears
“poor flower ” quoth she “this was thy father’s guise sweet issue of a more sweet smelling sire for every little grief to wet his eyes to grow unto himself was his desire 1180 and so ’tis thine but know it is as good to wither in my breast as in his blood
