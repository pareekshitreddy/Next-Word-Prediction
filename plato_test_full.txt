on the 552a same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one
there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable
sidenote the ruined man who has no occupation once a spendthrift now a pauper still exists in the state
a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature
552b yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state
the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty
but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship
or 258 did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift
552c as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift
may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive
and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers 552d of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed
sidenote where there are paupers there are thieves clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighbourhood there are hidden away thieves and cut purses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors
well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers
yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler
552e and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force
certainly we may be so bold
the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education ill training and an evil constitution of the state
such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils
553a then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed
let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state
does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise
sidenote the ruin of the timocratical man gives birth to the oligarchical
a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden 553b foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him
sidenote his son begins life a ruined man and takes to money making
and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and 553c passion headforemost from his bosom s throne humbled by poverty he takes to money making and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together
is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar
553d and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it
of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one
553e and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth
sidenote the oligarchical man and state resemble one another in their estimation of wealth in their toiling and saving ways in their want of cultivation
yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came
let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them
first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth
also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable
he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of 554b man whom the vulgar applaud
is he not a true image of the state which he represents
he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state
you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said
i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 8
footnote 8 reading greek kai e ti ma ma lista
eu ê d e gô according to schneider s excellent emendation
yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be 554c found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life
do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries
sidenote the oligarchical man keeps up a fair outside but he has only an enforced virtue and will cheat when he can
you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan
it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad 554d passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions
yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own
261 yes and they will be strong in him too
the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires 554e will be found to prevail over his inferior ones
for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him
sidenote his meanness in a contest he saves his money and loses the prize
555a and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money
can we any longer doubt then that the miser and money maker 555b answers to the oligarchical state
sidenote democracy arises out of the extravagance and indebtedness of men of family and position next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgment
that he said is our method
well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise
is it not on this wise the good at which such a state aims is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable
555c the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance
there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will 555d be disregarded
and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary
sidenote who remain in the city and form a dangerous class ready to head a revolution
and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are 555e eager for revolution
on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state
556a yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain
sidenote two remedies 1 restrictions on the free use of property the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a man s use of his own property or by another remedy what other
sidenote 2 contracts to be made at a man s own risk
one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let 556b there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous money making and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state
yes they will be greatly lessened
at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness 556c both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain
they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue
sidenote the subjects discover the weakness of their rulers
such is the state of affairs which prevails among them
and when they meet in private will not people be 556e saying to one another our warriors are not good for much
yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking
sidenote a slight cause internal or external may produce revolution
and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise within in the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasion may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and 557a may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause
sidenote such is the origin and nature of democracy
and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot
yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw
and now what is their manner of life and what sort of 557b a government have they
for as the government is such will be the man
264 sidenote democracy allows a man to do as he likes and therefore contains the greatest variety of characters and constitutions
in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes
and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases
557c then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures
this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being like an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower 9
and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states
footnote 9 omitting greek ti mê n e phê
557d yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government
because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state
557e he will be sure to have patterns enough
sidenote the law falls into abeyance
and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not 558a this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful
265 and is not their humanity to the condemned 10 in some cases quite charming
have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares
footnote 10 or the philosophical temper of the condemned
yes he replied many and many a one
sidenote all principles of order and good taste are trampled under foot by democracy
yes she is of a noble spirit
these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike
consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being
is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical 558d father who has trained him in his own habits
sidenote which are the necessary and which the unnecessary pleasures
and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary
would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures
266 sidenote necessary desires cannot be got rid of are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get 558e rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us
and they are rightly called so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it
559a we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary
and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary
suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them
will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and 559b strength be of the necessary class
that is what i should suppose
the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life
sidenote but may be indulged to excess
but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health
sidenote illustration taken from eating and drinking
and the desire which goes beyond this of more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be 559c rightly called unnecessary
may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production
and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good
and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave 267 559d of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical
again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process
sidenote the young oligarch is led away by his wild associates
when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may 559e imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical
sidenote there are allies to either part of his nature
and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is akin and alike again helping that which is akin and alike
and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred 560a advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself
and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young man s soul and order is restored
yes he said that sometimes happens
and then again after the old desires have been driven out 560b fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous
yes he said that is apt to be the way
they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him
at length they seize upon the citadel of the young man s soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels
false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place
they are certain to do so
sidenote the progress of the oligarchic young man told in an allegory
and so the young man returns into the country of the lotus eaters and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the king s fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter nor if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them
560d there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border
and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of 560e him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling 561a them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage
and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures
yes he said the change in him is visible enough
sidenote he becomes a rake but he also sometimes stops short in his career and gives way to pleasures good and bad indifferently
sidenote he rejects all advice neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some 561c pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another
yes he said that is the way with him
sidenote passing his life in the alternation from one extreme to another
his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on
561e yes he replied he is all liberty and equality
sidenote he is not one but all mankind s epitome
yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled
and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him
561a let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man
270 let that be his place he said
last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider
say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident
and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the 562b same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort
sidenote the insatiable desire of wealth creates a demand for democracy the insatiable desire of freedom creates a demand for tyranny
the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right
and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money getting was also the ruin of oligarchy
and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution
freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy 562c is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell
yes the saying is in every body s mouth
i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny
when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil 562d cup bearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs
yes he replied a very common occurrence
sidenote freedom in the end means anarchy
yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are 271 like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public
now in 562e such a state can liberty have any limit
by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them
i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the 563a stranger is quite as good as either
yes he said that is the way
sidenote the inversion of all social relations
and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be 563b thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young
the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other
563c why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips
272 when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe
you and i have dreamed the same thing
and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have 563e no one over them
yes he said i know it too well
such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny
but what is the next step
the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive 564a increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government
the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery
and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty
sidenote the common evil of oligarchy and democracy is the class of idle spend thrifts
that however was not as i believe your question you rather desired to know what is that disorder which is 564b generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both
well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings
these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body
564c and the good physician and lawgiver of the state 273 ought like the wise bee master to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible
yes by all means he said
sidenote altogether three classes in a democracy
then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into 564d three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state
and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified
sidenote 1 the drones or spend thrifts who are more numerous and active than in the oligarchy
because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do 564e not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones
then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass
sidenote 2 the orderly or wealthy class who are fed upon by the drones
they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders is sure to be the richest
they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones
why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little
and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them
565a that is pretty much the case he said
sidenote 3 the working class who also get a share
the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon
this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy
true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey
274 and do they not share
do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves
565b why yes he said to that extent the people do share
sidenote the well to do have to defend themselves against the people
and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can
and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy
and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are 565c deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them
then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another
sidenote the people have a protector who when once he tastes blood is converted into a tyrant
the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness
565d this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector
how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant
clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus
the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is 565e destined to become a wolf
and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them 275 making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what 566a will be his destiny
must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant
this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich
sidenote after a time he is driven out but comes back a full blown tyrant
after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown
566b and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him
yes he said that is their usual way
then comes the famous request for a body guard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the people s friend as they say be lost to them
the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves
and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward 11
and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again
but if he is caught he dies
sidenote the protector standing up in the chariot of state
566d and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute
and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated
yes he said let us consider that
at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called 566e a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private
liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one
sidenote he stirs up wars and impoverishes his subjects by the imposition of taxes
but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader
567a has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him
and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war
567b now he begins to grow unpopular
then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done
sidenote he gets rid of his bravest and boldest followers
and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything
and therefore he must look about him and see who is 567c valiant who is high minded who is wise who is wealthy 277 happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state
yes he said and a rare purgation
sidenote his purgation of the state
yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse
if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself
567d what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all
and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require
and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them
they will flock to him he said of their own accord if he pays them
i said here are more drones of every sort 567e and from every land
but will he not desire to get them on the spot
he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his body guard
to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all
sidenote he puts to death his friends and lives with the slaves whom he has enfranchised
what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he 568a has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends
yes he said they are quite of his sort
yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him
sidenote euripides and the tragedians praise tyranny which is an excellent reason for expelling them from our state
verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian
278 why because he is the author of the pregnant saying 568b tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions
yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets
and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny
568c yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us
but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies
moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend 568d our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further
but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and ever changing army of his
sidenote the tyrant seizes the treasures in the temples and when these fail feeds upon the people
if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people
why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his father s estate
you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions
yes he said they cannot help themselves
sidenote they rebel and then he beats his own parent i e
but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a 279 grown up son ought not to be supported by his father but 569a that the father should be supported by the son
the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed
and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates
by heaven he said then the parent will discover what 569b a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong
why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence
beat his father if he opposes him
yes he will having first disarmed him
then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen 569c into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves
thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery
very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny
571a last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical
and how does he live in happiness or in misery
yes he said he is the only one remaining
there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered
sidenote a digression having a purpose
i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished 571b the enquiry will always be confused
well he said it is not too late to supply the omission
sidenote the wild beast latent in man peers forth in sleep
very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over them either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and 571c there are more of them
i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there 571d is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit
sidenote the contrast of the temperate man whose passions are under the control of reason
in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless wild beast nature which peers out in sleep
pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me
and now remember the character which we attributed 572c to the democratic man
he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament
and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his father s meanness
at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted 572d midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures
after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch
yes he said that was our view of him and is so still
and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his father s principles
282 then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is 572e drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones
as soon as these dire magicians and 573a tyrant makers find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him
yes he said that is the only adequate image of him
footnote 1 or opinions or appetites such as are deemed to be good
sidenote the tyrannical man is made up of lusts and appetites
love drink madness are but different forms of tyranny
yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated
and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant
further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of 573c a tyrant
and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods
and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate
o my friend is not that so
such is the man and such is his origin
and next how does he live
573d suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me
i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul
yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many
his revenues if he has any are soon spent
573e then comes debt and the cutting down of his property
sidenote his desires become greater and his means less
when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and 574a he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them
yes that is sure to be the case
he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs
sidenote he will rob his father and mother
and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs
574b and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them
and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them
and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend
will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them
284 nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents
sidenote he will prefer the love of a girl or a youth to his aged parents and may even be induced to strike them
adeimantus on account of some new fangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary 574c connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable
yes indeed he said i believe that he would
truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother
sidenote he turns highwayman robs temples loses all his early principles and becomes in waking reality the evil dream which he had in sleep
sidenote he gathers followers about him
574d he first takes their property and when that fails and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple
meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the body guard of love and share his empire
these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws 574e and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep
but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act
575a love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself
have we not here a picture of his way of life
and if there are only a few of them in the state and the 285 575b rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the body guard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city
for example they are the thieves burglars cut purses foot pads robbers of temples man stealers of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes
575c a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number
sidenote a private person can do but little harm in comparison of the tyrant
yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul 575d and him they create their tyrant
yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant
if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters
this is the end of his passions and desires
sidenote the behaviour of the tyrant to his early supporters
when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of 576a affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more
sidenote he is always either master or servant always treacherous unjust the waking reality of our dream a tyrant by nature a tyrant in fact
they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship
and may we not rightly call such men treacherous
576b also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice
yes he said and we were perfectly right
let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed
and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes
that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer
sidenote the wicked are also the most miserable
and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest 576c be also the most miserable
and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general
and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others
and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man
sidenote the opposite of the king
then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue
they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst
there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery
and here we must not allow ourselves to be panic stricken at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we 576e ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion
a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest
287 and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make 577a a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature
he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight
may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known 577b him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men
that again he said is a very fair proposal
shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person
we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries
577c let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions
sidenote the state is not free but enslaved
beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved
no city he said can be more completely enslaved
and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state
yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved
sidenote like a slave the tyrant is full of meanness and the ruling part of him is madness
577d then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest
and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave
he has the soul of a slave in my opinion
288 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily
sidenote the city which is subject to him is goaded by a gadfly 577e and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse
and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor
sidenote poor 578a and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable
and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear
is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain
and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires
578b reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states
and i was right he said
sidenote also the tyrannical man is most miserable
and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him
i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men
sidenote yet there is a still more miserable being the tyrannical man who is a public tyrant
there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong
i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery
one of whom i am about to speak
578c he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant
from what has been said i gather that you are right
289 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest
let me then offer you an illustration which may i think 578d throw a light upon this subject
sidenote in cities there are many great slaveowners and they help to protect one another
the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the tyrant s condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves
you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants
but do you observe the reason of this
yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual
sidenote but suppose a slaveowner and his slaves carried off into the wilderness what will happen then
such is the condition of the tyrant
but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves
yes he said he will be in the utmost fear
579a the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants
yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself
and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life
579b his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies
sidenote he is the daintiest of all men and has to endure the hardships of a prison and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts
his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never 290 allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman 579c hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest
sidenote miserable in himself he is still more miserable if he be in a public station
and amid evils such as these will not he who is ill governed in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant
he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his 579d life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men
yes he said the similitude is most exact
sidenote he then leads a life worse than the worst is not his case utterly miserable
and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst
sidenote in unhappiness he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation 579e and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind
he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds
580a moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself
no man of any sense will dispute your words
sidenote the umpire decides that come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical 580b contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second 291 and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical
the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery
sidenote the best is the happiest and the worst is the most miserable
this is the proclamation of the son of ariston
need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest 580c is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state
make the proclamation yourself he said
and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men
then this i said will be our first proof and there is 580d another which may also have some weight
sidenote proof derived from the three principles of the soul
the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration
it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers
there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third 580e having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it 581a also money loving because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money
sidenote 1 the appetitive if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be 292 able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money
again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame
sidenote 2 the ambitious suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable
sidenote 3 the principle of knowledge and truth
on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame
lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul
one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men 581c another in others as may happen
then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain
and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects
sidenote each will depreciate the others but only the philosopher has the power to judge now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others 581d the money maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver
and the lover of honour what will be his opinion
will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him
293 sidenote because he alone has experience of the highest pleasures and is also acquainted with the lower
and are we to suppose 2 i said that the philosopher sets 581e any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure
does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them
footnote 2 reading with grasere and hermann greek ti oi ô metha and omitting greek ou de n which is not found in the best mss
there can be no doubt of that he replied
since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or 582a less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly
i cannot myself tell he said
well but what ought to be the criterion
is any better than experience and wisdom and reason
there cannot be a better he said
of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated
has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of 582b knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain
the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth
then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience
again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom
nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found 294 in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only
582d his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one
sidenote the philosopher alone having both judgment and experience and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience
further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher
reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest
and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument
if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or 582e blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy
or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgment of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest
sidenote the pleasures which he approves are the true pleasures he places 1 the love of wisdom 2 the love of honour 3 and lowest the love of gain
but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest
and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the 583a intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life
unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life
and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next
clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the money maker
last comes the lover of gain
sidenote true pleasure is not relative but absolute
583b twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls
yes the greatest but will you explain yourself
583c i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions
say then is not pleasure opposed to pain
and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain
a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean
you remember what people say when they are sick
that after all nothing is pleasanter than health
but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until 583d they were ill
sidenote the states intermediate between pleasure and pain are termed pleasures or pains only in relation to their opposites
and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain
and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure
yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest
583e again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful
then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain
296 but can that which is neither become both
and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not
sidenote pleasure and pain are said to be states of rest but they are really motions
584a but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them
how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain
this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is to say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition
sidenote all pleasures are not merely cessations of pains or pains of pleasures e g
the pleasures of smell are not
584b look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure
what are they he said and where shall i find them
there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them
584c let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure
still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain
and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature
584d shall i give you an illustration of them
297 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region
sidenote illustrations of the unreality of certain pleasures
and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world
to be sure he said how can he think otherwise
584e but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending
all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions
no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite
look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like 585b are inanitions of the bodily state
and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul
and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either
sidenote the intellectual more real than the sensual
and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer
clearly from that which has more
what classes of things have a greater share of pure 298 existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and 585c mind and all the different kinds of virtue
put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal
far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable
and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence
yes of knowledge in the same degree
and of truth in the same degree
and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence
585d then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul
and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul
what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real
sidenote the pleasures of the sensual and also of the passionate element are unreal and mixed
and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with 585e more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure
586a those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at 299 random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure
like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the dining table they fatten and feed 586b and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust
for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent
verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle
their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise
for they are mere shadows and pictures of 586c the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth
something of that sort must inevitably happen
and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul
will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain 586d honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense
yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also
sidenote both kinds of pleasures are attained in the highest degree when the desires which seek them are under the guidance of reason
then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth 586e and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him
yes certainly the best is the most natural
300 and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just 587a and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable
but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own
and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure
and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order
and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the 587b greatest distance
and the royal and orderly desires are nearest
then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least
but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly
sidenote the measure of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant would you know the measure of the interval which separates them
there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two 587c spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure
i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle
and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch
and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count 587d as one royal and aristocratical
then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three
sidenote expressed under the symbol of a cube corresponding to the number 729
the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure
and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king
yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum
or if some person begins at the other end and measures 587e the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is completed living 729 times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval
and how enormous is the 588a distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain
sidenote which is nearly the number of days and nights in a year
yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years 3
footnote 3 729 nearly equals the number of days and nights in the year
yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them
then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue
588b well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just
302 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him
what shall we say to him
let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes
sidenote the triple animal who has outwardly the image of a man
an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one
there are said of have been such unions
then do you now model the form of a multitudinous many headed monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will
588d you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose
suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second
that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say
and now join them and let the three grow into one
next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees 588e only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature
i have done so he said
sidenote will any one say that we should strengthen the monster and the lion at the expense of the man
303 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says
to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the 589b entire human creature
he should watch over the many headed monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the lion heart his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself
yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say
and so from every point of view whether of pleasure 589c honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant
yes from every point of view
sidenote for the noble principle subjects the beast to the man the ignoble the man to the beast
come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error
sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble
589d is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast
he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now
not if he has any regard for my opinion
sidenote a man would not be the gainer if he sold his child how much worse to sell his soul
but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst
who can imagine that a man who 589e sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received
and will any one say that he is not a miserable 590a caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable
eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her husband s life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin
yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him
has not the intemperate been censured of old because in 304 him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large
sidenote proofs 1 men are blamed for the predominance of the lower nature and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the 590b lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength
and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him
and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey
sidenote as well as for the meanness of their employments and character and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach
only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them
such appears to be the reason
sidenote 3 the care taken of children shows that we seek to establish in them a higher principle
590e and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by 591a cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways
yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest
305 from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness
from no point of view at all
sidenote the wise man will employ his energies in freeing and harmonizing the nobler elements of his nature and in regulating his bodily habits
what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished
591b he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body
591c to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life
and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others
sidenote his first aim not health but harmony of soul
in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may 591d be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul
certainly he will if he has true music in him
and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm
sidenote he will not heap up riches 591e he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means
sidenote and he will only accept such political honours as will not deteriorate his character
and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy 306 592a such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid
then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman
by the dog of egypt he will
in the city which is his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call
sidenote he has a city of his own and the ideal pattern of this will be the law of his life
i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only 592b for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth
in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order 4
but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other
footnote 4 or take up his abode there
595a of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry
to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that 595b the parts of the soul have been distinguished
sidenote poetical imitations are ruinous to the mind of the hearer
speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them
explain the purport of your remark
well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great 595c captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out
listen to me then or rather answer me
can you tell me what imitation is
for i really do not know
a likely thing then that i should know
for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener
very true he said but in your presence even if i had any 308 faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it
well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me
sidenote the idea is one but the objects comprehended under it are many
let us take any common instance there are beds and 596b tables in the world plenty of them are there not
but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table
and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he
and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him
sidenote the universal creator an extraordinary person
but note also that everybody is a creator in a sense
for all things may be made by the reflection of them in a mirror
one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen
wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so
for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also
596d he must be a wizard and no mistake
do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not
do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself
an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you 596e would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and 309 all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror
yes he said but they would be appearances only
sidenote but this is an appearance only and the painter too is a maker of appearances
very good i said you are coming to the point now
and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not
but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue
and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed
yes he said but not a real bed
597a and what of the maker of the bed
were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed
then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth
at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth
no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth
suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is
sidenote three beds and three makers of beds
well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker
there is another which is the work of the carpenter
and the work of the painter is a third
beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter
yes there are three of them
310 597c god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god
god could only make one bed if he made two a third would still appear behind them
because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and not the two others
597d god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only
shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed
yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things
and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed
but would you call the painter a creator and maker
yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed
sidenote 3 the imitator i e
the painter or poet 597e i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make
good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator
and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth
then about the imitator we are agreed
and what about 598a the painter
i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists
as they are or as they appear
you have still to determine this
sidenote whose art is one of imitation or appearance and a long way removed from the truth
i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality
and the same of all things
yes he said the difference is only apparent
598b now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality
sidenote any one who does all things does only a very small part of them
then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image
for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he 598c knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter
sidenote any one who pretends to know all things is ignorant of the very nature of knowledge
and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy 598d than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought all knowing because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation
sidenote and he who attributes such universal knowledge to the poets is similarly deceived
and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all 598e things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion
perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that 599a these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth 312 because they are appearances only and not realities
or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well
the question he said should by all means be considered
sidenote he who could make the original would not make the image
now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the image making branch
would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had 599b nothing higher in him
the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them
yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit
friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help
the good 599e order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good
italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you
is there any city which he might name
i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator
313 600a well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive
or is there any invention 1 of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him
there is absolutely nothing of the kind
but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any
had he in his lifetime friends 600b who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him
nothing of the kind is recorded of him
for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was 600c greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive
sidenote or had done anything else for the improvement of mankind he would not have been allowed to starve
yes i replied that is the tradition
but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them
protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries 600d you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders
and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous
would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay 314 600e at home with them
or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough
yes socrates that i think is quite true
sidenote the poets like the painters are but imitators then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images 601a of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach
the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures
in like manner the poet with his words and phrases 2 may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony 601b and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have
and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose
footnote 2 or with his nouns and verbs
they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them
sidenote they know nothing of true existence
here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only
then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation
of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit
315 and the worker in leather and brass will make them
sidenote the maker has more knowledge than the imitator but less than the user
but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins
nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form
and may we not say the same of all things
601d that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them
sidenote goodness of things relative to use hence the maker of them is instructed by the user
and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them
then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the flute player will tell the flute maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought 601e to make them and the other will attend to his instructions
the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him
sidenote the maker has belief and not knowledge the imitator neither
the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him 602a and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge
but will the imitator have either
will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful
or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw
then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations
the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations
602b and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude
thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates
imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree
sidenote imitation has been proved to be thrice removed from the truth
602c and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth
and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed
i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance
and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable
thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us 602d and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic
sidenote the art of measuring given to man that he may correct the variety of appearances
and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding there 317 is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight
602e and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul
and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction
but were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing
603a then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure
and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation
and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul
this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of 603b a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim
sidenote the productions of the imitative arts are bastard and illegitimate
the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring
and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry
probably the same would be true of poetry
do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see 318 603c whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad
we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly
sidenote they imitate opposites but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity 603d with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life
though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment
and we were right he said
yes i said thus far we were right but there was an 603e omission which must now be supplied
were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another
sidenote they encourage weakness but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow
the latter he said is the truer statement
604a tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone
it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not
when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do
there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is 604b forcing him to indulge his sorrow
but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him
one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law
sidenote they are at variance with the exhortations of philosophy the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human 604c thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required
that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith 604d to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art
yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune
yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason
sidenote they recall trouble and sorrow and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly
604e and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation
whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre
for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers
then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not 320 by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated
sidenote they minister in an inferior manner to an inferior principle in the soul
and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this 605b i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well ordered state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason
as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the 605c irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another small he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 3
footnote 3 reading greek ei dôlopoiou nta
but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing
yes certainly if the effect is what you say
sidenote how can we be right in sympathizing with the sorrows of poetry when we would fain restrain those of real life
hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in 605d which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most
but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part 605e and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman
321 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person
no he said that is certainly not reasonable
606a nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view
sidenote we fail to observe that a sentimental pity soon creates a real weakness
few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves
and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own
sidenote in like manner the love of comedy may turn a man into a buffoon
and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous
606d and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them 322 poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue
sidenote we are lovers of homer but we must expel him from our state
for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state
that is most true he said
607b and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us
but that she may not impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in 607c the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them
notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a well ordered state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth
323 i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her 607d as i am especially when she appears in homer
yes indeed i am greatly charmed
shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre
and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved 607e we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight
certainly he said we shall be the gainers
sidenote poetry is attractive but not true
if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle
we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education 608a of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many
at all events we are well aware 4 that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the 608b city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law
footnote 4 or if we accept madvig s ingenious but unnecessary emendation greek a so metha at all events we will sing that c yes he said i quite agree with you
yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad
and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue
324 yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been
608c and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue
what are there any greater still
if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness
sidenote the rewards of virtue extend not only to this little space of human life but to the whole of existence
why i said what was ever great in a short time
the whole period of three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity
and should an immortal being seriously think of this little 608d space rather than of the whole
are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable
he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this
yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it
i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light
there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil
608e would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good
sidenote everything has a good and an evil and if not destroyed by its own evil will not be destroyed by that of another
and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil 609a as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease
and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies
the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction 325 of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will 609b for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil
if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction
well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul
yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now 609c passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance
sidenote therefore if the soul cannot be destroyed by moral evil she certainly will not be destroyed by physical evil
but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul
take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation 609d through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them
consider the soul in like manner
does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her
do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body
and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own
609e consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body 610a has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which 326 is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny
sidenote evil means the contagion of evil and the evil of the body does not infect the soul
and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another
yes he said there is reason in that
either then let us refute this conclusion or while it 610b remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed 610c by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man
and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death
nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil
but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth 610e and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her dwelling place from being a house of death
true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction
327 yes that can hardly be
but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether 611a inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal
sidenote if the soul is indestructible the number of souls can never increase or diminish
that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number
neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality
611b but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity
the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements
sidenote the soul if she is to be seen truly should be stripped of the accidents of earth
her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she 611c really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly
thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared 611d to that of the sea god glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form
and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills
but not there glaucon not there must we look
sidenote her true conversation is with the eternal
611e at her love of wisdom
of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough
sidenote having put aside for argument s sake the rewards of virtue we may now claim to have them restored
and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument 5 612b we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature
let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades
footnote 5 reading greek a pelusa metha
and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which 612c justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death
will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument
the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be 612d weighed against pure injustice
i should be much to blame if i had forgotten
then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and 329 men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us 6 since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own
footnote 6 reading greek ê mô n
612e the demand he said is just
in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods
sidenote the just man is the friend of the gods and all things work together for his good
and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning
613a and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins
then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as 613b man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue
yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him
sidenote the unjust is the opposite
and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed
such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just
sidenote he may be compared to a runner who is only good at the start
and what do they receive of men
look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the starting place to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace 613c but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the 330 prize and is crowned
and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow
sidenote sidenote recapitulation of things unfit for ears polite which had been described by glaucon in book ii
and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust
613d i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these
and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and 613e then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying
and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors
but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true
certainly he said what you say is true
614a these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides
yes he said and they are fair and lasting
and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death
and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them
614b speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear
sidenote the two openings in heaven and the two in earth through which passed those who were beginning and those who had completed their pilgrimage
sidenote the meeting in the meadow
sidenote the punishment tenfold the sin
well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth
he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and 331 carried away home to be buried
and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world
he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company 614c and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above
in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs
he drew near 614d and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place
then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright
and 614e arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath
and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing 615a at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty
the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length 615b of man s life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years
if for example there were any who had been 332 the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and 615c holiness were in the same proportion
i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born
of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers 7 there were retributions other and greater far which he described
he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great
now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother 615d and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes
the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come
and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed
and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy
these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great

sidenote the whorls representing the spheres of the heavenly bodies
from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn
the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials
616d now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their 616e lower side all together form one continuous whorl
this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth
the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second
the largest or fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon 617a coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second
now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the 617b seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this 334 reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth
the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note
sidenote the proclamation of the free choice
sidenote the complexity of circumstances sidenote and their relation to the human soul
when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity
mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality
your genius will not be allotted to you 617e but you will choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny
virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified
when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained
618a then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts
there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition
and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the tyrant s life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were 335 lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games 618b or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities
and of women likewise there was not however any definite character in them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different
but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also
and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken
618c let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity
for we have seen and know that this is 619a the best choice both in life and after death
a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but 336 in all 619b that which is to come
for this is the way of happiness
sidenote habit not enough without philosophy when circumstances change
sidenote the spectacle of the election
and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence
let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair
and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he 619c was fated among other evils to devour his own children
but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself
now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a well ordered state but his virtue 619d was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy
and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose
and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good
for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy 619e and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly
most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls 620a was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life
there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had 337 been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men
the 620b soul which obtained the twentieth 9 lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the arms
the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings
about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her 620c there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey
there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all
now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else 620d and when he saw it he said that he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it
and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations

621b now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting
he himself was hindered from drinking the water
but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre
and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished 621c and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled
wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil
thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like 621d conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward
and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

art according to the conception of plato is not a collection of canons of criticism but a subtle influence which pervades all things animate as well as inanimate 3
he knows nothing of schools or of the history of art nor does he select any building or statue for condemnation or admiration cp protag
311 c where pheidias is casually mentioned as the typical sculptor and meno 91 d where socrates says that pheidias although he wrought such exceedingly noble works did not make nearly so much money by them as protagoras did by his wisdom plato judges art by one test simplicity but under this he includes moderation purity and harmony of proportion and he would extend to sculpture and architecture the same rigid censorship which he has already applied to poetry and music 3
he dislikes the illusions of painting 10
602 and the false proportions given by sculptors to their subjects soph
234 e both of which he classes as a species of magic
with more justice he points out the danger of an excessive devotion to art cp
the ludicrous pictures of the unmanly musician 3

the communism of the republic seems to have been suggested by plato s desire for the unity of the state cp
if those two small pestilent words meum and tuum which have engendered so much strife among men and created so much mischief in the world could be banished from the lips and thoughts of mankind the ideal state would soon be realized
the citizens would have parents wives children and property in common they would rejoice in each other s prosperity and sorrow at each other s misfortune they would call their rulers not lords and masters but friends and saviours
plato is aware that such a conception could hardly be carried out in this world and he evades or adjourns rather than solves the difficulty by the famous assertion that only when the philosopher rules in the city will the ills of human life find an end cp introduction p clxxiii
in the critias where the ideal state as plato himself hints to us 110 d is to some extent reproduced in an imaginary description of ancient attica property is common but there is no mention of a community of wives and children

the theology of plato is summed up by himself in the second book of the republic under two heads god is perfect and unchangeable and god is true and 351 the author of truth
these canons are also the test by which he tries poetry and the poets see s v poetry homer and the tragedians represent the gods as changing their forms or as deceiving men by lying dreams and therefore they must be expelled from the state
but plato has not yet acquired the austere temper of his later years
he does not threaten the impenitent unbeliever with bonds and death laws 10
908 910 but is content to show by argument the superiority of justice over injustice
in other respects the theology of the republic is repeated and amplified in the laws the theses that god is not the author of evil and will not accept the gifts of the wicked or favour the unjust are maintained with equal earnestness in both
the republic is less pessimistic in tone than the laws but the thought of the insignificance of man and the briefness of human life is already familiar to plato s mind cp 6

both in the republic 352 and the statesman the series commences with the perfect state which may be either monarchy or aristocracy accordingly as the one best man bears rule or many who are all perfect in virtue cp arist
but in the republic the further succession is somewhat fancifully connected with the divisions of the soul
the rule of reason i e
the perfect state passes into timocracy in which the spirited element is predominant 8
548 timocracy into three governments in turn which represent the appetitive principle first oligarchy in which the desire of wealth is supreme 8
581 secondly democracy characterised by an unbounded lust for freedom 9
561 thirdly tyranny in which all evil desires grow unchecked and the tyrant becomes the waking reality of what he once was in his dreams only 9
each of these inferior forms is illustrated in the individual who corresponds to the state and is set over against it 8
in the statesman after the government of the one or many good has been separated the remaining forms are classified accordingly as the government has or has not regard to law and democracy is said to be 303 a the worst of lawful and the best of lawless governments an expression criticised by aristotle pol
in the laws again the subject is differently treated monarchy and democracy are described as the two mother forms which must be combined in order to produce a good state 3
693 and the spartan and cretan constitutions are therefore praised as polities in which every form of government is represented 4
but the majority of existing states are mere class governments and have no regard to virtue 12
these various ideas are nearly all reproduced or criticised in the politics of aristotle who however does not employ the term timocracy and adds one great original conception the greek mesê politei a or government of the middle class governments sometimes bought and sold 8

596 singleness of ib 597 cp tim
the idea of good is an abstraction which under that name at least does not elsewhere occur in plato s writings
but it is probably not essentially different from another abstraction the true being of things which is mentioned in many of his dialogues cp
he has nowhere given an explanation of his meaning not because he was regardless whether we understood him or not but rather perhaps because he was himself unable to state in precise terms the ideal which floated before his mind
he belonged to an age in which men felt too strongly the first pleasure of metaphysical speculation to be able to estimate the true value of the ideas which they conceived cp
his own picture of the effect of dialectic on the youthful mind 7
to him as to the schoolmen of the middle ages an abstraction seemed truer than a fact he was impatient to shake off the shackles of sense and rise into the purer atmosphere of ideas
yet in the allegory of the cave book vii whose inhabitants must go up to the light of perfect knowledge but descend again into the obscurity of opinion he has shown that he was not unaware of the necessity of finding a firm starting point for these flights of metaphysical imagination cp 6
a passage in the philebus 65 a gives perhaps the best insight into his meaning if we are not able to hunt the good with one idea only with three we may take our prey beauty symmetry truth
the three were inseparable to the greek mind and no conception of perfection could be formed in which they did not unite cp

431 the same in the individual and the state 4
the search for justice is the groundwork or foundation of the republic which commences with an enquiry into its nature and ends with a triumphant demonstration of the superior happiness enjoyed by the just man
in the first book several definitions of justice are attempted all of which prove inadequate
glaucon and adeimantus then intervene mankind regard justice as a necessity not as a good in itself or at best as only to be practised because of the temporal benefits which flow from it can socrates prove that it belongs to a higher class of goods
socrates in reply proposes to construct an ideal state in which justice will be more easily recognised than in the individual
justice is thus discovered to be the essential virtue of the state a thesis afterwards enlarged upon by aristotle pol
13 § 3 the bond of the social organization and like temperance in the laws 3
709 e rather the accompaniment or condition of the virtues than a virtue in itself cp introduction p lxiii
expressed in an outward or political form it becomes the great principle which has been already enunciated i
322 that every man shall do his own work on this plato bases the necessity of the division into classes which underlies the whole fabric of the ideal state 4
thus we are led to acknowledge the happiness of the just for he alone reflects in himself this vital principle of the state 4
the final proof is supplied by a comparison of the perfect state with actual forms of government
these like the individuals who correspond to them become more and more miserable as they recede further from the ideal and the climax is reached 9

music to the ancients had a far wider significance than to us
it was opposed to gymnastic as mental to bodily training and included equally reading and writing mathematics harmony poetry and music strictly speaking drawing as aristotle tells us pol
3 § 1 was sometimes made a separate division i
music in this wider sense plato says should precede gymnastic and according to a remarkable passage in the protagoras 325 c the pupils in a greek school were actually instructed in reading and writing made to learn poetry by heart and taught to play on the lyre before they went to the gymnasium
the ages at which children should commence these various studies are not stated in the republic but in the viith book of the laws where the subject is treated more in detail the children begin going to school at ten and spend three years in learning to read and write and another three years in music laws 7
this agrees very fairly with the selection of the 363 most promising youth at the age of twenty rep 7
537 as it would allow a corresponding period of three years for gymnastic training ii
music strictly so called plays a great part in plato s scheme of education
he hopes by its aid to make the lives of his youthful scholars harmonious and gracious and to implant in their souls true conceptions of good and evil
music is a gift of the gods to men and was never intended as the many foolishly and blasphemously suppose merely to give us an idle pleasure tim
neither should a freeman aim at attaining perfect execution cp arist
6 §§ 7 15 in the laws 7
810 we are told that every one must go through the three years course of music neither more nor less whether he like or whether he dislike the study
both instruments and music are to be of a simple character in the republic only the lyre the pipe and the flute are tolerated and the dorian and phrygian harmonies
no change in the fashions of music is permitted for where there is licence in music there will be anarchy in the state
in this desire for simplicity and fixity in music plato was probably opposed to the tendencies of his own age
the severe harmony which had once characterized hellenic art was passing out of favour alike in architecture sculpture painting literature and music richer and more ornate styles prevailed

the republic is the first of plato s works in which he seriously examines the value of poetry in education and the place of the poets in the state
the question could hardly be neglected by the philosopher who proposed to construct an ideal polity or government of the best
for poetry played a great part in hellenic life the children learned whole poems by heart in their schools protag
810 c the rhapsode delighted the crowds at the festivals ion 535 the theatres were free or almost free to all costing but a drachma at the most apol
26 d the intervals of a banquet were filled up by conversation about the poets protag
the quarrel between philosophy and poetry was an ancient one which had found its first expression in the attacks of xenophanes 538 b c
in the earlier dialogues of plato the poets are treated with an ironical courtesy through which an antagonistic spirit is allowed here and there to appear they are winged and holy beings ion 534 who sing by inspiration 367 but at the same time are the worst possible critics of their own writings and the most self conceited of mortals apol
in the republic ii and iii plato begins the trial of poetry by the enquiry whether the tales and legends related by the epic and tragic poets are true in themselves or likely to furnish good examples to his future citizens
they cannot be true for they are contrary to the nature of god see s v god and they are certainly not proper lessons for youth
there must be a censorship of poetry and all objectionable passages expunged suitable rules and regulations will be laid down and to these the poets must conform
in the xth book the argument takes a deeper tone
the poet is proved to be an impostor thrice removed from the truth a wizard who steals the hearts of the unwary by his spells and enchantments
men easily fall into the habit of imitating what they admire and the lamentations and woes of the tragic hero and the unseemly buffoonery of the comedian are equally bad models for the citizens of a free and noble state
the poets must therefore be banished unless plato adds the lovers of poetry can persuade us of her innocence of the charges laid against her
in the laws a similar conclusion is reached the state is an imitation of the best life and the noblest form of tragedy
the legislator and the poet are rivals and the latter can only be tolerated if his words are in harmony with the laws of the state vii

518 d 527 e 533 d 540 a five forms of the state and soul 4
the psychology of the republic while agreeing generally with that of the other dialogues is in some respects a modification or developement of their conclusions the division of the soul into three elements reason spirit appetite here first assumes a precise form and henceforward has a permanent place in the language of philosophy cp introd
on this division the distinction between forms of government is based see s v government
virtue again is the harmony or accord of the different elements when the dictates of reason are enforced by passion against the appetites while vice is the anarchy or discord of the soul when passion and appetite join in rebellion against reason cp 4
906 c regarded from the intellectual side the soul is analysed into four faculties reason understanding faith knowledge of shadows
these severally correspond to the four divisions of knowledge 6
511 e two for intellect and two for opinion and thus arises the platonic proportion being becoming intellect opinion and science belief 372 understanding knowledge of shadows
these divisions are partly real partly formed by a logical process which as in so many distinctions of ancient philosophers has outrun fact and are further illustrated and explained by the allegory of the cave in book vii see introduction p
xciv the pre existence and the immortality of the soul are assumed
the doctrine of greek a na mnêsis or remembrance of a previous birth is not so much dwelt upon as in the meno phaedo or phaedrus neither is it made a proof of immortality meno 86 phaedo 73
it is apparently alluded to in the story of er where we are told that the pilgrims drank the waters of unmindfulness the foolish took too deep a draught but the wise were more moderate 10
in the xth book glaucon is supposed to receive with amazement socrates confident assertion of immortality although a previous allusion to another state of existence has passed unheeded 6
498 d and in earlier parts of the discussion e g 2
386 the censure which is passed on the common representations of hades implies in itself some belief in a future life cp introduction to phaedo vol
the argument for the immortality of the soul is not drawn out at great length or with the emphasis of the phaedo
it is chiefly of a verbal character all things which perish are destroyed by some inherent evil but the soul is not destroyed by sin which is the evil proper to her and must therefore be immortal cp introd
clxvi the condition of the soul after death is represented by plato in his favourite form of a myth cp meno 81 phaedo 88 gorg
the pamphylian warrior er who is supposed to have died in battle revives when placed on the funeral pyre and relates his experiences in the other world
he tells how the just are rewarded and the wicked punished and is privileged to describe the spectacle which he had witnessed of the choice of a new life by the pilgrim souls
the reward of release from bodily existence is not held out to the philosopher phaedo 114 c but his wisdom which has a deeper root than habit 10
619 preserves him from overhaste in his choice and ensures him a happy destiny the transmigration of souls is represented in the myth much as in the phaedrus and timaeus
plato in all likelihood derived the doctrine from an oriental source but through pythagorean channels
it probably had a real hold on his mind as it agreed or could be made to agree with the conviction which he elsewhere expresses of the remedial nature of punishment cp protag

the polity of which plato sketches the outline in the republic may be analysed into two principal elements i an hellenic state of the older or spartan type with some traits borrowed from athens ii an ideal city in which the citizens have all things in common and the government is carried on by a class of philosopher rulers who are selected by merit
these two elements are not perfectly combined and as aristotle complains pol
5 § 18 very much is left ill defined and uncertain i
like hellenic cities in general the number of the citizens is not to be great
the size of the state is limited by the requirement that it shall not be larger or smaller than is consistent with unity
the convenient number 5040 which is 374 suggested in the laws v 737 is regarded by aristotle pol
6 § 6 as an enormous multitude
again the individual is subordinate to the state
when adeimantus complains of the hard life which the citizens will lead like mercenaries in a garrison 4
419 he is answered by socrates that if the happiness of the whole is secured the happiness of the parts will inevitably follow
once more war is supposed to be the normal condition of the state and military service is imposed upon all
the profession of arms is the only one in which the citizen may properly engage
trade is regarded as dishonourable those who are good for nothing else sit in the agora buying and selling 2
371 d the warrior can spare no time for such an employment ib 374 c
in the laws plato s ideas enlarge he thinks that peace is to be preferred to war 1
628 and he speculates on the possibility of redeeming trade from reproach by compelling some of the best citizens to open a shop or keep a tavern 11
in these respects as well as in the introduction of common meals plato was probably influenced by the traditional ideal of sparta cp introd
the athenian element appears in the intellectual training of the citizens and generally in the atmosphere of grace and refinement which they are to breathe see s v art
the restless energy of the athenian character is perhaps reflected in the discipline imposed upon the ruling class 7
540 who when they have reached fifty are dispensed from continuous public service but must then devote themselves to abstract study and also be willing to take their turn when necessary at the helm of state cp laws 7
the most peculiar features of plato s state are 1 the community of property 2 the position of women 3 the government of philosophers 1 the first see s v though suggested in some measure by the example of sparta or crete cp arist
5 § 6 is not known to have been actually practised anywhere in hellas unless possibly among such a body as the pythagorean brotherhood 2 nothing in all the republic was probably stranger to his contemporaries than the place which plato assigns to women in the state
the community of wives and children though carefully guarded by him from the charge of licentiousness 5
458 e would appear worse in athenian eyes than the traditional licence of the spartan women arist
9 § 5 which so far as it really existed no doubt arose out of an excessive regard to physical considerations in marriage
again the equal share in education in war and in administration which the women are supposed to enjoy in plato s state was if not so revolting quite as contrary to common hellenic sentiment cp thucyd
the spartan women exercised a great influence on public affairs but this was mainly indirect cp laws 7
9 § 8 they did not hold office or learn the use of arms
at athens as is well known the women of the upper classes at least lived in an almost oriental seclusion and were wholly absorbed in household duties laws 7
3 finally the government of philosophers had no analogy in the hellenic world of 375 plato s time
he may have taken the suggestion from the stories of the pythagorean rule in magna graecia
but it is also possible that these accounts of the brotherhood of pythagoras some of which have reached us on very doubtful authority may be themselves to a considerable extent coloured and distorted by features adapted from the republic
