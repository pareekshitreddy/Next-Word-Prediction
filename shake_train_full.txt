2 when forty winters shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now will be a tattered weed of small worth held then being asked where all thy beauty lies where all the treasure of thy lusty days to say within thine own deep sunken eyes were an all eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use if thou couldst answer ‘this fair child of mine shall sum my count and make my old excuse ’ proving his beauty by succession thine
this were to be new made when thou art old and see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold
3 look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb of his self love to stop posterity
thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime so thou through windows of thine age shalt see despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live remembered not to be die single and thine image dies with thee
4 unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy
nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend and being frank she lends to those are free then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thyself alone thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive then how when nature calls thee to be gone what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee which used lives th’ executor to be
5 those hours that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel for never resting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone beauty o’er snowed and bareness every where then were not summer’s distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilled though they with winter meet leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
6 then let not winter’s ragged hand deface in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled make sweet some vial treasure thou some place with beauty’s treasure ere it be self killed that use is not forbidden usury which happies those that pay the willing loan that’s for thyself to breed another thee or ten times happier be it ten for one ten times thyself were happier than thou art if ten of thine ten times refigured thee then what could death do if thou shouldst depart leaving thee living in posterity
be not self willed for thou art much too fair to be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir
8 music to hear why hear’st thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well tuned sounds by unions married do offend thine ear they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear mark how one string sweet husband to another strikes each in each by mutual ordering resembling sire and child and happy mother who all in one one pleasing note do sing whose speechless song being many seeming one sings this to thee ‘thou single wilt prove none’
9 is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye that thou consum’st thyself in single life
10 for shame deny that thou bear’st love to any who for thyself art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many but that thou none lov’st is most evident for thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate that ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire o change thy thought that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind or to thyself at least kind hearted prove make thee another self for love of me that beauty still may live in thine or thee
13 o that you were your self but love you are no longer yours than you yourself here live against this coming end you should prepare and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination then you were yourself again after yourself’s decease when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay which husbandry in honour might uphold against the stormy gusts of winter’s day and barren rage of death’s eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know you had a father let your son say so
14 not from the stars do i my judgement pluck and yet methinks i have astronomy but not to tell of good or evil luck of plagues of dearths or seasons’ quality nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell pointing to each his thunder rain and wind or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert or else of thee this i prognosticate thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date
15 when i consider everything that grows holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checked even by the self same sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new
16 but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify yourself in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours and many maiden gardens yet unset with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair which this time’s pencil or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live yourself in eyes of men
to give away yourself keeps yourself still and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
17 who will believe my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life and shows not half your parts if i could write the beauty of your eyes and in fresh numbers number all your graces the age to come would say this poet lies such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces
so should my papers yellowed with their age be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue and your true rights be termed a poet’s rage and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time you should live twice —in it and in my rhyme
18 shall i compare thee to a summer’s day
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong my love shall in my verse ever live young
20 a woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted hast thou the master mistress of my passion a woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false women’s fashion an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling gilding the object whereupon it gazeth a man in hue all hues in his controlling which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting and by addition me of thee defeated by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure
21 so is it not with me as with that muse stirred by a painted beauty to his verse who heaven it self for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon with earth and sea’s rich gems with april’s first born flowers and all things rare that heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write and then believe me my love is as fair as any mother’s child though not so bright as those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air let them say more that like of hearsay well i will not praise that purpose not to sell
22 my glass shall not persuade me i am old so long as youth and thou are of one date but when in thee time’s furrows i behold then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee is but the seemly raiment of my heart which in thy breast doth live as thine in me how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary as i not for my self but for thee will bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill presume not on thy heart when mine is slain thou gav’st me thine not to give back again
23 as an unperfect actor on the stage who with his fear is put beside his part or some fierce thing replete with too much rage whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart so i for fear of trust forget to say the perfect ceremony of love’s rite and in mine own love’s strength seem to decay o’ercharged with burthen of mine own love’s might o let my looks be then the eloquence and dumb presagers of my speaking breast who plead for love and look for recompense more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
o learn to read what silent love hath writ to hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit
24 mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled thy beauty’s form in table of my heart my body is the frame wherein ’tis held and perspective it is best painter’s art
for through the painter must you see his skill to find where your true image pictured lies which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me are windows to my breast where through the sun delights to peep to gaze therein on thee yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art they draw but what they see know not the heart
25 let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlooked for joy in that i honour most great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the sun’s eye and in themselves their pride lies buried for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight after a thousand victories once foiled is from the book of honour razed quite and all the rest forgot for which he toiled then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed
26 lord of my love to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare in wanting words to show it but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy soul’s thought all naked will bestow it till whatsoever star that guides my moving points on me graciously with fair aspect and puts apparel on my tattered loving to show me worthy of thy sweet respect then may i dare to boast how i do love thee till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
27 weary with toil i haste me to my bed the dear respose for limbs with travel tired but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind when body’s work’s expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee and keep my drooping eyelids open wide looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my soul’s imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view which like a jewel hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind for thee and for my self no quiet find
28 how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest
when day’s oppression is not eased by night but day by night and night by day oppressed
and each though enemies to either’s reign do in consent shake hands to torture me the one by toil the other to complain how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please him thou art bright and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven so flatter i the swart complexioned night when sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even
30 when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in death’s dateless night and weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe and moan th’ expense of many a vanished sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell o’er the sad account of fore bemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restored and sorrows end
31 thy bosom is endeared with all hearts which i by lacking have supposed dead and there reigns love and all love’s loving parts and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye as interest of the dead which now appear but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live hung with the trophies of my lovers gone who all their parts of me to thee did give that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee and thou all they hast all the all of me
32 if thou survive my well contented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more re survey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bett’ring of the time and though they be outstripped by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought ’had my friend’s muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style i’ll read his for his love’
33 full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with all triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath masked him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth
34 why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds o’ertake me in my way hiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke
’tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my storm beaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss th’ offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offence’s cross
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
35 no more be grieved at that which thou hast done roses have thorns and silver fountains mud clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this authorizing thy trespass with compare my self corrupting salving thy amiss excusing thy sins more than thy sins are for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense thy adverse party is thy advocate and ’gainst my self a lawful plea commence such civil war is in my love and hate that i an accessary needs must be to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
36 let me confess that we two must be twain although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect though in our lives a separable spite which though it alter not love’s sole effect yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame nor thou with public kindness honour me unless thou take that honour from thy name but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report
37 as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth so i made lame by fortune’s dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit or any of these all or all or more entitled in thy parts do crowned sit i make my love engrafted to this store so then i am not lame poor nor despised whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficed and by a part of all thy glory live look what is best that best i wish in thee this wish i have then ten times happy me
38 how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse thine own sweet argument too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight for who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee when thou thyself dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate and he that calls on thee let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
39 o how thy worth with manners may i sing when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring and what is’t but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live and our dear love lose name of single one that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deserv’st alone o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
and that thou teachest how to make one twain by praising him here who doth hence remain
40 take all my loves my love yea take them all what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call all mine was thine before thou hadst this more then if for my love thou my love receivest i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear greater wrong than hate’s known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
41 those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am sometime absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what woman’s son will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee thine by thy beauty being false to me
42 that thou hast her it is not all my grief and yet it may be said i loved her dearly that she hath thee is of my wailing chief a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her because thou know’st i love her and for my sake even so doth she abuse me suff’ring my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my love’s gain and losing her my friend hath found that loss both find each other and i lose both twain and both for my sake lay on me this cross but here’s the joy my friend and i are one sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
43 when most i wink then do mine eyes best see for all the day they view things unrespected but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadow’s form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
all days are nights to see till i see thee and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
44 if the dull substance of my flesh were thought injurious distance should not stop my way for then despite of space i would be brought from limits far remote where thou dost stay no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time’s leisure with my moan
receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of either’s woe
45 the other two slight air and purging fire are both with thee wherever i abide the first my thought the other my desire these present absent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee my life being made of four with two alone sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
until life’s composition be recured by those swift messengers returned from thee who even but now come back again assured of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad i send them back again and straight grow sad
46 mine eye and heart are at a mortal war how to divide the conquest of thy sight mine eye my heart thy picture’s sight would bar my heart mine eye the freedom of that right my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierced with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to side this title is impanelled a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart and by their verdict is determined the clear eye’s moiety and the dear heart’s part
as thus mine eye’s due is thy outward part and my heart’s right thy inward love of heart
47 betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famished for a look or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother with my love’s picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart another time mine eye is my heart’s guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love thyself away art present still with me for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart’s and eye’s delight
48 how careful was i when i took my way each trifle under truest bars to thrust that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are most worthy comfort now my greatest grief thou best of dearest and mine only care art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not locked up in any chest save where thou art not though i feel thou art within the gentle closure of my breast from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part and even thence thou wilt be stol’n i fear for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
51 thus can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed no motion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire of perfect’st love being made shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race but love for love thus shall excuse my jade since from thee going he went wilful slow towards thee i’ll run and give him leave to go
52 so am i as the rich whose blessed key can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure the which he will not every hour survey for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in that long year set like stones of worth they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide to make some special instant special blest by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope being had to triumph being lacked to hope
53 what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helen’s cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessed shape we know
in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart
54 o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wantonly when summer’s breath their masked buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live unwooed and unrespected fade die to themselves
sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall fade my verse distills your truth
55 not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory
’gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers’ eyes
56 sweet love renew thy force be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite which but to day by feeding is allayed to morrow sharpened in his former might
so love be thou although to day thou fill thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness to morrow see again and do not kill the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore where two contracted new come daily to the banks that when they see return of love more blest may be the view
or call it winter which being full of care makes summer’s welcome thrice more wished more rare
57 being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the world without end hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will though you do any thing he thinks no ill 58 that god forbid that made me first your slave i should in thought control your times of pleasure or at your hand th’ account of hours to crave being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck th’ imprisoned absence of your liberty and patience tame to sufferance bide each check without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilage your time to what you will to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of self doing crime
i am to wait though waiting so be hell not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
59 if there be nothing new but that which is hath been before how are our brains beguiled which labouring for invention bear amis the second burthen of a former child
o that record could with a backward look even of five hundred courses of the sun show me your image in some antique book since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame whether we are mended or whether better they or whether revolution be the same
o sure i am the wits of former days to subjects worse have given admiring praise
60 like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore so do our minutes hasten to their end each changing place with that which goes before in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned crooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beauty’s brow feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
61 is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry to find out shames and idle hours in me the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere from me far off with others all too near
62 sin of self love possesseth all mine eye and all my soul and all my every part and for this sin there is no remedy it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine no shape so true no truth of such account and for my self mine own worth do define as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity mine own self love quite contrary i read self so self loving were iniquity
’tis thee myself that for myself i praise painting my age with beauty of thy days
63 against my love shall be as i am now with time’s injurious hand crushed and o’erworn when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn hath travelled on to age’s steepy night and all those beauties whereof now he’s king are vanishing or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring for such a time do i now fortify against confounding age’s cruel knife that he shall never cut from memory my sweet love’s beauty though my lover’s life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen and they shall live and he in them still green
64 when i have seen by time’s fell hand defaced the rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see down rased and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state or state it self confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away
this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose
65 since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality o’ersways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summer’s honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might that in black ink my love may still shine bright
66 tired with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimmed in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplaced and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgraced and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tongue tied by authority and folly doctor like controlling skill and simple truth miscalled simplicity and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone
67 ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace it self with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek and steal dead seeming of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is beggared of blood to blush through lively veins for she hath no exchequer now but his and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had in days long since before these last so bad
69 those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned but those same tongues that give thee so thine own in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind and that in guess they measure by thy deeds then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds but why thy odour matcheth not thy show the soil is this that thou dost common grow
70 that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect for slander’s mark was ever yet the fair the ornament of beauty is suspect a crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wooed of time for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love and thou present’st a pure unstained prime
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assailed or victor being charged yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise to tie up envy evermore enlarged if some suspect of ill masked not thy show then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
71 no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone
72 o lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me that you should love after my death dear love forget me quite for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie to do more for me than mine own desert and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart o lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue my name be buried where my body is and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth and so should you to love things nothing worth
73 that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away death’s second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the death bed whereon it must expire consumed with that which it was nourished by
this thou perceiv’st which makes thy love more strong to love that well which thou must leave ere long
74 but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away my life hath in this line some interest which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth which is his due my spirit is thine the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life the prey of worms my body being dead the coward conquest of a wretch’s knife too base of thee to be remembered the worth of that is that which it contains and that is this and this with thee remains
75 so are you to my thoughts as food to life or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strife as ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then bettered that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day or gluttoning on all or all away
76 why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside to new found methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told
77 thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste these vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know time’s thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory cannot contain commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find those children nursed delivered from thy brain to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
78 so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learned’s wing and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others’ works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance
79 whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decayed and my sick muse doth give an other place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that word from thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
80 o how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
but since your wort wide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wrecked i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was this my love was my decay
81 or i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall o’er read and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead you still shall live such virtue hath my pen where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
82 i grant thou wert not married to my muse and therefore mayst without attaint o’erlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue finding thy worth a limit past my praise and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised what strained touches rhetoric can lend thou truly fair wert truly sympathized in true plain words by thy true telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
83 i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found or thought i found you did exceed that barren tender of a poet’s debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you yourself being extant well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise
84 who is it that says most which can say more than this rich praise that you alone are you in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tell that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
85 my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compiled reserve their character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords in polished form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say ’tis so ’tis true and to the most of praise add something more but that is in my thought whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before then others for the breath of words respect me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
86 was it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filled up his line then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine
thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou know’st thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gav’st thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gav’st it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter
88 when thou shalt be disposed to set me light and place my merit in the eye of scorn upon thy side against my self i’ll fight and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn with mine own weakness being best acquainted upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed wherein i am attainted that thou in losing me shalt win much glory and i by this will be a gainer too for bending all my loving thoughts on thee the injuries that to my self i do doing thee vantage double vantage me
such is my love to thee i so belong that for thy right my self will bear all wrong
89 say that thou didst forsake me for some fault and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness and i straight will halt against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill to set a form upon desired change as i’ll my self disgrace knowing thy will i will acquaintance strangle and look strange be absent from thy walks and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell lest i too much profane should do it wronk and haply of our old acquaintance tell
for thee against my self i’ll vow debate for i must ne’er love him whom thou dost hate
90 then hate me when thou wilt if ever now now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow and do not drop in for an after loss ah do not when my heart hath ’scaped this sorrow come in the rearward of a conquered woe give not a windy night a rainy morrow to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortune’s might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe compared with loss of thee will not seem so
91 some glory in their birth some in their skill some in their wealth some in their body’s force some in their garments though new fangled ill some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth prouder than garments’ costs of more delight than hawks and horses be and having thee of all men’s pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take all this away and me most wretchcd make
92 but do thy worst to steal thyself away for term of life thou art assured mine and life no longer than thy love will stay for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs when in the least of them my life hath end i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind since that my life on thy revolt doth lie o what a happy title do i find happy to have thy love happy to die
but what’s so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not
93 so shall i live supposing thou art true like a deceived husband so love’s face may still seem love to me though altered new thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change in many’s looks the false heart’s history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whate’er thy thoughts or thy heart’s workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eve’s apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
95 how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beauty’s veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see
take heed dear heart of this large privilege the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
96 some say thy fault is youth some wantonness some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are loved of more and less thou mak’st faults graces that to thee resort as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemed so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated and for true things deemed
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report
97 how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
and yet this time removed was summer’s time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime like widowed wombs after their lords’ decease yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute
or if they sing ’tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winter’s near
98 from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april dressed in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summer’s story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lily’s white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemed it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play
99 the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my love’s breath
the purple pride which on thy soft check for complexion dwells in my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand and buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stol’n of both and to his robbery had annexed thy breath but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see but sweet or colour it had stol’n from thee
100 where art thou muse that thou forget’st so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spend’st thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my love’s sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay and make time’s spoils despised everywhere
give my love fame faster than time wastes life so thou prevent’st his scythe and crooked knife
101 o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too and therein dignified make answer muse wilt thou not haply say ’truth needs no colour with his colour fixed beauty no pencil beauty’s truth to lay but best is best if never intermixed’
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so for’t lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now
102 my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming the owner’s tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in summer’s front doth sing and stops her pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue because i would not dull you with my song
103 alack what poverty my muse brings forth that having such a scope to show her pride the argument all bare is of more worth than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face that over goes my blunt invention quite dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit your own glass shows you when you look in it
104 to me fair friend you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i eyed such seems your beauty still three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers’ pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes burned since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand steal from his figure and no pace perceived so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead
105 let not my love be called idolatry nor my beloved as an idol show since all alike my songs and praises be to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love to day to morrow kind still constant in a wondrous excellence therefore my verse to constancy confined one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument fair kind and true varying to other words and in this change is my invention spent three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one
106 when in the chronicle of wasted time i see descriptions of the fairest wights and beauty making beautiful old rhyme in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights then in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow i see their antique pen would have expressed even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies of this our time all you prefiguring and for they looked but with divining eyes they had not skill enough your worth to sing for we which now behold these present days have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
107 not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul of the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assured and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes since spite of him i’ll live in this poor rhyme while he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument when tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent
108 what’s in the brain that ink may character which hath not figured to thee my true spirit what’s new to speak what now to register that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine i must each day say o’er the very same counting no old thing old thou mine i thine even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
so that eternal love in love’s fresh case weighs not the dust and injury of age nor gives to necessary wrinkles place but makes antiquity for aye his page finding the first conceit of love there bred where time and outward form would show it dead
110 alas ’tis true i have gone here and there and made my self a motley to the view gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have looked on truth askance and strangely but by all above these blenches gave my heart another youth and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end mine appetite i never more will grind on newer proof to try an older friend a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best even to thy pure and most most loving breast
111 o for my sake do you with fortune chide the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand and almost thence my nature is subdued to what it works in like the dyer’s hand pity me then and wish i were renewed whilst like a willing patient i will drink potions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection no bitterness that i will bitter think nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye even that your pity is enough to cure me
112 your love and pity doth th’ impression fill which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow for what care i who calls me well or ill so you o’er green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care of others’ voices that my adder’s sense to critic and to flatterer stopped are mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred that all the world besides methinks are dead
incapable of more replete with you my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
114 or whether doth my mind being crowned with you drink up the monarch’s plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest such cherubins as your sweet self resemble creating every bad a perfect best as fast as objects to his beams assemble o ’tis the first ’tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is ’greeing and to his palate doth prepare the cup
if it be poisoned ’tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
115 those lines that i before have writ do lie even those that said i could not love you dearer yet then my judgment knew no reason why my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer but reckoning time whose millioned accidents creep in ’twixt vows and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp’st intents divert strong minds to the course of alt’ring things alas why fearing of time’s tyranny might i not then say ‘now i love you best ’ when i was certain o’er incertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow
116 let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wand’ring bark whose worth’s unknown although his height be taken
love’s not time’s fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle’s compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom if this be error and upon me proved i never writ nor no man ever loved
117 accuse me thus that i have scanted all wherein i should your great deserts repay forgot upon your dearest love to call whereto all bonds do tie me day by day that i have frequent been with unknown minds and given to time your own dear purchased right that i have hoisted sail to all the winds which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down and on just proof surmise accumulate bring me within the level of your frown but shoot not at me in your wakened hate since my appeal says i did strive to prove the constancy and virtue of your love
118 like as to make our appetite more keen with eager compounds we our palate urge as to prevent our maladies unseen we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being full of your ne’er cloying sweetness to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love t’ anticipate the ills that were not grew to faults assured and brought to medicine a healthful state which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
but thence i learn and find the lesson true drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
119 what potions have i drunk of siren tears distilled from limbecks foul as hell within applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears still losing when i saw my self to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true that better is by evil still made better
and ruined love when it is built anew grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent
120 that you were once unkind befriends me now and for that sorrow which i then did feel needs must i under my transgression bow unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken as i by yours y’have passed a hell of time and i a tyrant have no leisure taken to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have remembered my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits and soon to you as you to me then tendered the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
but that your trespass now becomes a fee mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
121 ’tis better to be vile than vile esteemed when not to be receives reproach of being and the just pleasure lost which is so deemed not by our feeling but by others’ seeing
for why should others’ false adulterate eyes give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level at my abuses reckon up their own i may be straight though they themselves be bevel by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown unless this general evil they maintain all men are bad and in their badness reign
122 thy gift thy tables are within my brain full charactered with lasting memory which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart have faculty by nature to subsist till each to razed oblivion yield his part of thee thy record never can be missed that poor retention could not so much hold nor need i tallies thy dear love to score therefore to give them from me was i bold to trust those tables that receive thee more to keep an adjunct to remember thee were to import forgetfulness in me
124 if my dear love were but the child of state it might for fortune’s bastard be unfathered as subject to time’s love or to time’s hate weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
no it was builded far from accident it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls under the blow of thralled discontent whereto th’ inviting time our fashion calls it fears not policy that heretic which works on leases of short numbered hours but all alone stands hugely politic that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
to this i witness call the fools of time which die for goodness who have lived for crime
125 were’t aught to me i bore the canopy with my extern the outward honouring or laid great bases for eternity which proves more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour lose all and more by paying too much rent for compound sweet forgoing simple savour pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart and take thou my oblation poor but free which is not mixed with seconds knows no art but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou suborned informer a true soul when most impeached stands least in thy control
126 o thou my lovely boy who in thy power dost hold time’s fickle glass his fickle hour who hast by waning grown and therein show’st thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow’st
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure she may detain but not still keep her treasure
her audit though delayed answered must be and her quietus is to render thee
127 in the old age black was not counted fair or if it were it bore not beauty’s name but now is black beauty’s successive heir and beauty slandered with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on nature’s power fairing the foul with art’s false borrowed face sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black her eyes so suited and they mourners seem at such who not born fair no beauty lack slandering creation with a false esteem yet so they mourn becoming of their woe that every tongue says beauty should look so
128 how oft when thou my music music play’st upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway’st the wiry concord that mine ear confounds do i envy those jacks that nimble leap to kiss the tender inward of thy hand whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state and situation with those dancing chips o’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait making dead wood more blest than living lips since saucy jacks so happy are in this give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
129 th’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action and till action lust is perjured murd’rous bloody full of blame savage extreme rude cruel not to trust enjoyed no sooner but despised straight past reason hunted and no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so had having and in quest to have extreme a bliss in proof and proved a very woe before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
130 my mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red than her lips red if snow be white why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damasked red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know that music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare as any she belied with false compare
131 thou art as tyrannous so as thou art as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel for well thou know’st to my dear doting heart thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold thy face hath not the power to make love groan to say they err i dare not be so bold although i swear it to my self alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear a thousand groans but thinking on thy face one on another’s neck do witness bear thy black is fairest in my judgment’s place
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds and thence this slander as i think proceeds
132 thine eyes i love and they as pitying me knowing thy heart torment me with disdain have put on black and loving mourners be looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven better becomes the grey cheeks of the east nor that full star that ushers in the even doth half that glory to the sober west as those two mourning eyes become thy face o let it then as well beseem thy heart to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace and suit thy pity like in every part
then will i swear beauty herself is black and all they foul that thy complexion lack
133 beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan for that deep wound it gives my friend and me is’t not enough to torture me alone but slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be
me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken and my next self thou harder hast engrossed of him my self and thee i am forsaken a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed prison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward but then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail whoe’er keeps me let my heart be his guard thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee perforce am thine and all that is in me
134 so now i have confessed that he is thine and i my self am mortgaged to thy will my self i’ll forfeit so that other mine thou wilt restore to be my comfort still but thou wilt not nor he will not be free for thou art covetous and he is kind he learned but surety like to write for me under that bond that him as fist doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take thou usurer that put’st forth all to use and sue a friend came debtor for my sake so him i lose through my unkind abuse
him have i lost thou hast both him and me he pays the whole and yet am i not free
135 whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will and will to boot and will in overplus more than enough am i that vex thee still to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still and in abundance addeth to his store so thou being rich in will add to thy will one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill think all but one and me in that one will
136 if thy soul check thee that i come so near swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will and will thy soul knows is admitted there thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
will will fulfil the treasure of thy love ay fill it full with wills and my will one in things of great receipt with case we prove among a number one is reckoned none
then in the number let me pass untold though in thy store’s account i one must be for nothing hold me so it please thee hold that nothing me a something sweet to thee
make but my name thy love and love that still and then thou lov’st me for my name is will
137 thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks be anchored in the bay where all men ride why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot which my heart knows the wide world’s common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not to put fair truth upon so foul a face
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred and to this false plague are they now transferred
138 when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutored youth unlearned in the world’s false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her false speaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love’s best habit is in seeming trust and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i lie with her and she with me and in our faults by lies we flattered be
139 o call not me to justify the wrong that thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue use power with power and slay me not by art tell me thou lov’st elsewhere but in my sight dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside what need’st thou wound with cunning when thy might is more than my o’erpressed defence can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows her pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries yet do not so but since i am near slain kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
140 be wise as thou art cruel do not press my tongue tied patience with too much disdain lest sorrow lend me words and words express the manner of my pity wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were though not to love yet love to tell me so as testy sick men when their deaths be near no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad and in my madness might speak ill of thee now this ill wresting world is grown so bad mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
that i may not be so nor thou belied bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
141 in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes for they in thee a thousand errors note but ’tis my heart that loves what they despise who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine cars with thy tongue’s tune delighted nor tender feeling to base touches prone nor taste nor smell desire to be invited to any sensual feast with thee alone but my five wits nor my five senses can dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be only my plague thus far i count my gain that she that makes me sin awards me pain
142 love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving o but with mine compare thou thine own state and thou shalt find it merits not reproving or if it do not from those lips of thine that have profaned their scarlet ornaments and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine robbed others’ beds’ revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lov’st those whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee root pity in thy heart that when it grows thy pity may deserve to pitied be
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide by self example mayst thou be denied
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will if thou turn back and my loud crying still
144 two loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman coloured ill to win me soon to hell my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turned fiend suspect i may yet not directly tell but being both from me both to each friend i guess one angel in another’s hell
yet this shall i ne’er know but live in doubt till my bad angel fire my good one out
145 those lips that love’s own hand did make breathed forth the sound that said ‘i hate’ to me that languished for her sake but when she saw my woeful state straight in her heart did mercy come chiding that tongue that ever sweet was used in giving gentle doom and taught it thus anew to greet ‘i hate’ she altered with an end that followed it as gentle day doth follow night who like a fiend from heaven to hell is flown away
‘i hate’ from hate away she threw and saved my life saying ‘not you’
146 poor soul the centre of my sinful earth my sinful earth these rebel powers array why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess eat up thy charge
then soul live thou upon thy servant’s loss and let that pine to aggravate thy store buy terms divine in selling hours of dross within be fed without be rich no more so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men and death once dead there’s no more dying then
147 my love is as a fever longing still for that which longer nurseth the disease feeding on that which doth preserve the ill th’ uncertain sickly appetite to please my reason the physician to my love angry that his prescriptions are not kept hath left me and i desperate now approve desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care and frantic mad with evermore unrest my thoughts and my discourse as mad men’s are at random from the truth vainly expressed
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright who art as black as hell as dark as night
what eyes hath love put in my head which have no correspondence with true sight or if they have where is my judgment fled that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote love’s eye is not so true as all men’s no how can it
o how can love’s eye be true that is so vexed with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view the sun it self sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keep’st me blind lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
149 canst thou o cruel say i love thee not when i against my self with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend on whom frown’st thou that i do fawn upon nay if thou lour’st on me do i not spend revenge upon my self with present moan
what merit do i in my self respect that is so proud thy service to despise when all my best doth worship thy defect commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind those that can see thou lov’st and i am blind
150 o from what power hast thou this powerful might with insufficiency my heart to sway to make me give the lie to my true sight and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill that in the very refuse of thy deeds there is such strength and warrantise of skill that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
if thy unworthiness raised love in me more worthy i to be beloved of thee
151 love is too young to know what conscience is yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray my nobler part to my gross body’s treason my soul doth tell my body that he may triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason but rising at thy name doth point out thee as his triumphant prize proud of this pride he is contented thy poor drudge to be to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call her love for whose dear love i rise and fall
152 in loving thee thou know’st i am forsworn but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths’ breach do i accuse thee when i break twenty
i am perjured most for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness or made them swear against the thing they see
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i to swear against the truth so foul a lie
153 cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep a maid of dian’s this advantage found and his love kindling fire did quickly steep in a cold valley fountain of that ground which borrowed from this holy fire of love a dateless lively heat still to endure and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove against strange maladies a sovereign cure but at my mistress’ eye love’s brand new fired the boy for trial needs would touch my breast i sick withal the help of bath desired and thither hied a sad distempered guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies where cupid got new fire my mistress’ eyes
154 the little love god lying once asleep laid by his side his heart inflaming brand whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep came tripping by but in her maiden hand the fairest votary took up that fire which many legions of true hearts had warmed and so the general of hot desire was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
this brand she quenched in a cool well by which from love’s fire took heat perpetual growing a bath and healthful remedy for men discased but i my mistress’ thrall came there for cure and this by that i prove love’s fire heats water water cools not love

in delivering my son from me i bury a second husband
and i in going madam weep o’er my father’s death anew but i must attend his majesty’s command to whom i am now in ward evermore in subjection
you shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father
he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance
what hope is there of his majesty’s amendment
he hath abandon’d his physicians madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time
this young gentlewoman had a father—o that “had ” how sad a passage ’tis —whose skill was almost as great as his honesty had it stretch’d so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work
would for the king’s sake he were living
i think it would be the death of the king’s disease
how called you the man you speak of madam
he was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so gerard de narbon
he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have liv’d still if knowledge could be set up against mortality
what is it my good lord the king languishes of
i heard not of it before
i would it were not notorious
was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon
his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking
i have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too
in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness
your commendations madam get from her tears
’tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in
the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek
no more of this helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have
i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too
moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living
if the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortal
madam i desire your holy wishes
be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father in manners as in shape
thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee and thy goodness share with thy birthright
love all trust a few do wrong to none
be able for thine enemy rather in power than use and keep thy friend under thy own life’s key
be check’d for silence but never tax’d for speech
what heaven more will that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down fall on thy head
my lord ’tis an unseason’d courtier good my lord advise him
he cannot want the best that shall attend his love
the best wishes that can be forg’d in your thoughts be servants to you
to helena be comfortable to my mother your mistress and make much of her
farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father
i think not on my father and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him
i have forgot him my imagination carries no favour in’t but bertram’s
i am undone there is no living none if bertram be away
’twere all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it he is so above me
in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted not in his sphere
th’ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love
’twas pretty though a plague to see him every hour to sit and draw his arched brows his hawking eye his curls in our heart’s table —heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour
but now he’s gone and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his relics
one that goes with him i love him for his sake and yet i know him a notorious liar think him a great way fool solely a coward yet these fix’d evils sit so fit in him that they take place when virtue’s steely bones looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind withal full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question
man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him
but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak
unfold to us some warlike resistance
man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up
bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up
is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men
virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your city
it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity
loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost
that you were made of is metal to make virgins
virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost
i will stand for’t a little though therefore i die a virgin
there’s little can be said in’t ’tis against the rule of nature
to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience
he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature
virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of self love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon
keep it not you cannot choose but lose by’t
within the year it will make itself two which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse
how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
marry ill to like him that ne’er it likes
’tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth
off with’t while ’tis vendible answer the time of request
virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now
your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek
and your virginity your old virginity is like one of our french wither’d pears it looks ill it eats drily marry ’tis a wither’d pear it was formerly better marry yet ’tis a wither’d pear
there shall your master have a thousand loves a mother and a mistress and a friend a phoenix captain and an enemy a guide a goddess and a sovereign a counsellor a traitress and a dear his humble ambition proud humility his jarring concord and his discord dulcet his faith his sweet disaster with a world of pretty fond adoptious christendoms that blinking cupid gossips
now shall he— i know not what he shall
the court’s a learning place and he is one
that wishing well had not a body in’t which might be felt that we the poorer born whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes might with effects of them follow our friends and show what we alone must think which never returns us thanks
monsieur parolles my lord calls for you
if i can remember thee i will think of thee at court
monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star
the wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars
when he was retrograde i think rather
you go so much backward when you fight
so is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well
i am so full of business i cannot answer thee acutely
i will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away
when thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends
get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee
our remedies oft in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky gives us free scope only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
what power is it which mounts my love so high that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things
impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be
who ever strove to show her merit that did miss her love
the king’s disease —my project may deceive me but my intents are fix’d and will not leave me

the florentines and senoys are by th’ ears have fought with equal fortune and continue a braving war
nay ’tis most credible we here receive it a certainty vouch’d from our cousin austria with caution that the florentine will move us for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business and would seem to have us make denial
his love and wisdom approv’d so to your majesty may plead for amplest credence
he hath arm’d our answer and florence is denied before he comes yet for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service freely have they leave to stand on either part
it well may serve a nursery to our gentry who are sick for breathing and exploit
it is the count rossillon my good lord young bertram
youth thou bear’st thy father’s face frank nature rather curious than in haste hath well compos’d thee
thy father’s moral parts mayst thou inherit too
my thanks and duty are your majesty’s
i would i had that corporal soundness now as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership
he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest
he lasted long but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act
it much repairs me to talk of your good father in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe today in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awak’d them and his honour clock to itself knew the true minute when exception bid him speak and at this time his tongue obey’d his hand
who were below him he us’d as creatures of another place and bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks making them proud of his humility in their poor praise he humbled
such a man might be a copy to these younger times which followed well would demonstrate them now but goers backward
his good remembrance sir lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech
he would always say — methinks i hear him now his plausive words he scatter’d not in ears but grafted them to grow there and to bear —“let me not live ” this his good melancholy oft began on the catastrophe and heel of pastime when it was out —“let me not live” quoth he “after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments whose constancies expire before their fashions ” this he wish’d
i after him do after him wish too since i nor wax nor honey can bring home i quickly were dissolved from my hive to give some labourers room
you’re lov’d sir they that least lend it you shall lack you first
i fill a place i know’t
how long is’t count since the physician at your father’s died
some six months since my lord
if he were living i would try him yet — lend me an arm —the rest have worn me out with several applications nature and sickness debate it at their leisure
welcome count my son’s no dearer
what say you of this gentlewoman
madam the care i have had to even your content i wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish them
the complaints i have heard of you i do not all believe ’tis my slowness that i do not for i know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours
’tis not unknown to you madam i am a poor fellow
no madam ’tis not so well that i am poor though many of the rich are damned but if i may have your ladyship’s good will to go to the world isbel the woman and i will do as we may
wilt thou needs be a beggar
i do beg your good will in this case
in isbel’s case and mine own
service is no heritage and i think i shall never have the blessing of god till i have issue of my body for they say barnes are blessings
tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry
my poor body madam requires it i am driven on by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives
is this all your worship’s reason
faith madam i have other holy reasons such as they are
i have been madam a wicked creature as you and all flesh and blood are and indeed i do marry that i may repent
thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness
i am out of friends madam and i hope to have friends for my wife’s sake
such friends are thine enemies knave
y’are shallow madam in great friends for the knaves come to do that for me which i am a weary of
he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop if i be his cuckold he’s my drudge
he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses my wife is my friend
if men could be contented to be what they are there were no fear in marriage for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist howsome’er their hearts are sever’d in religion their heads are both one they may jowl horns together like any deer i’ the herd
wilt thou ever be a foul mouth’d and calumnious knave
a prophet i madam and i speak the truth the next way for i the ballad will repeat which men full true shall find your marriage comes by destiny your cuckoo sings by kind countess
get you gone sir i’ll talk with you more anon
may it please you madam that he bid helen come to you of her i am to speak
sirrah tell my gentlewoman i would speak with her helen i mean
sings was this fair face the cause quoth she why the grecians sacked troy
fond done done fond was this king priam’s joy
with that she sighed as she stood with that she sighed as she stood and gave this sentence then among nine bad if one be good among nine bad if one be good there’s yet one good in ten countess
one good woman in ten madam which is a purifying o’ the song
would god would serve the world so all the year
we’d find no fault with the tithe woman if i were the parson
and we might have a good woman born but or every blazing star or at an earthquake ’twould mend the lottery well a man may draw his heart out ere he pluck one
you’ll be gone sir knave and do as i command you
that man should be at woman’s command and yet no hurt done
though honesty be no puritan yet it will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart
i am going forsooth the business is for helen to come hither
i know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely
her father bequeath’d her to me and she herself without other advantage may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds there is more owing her than is paid and more shall be paid her than she’ll demand
madam i was very late more near her than i think she wish’d me alone she was and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears she thought i dare vow for her they touch’d not any stranger sense
her matter was she loved your son
fortune she said was no goddess that had put such difference betwixt their two estates love no god that would not extend his might only where qualities were level diana no queen of virgins that would suffer her poor knight surpris’d without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward
this she deliver’d in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e’er i heard virgin exclaim in which i held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns you something to know it
you have discharg’d this honestly keep it to yourself many likelihoods inform’d me of this before which hung so tottering in the balance that i could neither believe nor misdoubt
pray you leave me stall this in your bosom and i thank you for your honest care
i will speak with you further anon
even so it was with me when i was young if ever we are nature’s these are ours this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong our blood to us this to our blood is born it is the show and seal of nature’s truth where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth
by our remembrances of days foregone such were our faults or then we thought them none
her eye is sick on’t i observe her now
you know helen i am a mother to you
when i said a mother methought you saw a serpent
what’s in mother that you start at it
i say i am your mother and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine
’tis often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds
you ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan yet i express to you a mother’s care
does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother
what’s the matter that this distempered messenger of wet the many colour’d iris rounds thine eye
—why that you are my daughter
i say i am your mother
pardon madam the count rossillon cannot be my brother
i am from humble he from honoured name no note upon my parents his all noble my master my dear lord he is and i his servant live and will his vassal die
he must not be my brother
you are my mother madam would you were— so that my lord your son were not my brother — indeed my mother
or were you both our mothers i care no more for than i do for heaven so i were not his sister
can’t no other but i your daughter he must be my brother
yes helen you might be my daughter in law
god shield you mean it not
daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse
my fear hath catch’d your fondness now i see the mystery of your loneliness and find your salt tears’ head
now to all sense ’tis gross you love my son invention is asham’d against the proclamation of thy passion to say thou dost not
therefore tell me true but tell me then ’tis so for look thy cheeks confess it t’one to th’other and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviours that in their kind they speak it only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue that truth should be suspected
if it be so you have wound a goodly clew if it be not forswear’t howe’er i charge thee as heaven shall work in me for thine avail to tell me truly
do not you love him madam
go not about my love hath in’t a bond whereof the world takes note
come come disclose the state of your affection for your passions have to the full appeach’d
then i confess here on my knee before high heaven and you that before you and next unto high heaven i love your son
my friends were poor but honest so’s my love
be not offended for it hurts not him that he is lov’d of me i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit nor would i have him till i do deserve him yet never know how that desert should be
i know i love in vain strive against hope yet in this captious and inteemable sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still
thus indian like religious in mine error i adore the sun that looks upon his worshipper but knows of him no more
my dearest madam let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do but if yourself whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly that your dian was both herself and love o then give pity to her whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose that seeks not to find that her search implies but riddle like lives sweetly where she dies
had you not lately an intent —speak truly — to go to paris
i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and prov’d effects such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty and that he will’d me in heedfull’st reservation to bestow them as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note
amongst the rest there is a remedy approv’d set down to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render’d lost
this was your motive for paris was it
my lord your son made me to think of this else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then
but think you helen if you should tender your supposed aid he would receive it
he and his physicians are of a mind he that they cannot help him they that they cannot help
how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin when the schools embowell’d of their doctrine have let off the danger to itself
there’s something in’t more than my father’s skill which was the great’st of his profession that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by th’ luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour but give me leave to try success i’d venture the well lost life of mine on his grace’s cure
by such a day an hour
why helen thou shalt have my leave and love means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court
i’ll stay at home and pray god’s blessing into thy attempt
be gone tomorrow and be sure of this what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss
a room in the king’s palace
enter the king with young lords taking leave for the florentine war bertram parolles and attendants
farewell young lords these warlike principles do not throw from you and you my lords farewell share the advice betwixt you if both gain all the gift doth stretch itself as ’tis receiv’d and is enough for both
’tis our hope sir after well ent’red soldiers to return and find your grace in health
no no it cannot be and yet my heart will not confess he owes the malady that doth my life besiege
whether i live or die be you the sons of worthy frenchmen let higher italy — those bated that inherit but the fall of the last monarchy—see that you come not to woo honour but to wed it when the bravest questant shrinks find what you seek that fame may cry you loud
health at your bidding serve your majesty
those girls of italy take heed of them they say our french lack language to deny if they demand beware of being captives before you serve
the king retires to a couch first lord
o my sweet lord that you will stay behind us
’tis not his fault the spark
i am commanded here and kept a coil with “too young” and “the next year” and “’tis too early”
an thy mind stand to’t boy steal away bravely
i shall stay here the forehorse to a smock creaking my shoes on the plain masonry till honour be bought up and no sword worn but one to dance with
i am your accessary and so farewell
i grow to you and our parting is a tortur’d body
noble heroes my sword and yours are kin
good sparks and lustrous a word good metals
you shall find in the regiment of the spinii one captain spurio with his cicatrice an emblem of war here on his sinister cheek it was this very sword entrench’d it
say to him i live and observe his reports for me
mars dote on you for his novices
exeunt lords what will ye do
use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords you have restrain’d yourself within the list of too cold an adieu
be more expressive to them for they wear themselves in the cap of the time there do muster true gait eat speak and move under the influence of the most receiv’d star and though the devil lead the measure such are to be followed
after them and take a more dilated farewell
worthy fellows and like to prove most sinewy sword men

pardon my lord kneeling for me and for my tidings
i’ll fee thee to stand up
then here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon
i would you had kneel’d my lord to ask me mercy and that at my bidding you could so stand up
i would i had so i had broke thy pate and ask’d thee mercy for’t
good faith across but my good lord ’tis thus will you be cur’d of your infirmity
o will you eat no grapes my royal fox
yes but you will my noble grapes and if my royal fox could reach them
i have seen a medicine that’s able to breathe life into a stone quicken a rock and make you dance canary with sprightly fire and motion whose simple touch is powerful to araise king pippen nay to give great charlemain a pen in’s hand and write to her a love line
my lord there’s one arriv’d if you will see her
now by my faith and honour if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance i have spoke with one that in her sex her years profession wisdom and constancy hath amaz’d me more than i dare blame my weakness
will you see her for that is her demand and know her business
that done laugh well at me
now good lafew bring in the admiration that we with thee may spend our wonder too or take off thine by wond’ring how thou took’st it
nay i’ll fit you and not be all day neither
thus he his special nothing ever prologues
this is his majesty say your mind to him
a traitor you do look like but such traitors his majesty seldom fears i am cressid’s uncle that dare leave two together
now fair one does your business follow us
gerard de narbon was my father in what he did profess well found
the rather will i spare my praises towards him
on his bed of death many receipts he gave me chiefly one which as the dearest issue of his practice and of his old experience the only darling he bade me store up as a triple eye safer than mine own two more dear i have so and hearing your high majesty is touch’d with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power i come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness
we thank you maiden but may not be so credulous of cure when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidable estate
i say we must not so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope to prostitute our past cure malady to empirics or to dissever so our great self and our credit to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem
my duty then shall pay me for my pains
i will no more enforce mine office on you humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one to bear me back again
i cannot give thee less to be call’d grateful
thou thought’st to help me and such thanks i give as one near death to those that wish him live
but what at full i know thou know’st no part i knowing all my peril thou no art
what i can do can do no hurt to try since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy
he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister
so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown when judges have been babes
great floods have flown from simple sources and great seas have dried when miracles have by the great’st been denied
oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits
thy pains not us’d must by thyself be paid proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
inspired merit so by breath is barr’d
it is not so with him that all things knows as ’tis with us that square our guess by shows but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men
dear sir to my endeavours give consent of heaven not me make an experiment
i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim but know i think and think i know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure
within what space hop’st thou my cure
ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly health shall live free and sickness freely die
upon thy certainty and confidence what dar’st thou venture
tax of impudence a strumpet’s boldness a divulged shame traduc’d by odious ballads my maiden’s name sear’d otherwise ne worse of worst extended with vildest torture let my life be ended
methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak his powerful sound within an organ weak and what impossibility would slay in common sense sense saves another way
thy life is dear for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate youth beauty wisdom courage all that happiness and prime can happy call
thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate
sweet practiser thy physic i will try that ministers thine own death if i die
if i break time or flinch in property of what i spoke unpitied let me die and well deserv’d
not helping death’s my fee but if i help what do you promise me
but will you make it even
ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand what husband in thy power i will command exempted be from me the arrogance to choose from forth the royal blood of france my low and humble name to propagate with any branch or image of thy state but such a one thy vassal whom i know is free for me to ask thee to bestow
here is my hand the premises observ’d thy will by my performance shall be serv’d so make the choice of thy own time for i thy resolv’d patient on thee still rely
more should i question thee and more i must though more to know could not be more to trust from whence thou cam’st how tended on but rest unquestion’d welcome and undoubted bless’d
give me some help here ho

a room in the countess’s palace
come on sir i shall now put you to the height of your breeding
i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught
i know my business is but to the court
why what place make you special when you put off that with such contempt
truly madam if god have lent a man any manners he may easily put it off at court he that cannot make a leg put off’s cap kiss his hand and say nothing has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed such a fellow to say precisely were not for the court but for me i have an answer will serve all men
marry that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions
it is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks—the pin buttock the quatch buttock the brawn buttock or any buttock
will your answer serve fit to all questions
as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your french crown for your taffety punk as tib’s rush for tom’s forefinger as a pancake for shrove tuesday a morris for may day as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
have you i say an answer of such fitness for all questions
from below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit any question
it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands
but a trifle neither in good faith if the learned should speak truth of it
here it is and all that belongs to’t
ask me if i am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn
to be young again if we could i will be a fool in question hoping to be the wiser by your answer
i pray you sir are you a courtier
more more a hundred of them
sir i am a poor friend of yours that loves you
i think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
nay put me to’t i warrant you
you were lately whipp’d sir as i think
do you cry ‘o lord sir ’ at your whipping and ‘spare not me’
indeed your ‘o lord sir ’ is very sequent to your whipping
you would answer very well to a whipping if you were but bound to’t
i ne’er had worse luck in my life in my ‘o lord sir ’ i see things may serve long but not serve ever

fair maid send forth thine eye

thy frank election make thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress fall when love please

gentlemen heaven hath through me restor’d the king to health
we understand it and thank heaven for you
i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest that i protest i simply am a maid
please it your majesty i have done already
the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me “we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever we’ll ne’er come there again ” king
make choice and see who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
now dian from thy altar do i fly and to imperial love that god most high do my sighs stream
to first lord sir will you hear my suit
thanks sir all the rest is mute
i had rather be in this choice than throw ames ace for my life
to second lord the honour sir that flames in your fair eyes before i speak too threat’ningly replies
love make your fortunes twenty times above her that so wishes and her humble love
my wish receive which great love grant and so i take my leave

these boys are boys of ice they’ll none have her

to fourth lord you are too young too happy and too good to make yourself a son out of my blood
fair one i think not so
i am sure thy father drank wine
but if thou beest not an ass i am a youth of fourteen i have known thee already
to bertram i dare not say i take you but i give me and my service ever whilst i live into your guiding power
why then young bertram take her she’s thy wife
i shall beseech your highness in such a business give me leave to use the help of mine own eyes
know’st thou not bertram what she has done for me
yes my good lord but never hope to know why i should marry her
thou know’st she has rais’d me from my sickly bed
but follows it my lord to bring me down must answer for your raising
i know her well she had her breeding at my father’s charge a poor physician’s daughter my wife
’tis only title thou disdain’st in her the which i can build up
strange is it that our bloods of colour weight and heat pour’d all together would quite confound distinction yet stands off in differences so mighty
if she be all that is virtuous save what thou dislik’st a poor physician’s daughter —thou dislik’st— of virtue for the name
from lowest place when virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by the doer’s deed
where great additions swell’s and virtue none it is a dropsied honour
good alone is good without a name vileness is so the property by what it is should go not by the title
she is young wise fair in these to nature she’s immediate heir and these breed honour that is honour’s scorn which challenges itself as honour’s born and is not like the sire
honours thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our fore goers
the mere word’s a slave debauch’d on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as oft is dumb where dust and damn’d oblivion is the tomb of honour’d bones indeed
if thou canst like this creature as a maid i can create the rest
virtue and she is her own dower honour and wealth from me
i cannot love her nor will strive to do ’t
thou wrong’st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
that you are well restor’d my lord i am glad
my honour’s at the stake which to defeat i must produce my power
here take her hand proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert that canst not dream we poising us in her defective scale shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow
check thy contempt obey our will which travails in thy good believe not thy disdain but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee in the name of justice without all terms of pity
pardon my gracious lord for i submit my fancy to your eyes
when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it i find that she which late was in my nobler thoughts most base is now the praised of the king who so ennobled is as ’twere born so
take her by the hand and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise if not to thy estate a balance more replete
good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now born brief and be perform’d tonight
the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space expecting absent friends
as thou lov’st her thy love’s to me religious else does err

you are too old sir let it satisfy you you are too old
i must tell thee sirrah i write man to which title age cannot bring thee
what i dare too well do i dare not do
i did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty wise fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel it might pass
yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden
i have now found thee when i lose thee again i care not
yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and that thou art scarce worth
hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee— lafew
do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou hasten thy trial which if—lord have mercy on thee for a hen
so my good window of lattice fare thee well thy casement i need not open for i look through thee
my lord you give me most egregious indignity
ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it
i have not my lord deserv’d it
yes good faith every dram of it and i will not bate thee a scruple
ev’n as soon as thou canst for thou hast to pull at a smack o’ th’ contrary
if ever thou beest bound in thy scarf and beaten thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage
i have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee or rather my knowledge that i may say in the default “he is a man i know ” parolles
my lord you do me most insupportable vexation
i would it were hell pains for thy sake and my poor doing eternal for doing i am past as i will by thee in what motion age will give me leave
well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me scurvy old filthy scurvy lord
well i must be patient there is no fettering of authority
i’ll beat him by my life if i can meet him with any convenience an he were double and double a lord
i’ll have no more pity of his age than i would have of—i’ll beat him and if i could but meet him again
sirrah your lord and master’s married there’s news for you you have a new mistress
i most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs
he is my good lord whom i serve above is my master
the devil it is that’s thy master
why dost thou garter up thy arms o’ this fashion
dost make hose of thy sleeves
thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands
by mine honour if i were but two hours younger i’d beat thee
methink’st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee
i think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee
this is hard and undeserved measure my lord
go to sir you were beaten in italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate you are a vagabond and no true traveller
you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry
you are not worth another word else i’d call you knave
good very good it is so then
good very good let it be conceal’d awhile
undone and forfeited to cares for ever
although before the solemn priest i have sworn i will not bed her
o my parolles they have married me
i’ll to the tuscan wars and never bed her
france is a dog hole and it no more merits the tread of a man’s foot to the wars
there’s letters from my mother what th’ import is i know not yet
to th’ wars my boy to th’ wars
he wears his honour in a box unseen that hugs his kicky wicky here at home spending his manly marrow in her arms which should sustain the bound and high curvet of mars’s fiery steed
france is a stable we that dwell in’t jades therefore to th’ war
it shall be so i’ll send her to my house acquaint my mother with my hate to her and wherefore i am fled write to the king that which i durst not speak
his present gift shall furnish me to those italian fields where noble fellows strike
war is no strife to the dark house and the detested wife
will this caprichio hold in thee art sure
go with me to my chamber and advise me
tomorrow i’ll to the wars she to her single sorrow
why these balls bound there’s noise in it
’tis hard a young man married is a man that’s marr’d
therefore away and leave her bravely go
the king has done you wrong but hush ’tis so
my mother greets me kindly is she well
she is not well but yet she has her health she’s very merry but yet she is not well
but thanks be given she’s very well and wants nothing i’ the world but yet she is not well
if she be very well what does she ail that she’s not very well
truly she’s very well indeed but for two things
one that she’s not in heaven whither god send her quickly
the other that she’s in earth from whence god send her quickly
i hope sir i have your good will to have mine own good fortune
you had my prayers to lead them on and to keep them on have them still
o my knave how does my old lady
so that you had her wrinkles and i her money i would she did as you say
marry you are the wiser man for many a man’s tongue shakes out his master’s undoing
to say nothing to do nothing to know nothing and to have nothing is to be a great part of your title which is within a very little of nothing
you should have said sir before a knave thou art a knave that is before me thou art a knave
go to thou art a witty fool i have found thee
did you find me in yourself sir
or were you taught to find me
the search sir was profitable and much fool may you find in you even to the world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter

madam my lord will go away tonight a very serious business calls on him
the great prerogative and right of love which as your due time claims he does acknowledge but puts it off to a compell’d restraint whose want and whose delay is strew’d with sweets which they distil now in the curbed time to make the coming hour o’erflow with joy and pleasure drown the brim
that you will take your instant leave o’ the king and make this haste as your own good proceeding strengthen’d with what apology you think may make it probable need

yes my lord and of very valiant approof
you have it from his own deliverance
then my dial goes not true i took this lark for a bunting
i do assure you my lord he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant
i have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour and my state that way is dangerous since i cannot yet find in my heart to repent

is there any unkindness between my lord and you monsieur
i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord’s displeasure
you have made shift to run into ’t boots and spurs and all like him that leapt into the custard and out of it you’ll run again rather than suffer question for your residence
it may be you have mistaken him my lord
and shall do so ever though i took him at his prayers
fare you well my lord and believe this of me there can be no kernal in this light nut the soul of this man is his clothes trust him not in matter of heavy consequence i have kept of them tame and know their natures
farewell monsieur i have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand but we must do good against evil
why do you not know him
yes i do know him well and common speech gives him a worthy pass
i have sir as i was commanded from you spoke with the king and have procur’d his leave for present parting only he desires some private speech with you
you must not marvel helen at my course which holds not colour with the time nor does the ministration and required office on my particular
prepared i was not for such a business therefore am i found so much unsettled this drives me to entreat you that presently you take your way for home and rather muse than ask why i entreat you for my respects are better than they seem and my appointments have in them a need greater than shows itself at the first view to you that know them not

sir i can nothing say but that i am your most obedient servant
come come no more of that

i am not worthy of the wealth i owe nor dare i say ’tis mine and yet it is but like a timorous thief most fain would steal what law does vouch mine own
something and scarce so much nothing indeed
i would not tell you what i would my lord
faith yes strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss

i shall not break your bidding good my lord

holy seems the quarrel upon your grace’s part black and fearful on the opposer
therefore we marvel much our cousin france would in so just a business shut his bosom against our borrowing prayers
good my lord the reasons of our state i cannot yield but like a common and an outward man that the great figure of a council frames by self unable motion therefore dare not say what i think of it since i have found myself in my incertain grounds to fail as often as i guess’d
but i am sure the younger of our nature that surfeit on their ease will day by day come here for physic
welcome shall they be and all the honours that can fly from us shall on them settle

by my troth i take my young lord to be a very melancholy man
by what observance i pray you
why he will look upon his boot and sing mend the ruff and sing ask questions and sing pick his teeth and sing
i know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song
let me see what he writes and when he means to come
i have no mind to isbel since i was at court
our old lings and our isbels o’ th’ country are nothing like your old ling and your isbels o’ th’ court

this is not well rash and unbridled boy to fly the favours of so good a king to pluck his indignation on thy head by the misprizing of a maid too virtuous for the contempt of empire
o madam yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady
nay there is some comfort in the news some comfort your son will not be kill’d so soon as i thought he would
so say i madam if he run away as i hear he does the danger is in standing to’t that’s the loss of men though it be the getting of children
here they come will tell you more
for my part i only hear your son was run away

pray you gentlemen — i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief that the first face of neither on the start can woman me unto ’t
where is my son i pray you
madam he’s gone to serve the duke of florence we met him thitherward for thence we came and after some despatch in hand at court thither we bend again
look on this letter madam here’s my passport
reads when thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off and show me a child begotten of thy body that i am father to then call me husband but in such a “then” i write a “never” this is a dreadful sentence
ay madam and for the contents’ sake are sorry for our pains
i pr’ythee lady have a better cheer if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine thou robb’st me of a moiety
he was my son but i do wash his name out of my blood and thou art all my child
such is his noble purpose and believe’t the duke will lay upon him all the honour that good convenience claims
ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed
reads till i have no wife i have nothing in france ’tis bitter
’tis but the boldness of his hand haply which his heart was not consenting to
nothing in france until he have no wife
there’s nothing here that is too good for him but only she and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys might tend upon and call her hourly mistress
a servant only and a gentleman which i have sometime known
a very tainted fellow and full of wickedness
my son corrupts a well derived nature with his inducement
indeed good lady the fellow has a deal of that too much which holds him much to have
i will entreat you when you see my son to tell him that his sword can never win the honour that he loses more i’ll entreat you written to bear along
we serve you madam in that and all your worthiest affairs
not so but as we change our courtesies
“till i have no wife i have nothing in france ” nothing in france until he has no wife
thou shalt have none rossillon none in france then hast thou all again
poor lord is’t i that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the none sparing war
and is it i that drive thee from the sportive court where thou wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark of smoky muskets
o you leaden messengers that ride upon the violent speed of fire fly with false aim move the still peering air that sings with piercing do not touch my lord
whoever shoots at him i set him there whoever charges on his forward breast i am the caitiff that do hold him to’t and though i kill him not i am the cause his death was so effected
better ’twere i met the ravin lion when he roar’d with sharp constraint of hunger better ’twere that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once
no come thou home rossillon whence honour but of danger wins a scar as oft it loses all
i will be gone my being here it is that holds thee hence
shall i stay here to do’t
no no although the air of paradise did fan the house and angels offic’d all
i will be gone that pitiful rumour may report my flight to consolate thine ear
come night end day for with the dark poor thief i’ll steal away

write write that from the bloody course of war my dearest master your dear son may hie
bless him at home in peace whilst i from far his name with zealous fervour sanctify
his taken labours bid him me forgive i his despiteful juno sent him forth from courtly friends with camping foes to live where death and danger dog the heels of worth
he is too good and fair for death and me whom i myself embrace to set him free countess
ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
rynaldo you did never lack advice so much as letting her pass so had i spoke with her i could have well diverted her intents which thus she hath prevented
pardon me madam if i had given you this at over night she might have been o’erta’en and yet she writes pursuit would be but vain
what angel shall bless this unworthy husband
he cannot thrive unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice
write write rynaldo to this unworthy husband of his wife let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light my greatest grief though little he do feel it set down sharply
when haply he shall hear that she is gone he will return and hope i may that she hearing so much will speed her foot again led hither by pure love
which of them both is dearest to me i have no skill in sense to make distinction
my heart is heavy and mine age is weak grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak

a tucket afar off we have lost our labour they are gone a contrary way
you may know by their trumpets
come let’s return again and suffice ourselves with the report of it
well diana take heed of this french earl the honour of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as honesty
i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion
i know that knave hang him
one parolles a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl
beware of them diana their promises enticements oaths tokens and all these engines of lust are not the things they go under many a maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is example that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade succession but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them
i hope i need not to advise you further but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost
you shall not need to fear me
enter helena in the dress of a pilgrim
i know she will lie at my house thither they send one another i’ll question her
where do the palmers lodge i do beseech you
at the saint francis here beside the port
hark you they come this way
if you will tarry holy pilgrim but till the troops come by i will conduct you where you shall be lodg’d the rather for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself
if you shall please so pilgrim
i thank you and will stay upon your leisure
you came i think from france
here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service
but by the ear that hears most nobly of him his face i know not
whatsome’er he is he’s bravely taken here
he stole from france as ’tis reported for the king had married him against his liking
ay surely mere the truth i know his lady
there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her
o i believe with him in argument of praise or to the worth of the great count himself she is too mean to have her name repeated all her deserving is a reserved honesty and that i have not heard examin’d
’tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord
ay right good creature wheresoe’er she is her heart weighs sadly
this young maid might do her a shrewd turn if she pleas’d
maybe the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose
he does indeed and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid but she is arm’d for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence
enter with a drum and colours a party of the florentine army bertram and parolles
that is antonio the duke’s eldest son that escalus
he that with the plume ’tis a most gallant fellow
i would he lov’d his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier
’tis pity he is not honest
yond’s that same knave that leads him to these places
were i his lady i would poison that vile rascal
that jack an apes with scarfs
perchance he’s hurt i’ the battle
and your courtesy for a ring carrier
exeunt bertram parolles officers and soldiers widow
come pilgrim i will bring you where you shall host of enjoin’d penitents there’s four or five to great saint jaques bound already at my house
please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us tonight the charge and thanking shall be for me and to requite you further i will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note
enter bertram and the two french lords
nay good my lord put him to’t let him have his way
if your lordship find him not a hilding hold me no more in your respect
on my life my lord a bubble
do you think i am so far deceived in him
believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he’s a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s entertainment
it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you
i would i knew in what particular action to try him
none better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do
i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents
be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything
o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem for’t
when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not john drum’s entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
o for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand
this drum sticks sorely in your disposition
a pox on ’t let it go ’tis but a drum
there was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers
that was not to be blam’d in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command
well we cannot greatly condemn our success some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered
it might but it is not now
but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer i would have that drum or another or hic jacet
why if you have a stomach to’t monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness
by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it
but you must not now slumber in it
i’ll about it this evening and i will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me
may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it
i know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt i vow
i know th’art valiant and to the possibility of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee
no more than a fish loves water
is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damn’d than to do’t
you do not know him my lord as we do certain it is that he will steal himself into a man’s favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever after
why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto
none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall tonight for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect
we’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him
he was first smok’d by the old lord lafew when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very night
i must go look my twigs
your brother he shall go along with me
now will i lead you to the house and show you the lass i spoke of
i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her by this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind tokens and letters which she did re send and this is all i have done
she’s a fair creature will you go see her
with all my heart my lord
a room in the widow’s house
if you misdoubt me that i am not she i know not how i shall assure you further but i shall lose the grounds i work upon
though my estate be fall’n i was well born nothing acquainted with these businesses and would not put my reputation now in any staining act
first give me trust the count he is my husband and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word and then you cannot by the good aid that i of you shall borrow err in bestowing it
i should believe you for you have show’d me that which well approves y’are great in fortune
take this purse of gold and let me buy your friendly help thus far which i will over pay and pay again when i have found it
the count he woos your daughter lays down his wanton siege before her beauty resolv’d to carry her let her in fine consent as we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it
now his important blood will naught deny that she’ll demand a ring the county wears that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son some four or five descents since the first father wore it
this ring he holds in most rich choice yet in his idle fire to buy his will it would not seem too dear howe’er repented after
now i see the bottom of your purpose
you see it lawful then it is no more but that your daughter ere she seems as won desires this ring appoints him an encounter in fine delivers me to fill the time herself most chastely absent
after to marry her i’ll add three thousand crowns to what is pass’d already
instruct my daughter how she shall persever that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent
every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs compos’d to her unworthiness it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves for he persists as if his life lay on ’t
why then tonight let us assay our plot which if it speed is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act where both not sin and yet a sinful fact
enter first lord with five or six soldiers in ambush
he can come no other way but by this hedge corner
when you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless someone among us whom we must produce for an interpreter
good captain let me be th’ interpreter
but what linsey woolsey has thou to speak to us again
e’en such as you speak to me
he must think us some band of strangers i’ the adversary’s entertainment
now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose choughs’ language gabble enough and good enough
as for you interpreter you must seem very politic
here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges
within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home
what shall i say i have done
it must be a very plausive invention that carries it
they begin to smoke me and disgraces have of late knock’d too often at my door
i find my tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my tongue
aside this is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of
what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing i had no such purpose
i must give myself some hurts and say i got them in exploit yet slight ones will not carry it
they will say “came you off with so little ” and great ones i dare not give
tongue i must put you into a butter woman’s mouth and buy myself another of bajazet’s mule if you prattle me into these perils
aside is it possible he should know what he is and be that he is
i would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my spanish sword
aside we cannot afford you so
or the baring of my beard and to say it was in stratagem
or to drown my clothes and say i was stripped
though i swore i leap’d from the window of the citadel — first lord
aside three great oaths would scarce make that be believed
i would i had any drum of the enemy’s i would swear i recover’d it
aside you shall hear one anon
a drum now of the enemy’s
throca movousus cargo cargo cargo all
cargo cargo cargo villianda par corbo cargo they seize and blindfold him parolles
i know you are the muskos’ regiment and i shall lose my life for want of language
if there be here german or dane low dutch italian or french let him speak to me i’ll discover that which shall undo the florentine
boskos vauvado i understand thee and can speak thy tongue
kerelybonto sir betake thee to thy faith for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom
the general is content to spare thee yet and hoodwink’d as thou art will lead thee on to gather from thee
haply thou mayst inform something to save thy life
o let me live and all the secrets of our camp i’ll show their force their purposes nay i’ll speak that which you will wonder at
if i do not damn me
acordo linta come on thou art granted space
exit with parolles guarded a short alarum within
go tell the count rossillon and my brother we have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled till we do hear from them
’a will betray us all unto ourselves inform on that
till then i’ll keep him dark and safely lock’d
a room in the widow’s house
they told me that your name was fontybell
titled goddess and worth it with addition
but fair soul in your fine frame hath love no quality
if the quick fire of youth light not your mind you are no maiden but a monument when you are dead you should be such a one as you are now for you are cold and stern and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got
my mother did but duty such my lord as you owe to your wife
i pr’ythee do not strive against my vows i was compell’d to her but i love thee by love’s own sweet constraint and will for ever do thee all rights of service
ay so you serve us till we serve you but when you have our roses you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness
’tis not the many oaths that makes the truth but the plain single vow that is vow’d true
what is not holy that we swear not by but take the highest to witness then pray you tell me if i should swear by jove’s great attributes i lov’d you dearly would you believe my oaths when i did love you ill
this has no holding to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him
therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions but unseal’d — at least in my opinion
love is holy and my integrity ne’er knew the crafts that you do charge men with
stand no more off but give thyself unto my sick desires who then recovers
say thou art mine and ever my love as it begins shall so persever
i see that men make hopes in such a case that we’ll forsake ourselves
i’ll lend it thee my dear but have no power to give it from me
it is an honour ’longing to our house bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world in me to lose
mine honour’s such a ring my chastity’s the jewel of our house bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i’ the world in me to lose
thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part against your vain assault
here take my ring my house mine honour yea my life be thine and i’ll be bid by thee
when midnight comes knock at my chamber window i’ll order take my mother shall not hear
now will i charge you in the band of truth when you have conquer’d my yet maiden bed remain there but an hour nor speak to me
my reasons are most strong and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver’d and on your finger in the night i’ll put another ring that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds
adieu till then then fail not
you have won a wife of me though there my hope be done
a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee
for which live long to thank both heaven and me
you may so in the end
my mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat in’s heart
she says all men have the like oaths
he had sworn to marry me when his wife’s dead therefore i’ll lie with him when i am buried
since frenchmen are so braid marry that will i live and die a maid
only in this disguise i think’t no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win
enter the two french lords and two or three soldiers
you have not given him his mother’s letter
i have deliv’red it an hour since there is something in’t that stings his nature for on the reading it he chang’d almost into another man
he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady
especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tun’d his bounty to sing happiness to him
i will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you
when you have spoken it ’tis dead and i am the grave of it
he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition
as we are ourselves what things are we
and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr’d ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o’erflows himself
is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents
we shall not then have his company tonight
not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
i would gladly have him see his company anatomized that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit
we will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the other
in the meantime what hear you of these wars
i hear there is an overture of peace
nay i assure you a peace concluded
what will count rossillon do then
will he travel higher or return again into france
i perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his council
so should i be a great deal of his act
sir his wife some two months since fled from his house
her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven
the stronger part of it by her own letters which makes her story true even to the point of her death
her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirm’d by the rector of the place
hath the count all this intelligence
ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity
i am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this
how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses
and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears
the great dignity that his valour hath here acquir’d for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample
the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish’d by our virtues
he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave his lordship will next morning for france
the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king
they shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commend
they cannot be too sweet for the king’s tartness
how now my lord is’t not after midnight
i have tonight despatch’d sixteen businesses a month’s length apiece by an abstract of success i have congied with the duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourn’d for her writ to my lady mother i am returning entertained my convoy and between these main parcels of despatch effected many nicer needs the last was the greatest but that i have not ended yet
if the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship
i mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter
but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier
come bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv’d me like a double meaning prophesier
exeunt soldiers has sat i’ the stocks all night poor gallant knave
no matter his heels have deserv’d it in usurping his spurs so long
i have told your lordship already the stocks carry him
but to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the stocks
and what think you he hath confessed
his confession is taken and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be in’t as i believe you are you must have the patience to hear it
he can say nothing of me hush hush
what will you say without ’em
i will confess what i know without constraint
if ye pinch me like a pasty i can say no more
our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note
and truly as i hope to live
‘first demand of him how many horse the duke is strong ’ what say you to that
five or six thousand but very weak and unserviceable the troops are all scattered and the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation and credit and as i hope to live
shall i set down your answer so
i’ll take the sacrament on ’t how and which way you will
what a past saving slave is this
you are deceived my lord this is monsieur parolles the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the chape of his dagger
i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly
‘five or six thousand horse’ i said—i will say true—or thereabouts set down —for i’ll speak truth
he’s very near the truth in this
but i con him no thanks for’t in the nature he delivers it
poor rogues i pray you say
i humbly thank you sir a truth’s a truth the rogues are marvellous poor
‘demand of him of what strength they are a foot ’ what say you to that
by my troth sir if i were to live this present hour i will tell true
let me see spurio a hundred and fifty sebastian so many corambus so many jaques so many guiltian cosmo lodowick and gratii two hundred fifty each mine own company chitopher vaumond bentii two hundred fifty each so that the muster file rotten and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
what shall be done to him
nothing but let him have thanks
demand of him my condition and what credit i have with the duke
‘you shall demand of him whether one captain dumaine be i’ the camp a frenchman what his reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty and expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with well weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt ’ what say you to this
what do you know of it
i beseech you let me answer to the particular of the inter’gatories
do you know this captain dumaine
i know him he was a botcher’s ’prentice in paris from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve’s fool with child a dumb innocent that could not say him nay
first lord lifts up his hand in anger bertram
nay by your leave hold your hands though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
well is this captain in the duke of florence’s camp
upon my knowledge he is and lousy
nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your lordship anon
what is his reputation with the duke
the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o’ the band
i think i have his letter in my pocket
in good sadness i do not know either it is there or it is upon a file with the duke’s other letters in my tent
here ’tis here’s a paper shall i read it to you
i do not know if it be it or no
reads dian the count’s a fool and full of gold parolles
that is not the duke’s letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence one diana to take heed of the allurement of one count rossillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish
i pray you sir put it up again
nay i’ll read it first by your favour
my meaning in’t i protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds
reads when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it after he scores he never pays the score
half won is match well made match and well make it he ne’er pays after debts take it before
and say a soldier ‘dian ’ told thee this men are to mell with boys are not to kiss for count of this the count’s a fool i know it who pays before but not when he does owe it
thine as he vow’d to thee in thine ear parolles
he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in’s forehead
this is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier
i could endure anything before but a cat and now he’s a cat to me
i perceive sir by our general’s looks we shall be fain to hang you
my life sir in any case
not that i am afraid to die but that my offences being many i would repent out the remainder of nature
let me live sir in a dungeon i’ the stocks or anywhere so i may live
we’ll see what may be done so you confess freely
therefore once more to this captain dumaine you have answer’d to his reputation with the duke and to his valour
he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus
he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking them he is stronger than hercules
he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine drunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw
i have but little more to say sir of his honesty he has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing
i begin to love him for this
for this description of thine honesty
a pox upon him for me he’s more and more a cat
what say you to his expertness in war
faith sir has led the drum before the english tragedians —to belie him i will not —and more of his soldiership i know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile end to instruct for the doubling of files
i would do the man what honour i can but of this i am not certain
he hath out villain’d villainy so far that the rarity redeems him
his qualities being at this poor price i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
sir for a quart d’ecu he will sell the fee simple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut the entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually
what’s his brother the other captain dumaine
why does he ask him of me
e’en a crow o’ the same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil
he excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is
in a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming on he has the cramp
if your life be saved will you undertake to betray the florentine
ay and the captain of his horse count rossillon
i’ll whisper with the general and know his pleasure
aside i’ll no more drumming a plague of all drums
only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count have i run into this danger yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken
there is no remedy sir but you must die
the general says you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die
come headsman off with his head
sir let me live or let me see my death
that shall you and take your leave of all your friends
unmuffling him so look about you know you any here
captain what greeting will you to my lord lafew
good captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to diana in behalf of the count rossillon
and i were not a very coward i’d compel it of you but fare you well
exeunt bertram lords c first soldier
you are undone captain all but your scarf that has a knot on’t yet
who cannot be crushed with a plot
if you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame you might begin an impudent nation
i am for france too we shall speak of you there
if my heart were great ’twould burst at this
captain i’ll be no more but i will eat and drink and sleep as soft as captain shall
simply the thing i am shall make me live
who knows himself a braggart let him fear this for it will come to pass that every braggart shall be found an ass
rust sword cool blushes and parolles live safest in shame being fool’d by foolery thrive
there’s place and means for every man alive
a room in the widow’s house
that you may well perceive i have not wrong’d you one of the greatest in the christian world shall be my surety fore whose throne ’tis needful ere i can perfect mine intents to kneel
time was i did him a desired office dear almost as his life which gratitude through flinty tartar’s bosom would peep forth and answer thanks
i duly am inform’d his grace is at marseilles to which place we have convenient convoy
you must know i am supposed dead
the army breaking my husband hies him home where heaven aiding and by the leave of my good lord the king we’ll be before our welcome
gentle madam you never had a servant to whose trust your business was more welcome
nor you mistress ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour to recompense your love
doubt not but heaven hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower as it hath fated her to be my motive and helper to a husband
that can such sweet use make of what they hate when saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts defiles the pitchy night so lust doth play with what it loathes for that which is away
you diana under my poor instructions yet must suffer something in my behalf
let death and honesty go with your impositions i am yours upon your will to suffer
yet i pray you but with the word the time will bring on summer when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns and be as sweet as sharp
we must away our waggon is prepar’d and time revives us
all’s well that ends well still the fine’s the crown
whate’er the course the end is the renown
a room in the countess’s palace
no no no your son was misled with a snipt taffeta fellow there whose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak’d and doughy youth of a nation in his colour
your daughter in law had been alive at this hour and your son here at home more advanc’d by the king than by that red tail’d humble bee i speak of
i would i had not known him it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating
if she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother i could not have owed her a more rooted love
’twas a good lady ’twas a good lady
we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb
indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the salad or rather the herb of grace
they are not herbs you knave they are nose herbs
i am no great nebuchadnezzar sir i have not much skill in grass
whether dost thou profess thyself —a knave or a fool
a fool sir at a woman’s service and a knave at a man’s
i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service
so you were a knave at his service indeed
and i would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service
i will subscribe for thee thou art both knave and fool
why sir if i cannot serve you i can serve as great a prince as you are
faith sir ’a has an english name but his phisnomy is more hotter in france than there
the black prince sir alias the prince of darkness alias the devil
i give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talk’st of serve him still
i am a woodland fellow sir that always loved a great fire and the master i speak of ever keeps a good fire
but sure he is the prince of the world let his nobility remain in’s court
i am for the house with the narrow gate which i take to be too little for pomp to enter some that humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender and they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire
go thy ways i begin to be a weary of thee and i tell thee so before because i would not fall out with thee
go thy ways let my horses be well look’d to without any tricks
if i put any tricks upon ’em sir they shall be jades’ tricks which are their own right by the law of nature
a shrewd knave and an unhappy
my lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him by his authority he remains here which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness and indeed he has no pace but runs where he will
i like him well ’tis not amiss
and i was about to tell you since i heard of the good lady’s death and that my lord your son was upon his return home i moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter which in the minority of them both his majesty out of a self gracious remembrance did first propose
his highness hath promis’d me to do it and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son there is no fitter matter
how does your ladyship like it
with very much content my lord and i wish it happily effected
his highness comes post from marseilles of as able body as when he number’d thirty he will be here tomorrow or i am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail’d
it rejoices me that i hope i shall see him ere i die
i have letters that my son will be here tonight
i shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together
madam i was thinking with what manners i might safely be admitted
you need but plead your honourable privilege
lady of that i have made a bold charter but i thank my god it holds yet
o madam yonder’s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on’s face whether there be a scar under’t or no the velvet knows but ’tis a goodly patch of velvet
his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half but his right cheek is worn bare
a scar nobly got or a noble scar is a good livery of honour so belike is that
but it is your carbonado’d face
let us go see your son i pray you
i long to talk with the young noble soldier
faith there’s a dozen of ’em with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head and nod at every man

but since you have made the days and nights as one to wear your gentle limbs in my affairs be bold you do so grow in my requital as nothing can unroot you
in happy time — enter a gentleman
this man may help me to his majesty’s ear if he would spend his power
sir i have seen you in the court of france
i do presume sir that you are not fallen from the report that goes upon your goodness and therefore goaded with most sharp occasions which lay nice manners by i put you to the use of your own virtues for the which i shall continue thankful
that it will please you to give this poor petition to the king and aid me with that store of power you have to come into his presence
he hence remov’d last night and with more haste than is his use
lord how we lose our pains
all’s well that ends well yet though time seem so adverse and means unfit
i do beseech you whither is he gone
marry as i take it to rossillon whither i am going
i do beseech you sir since you are like to see the king before me commend the paper to his gracious hand which i presume shall render you no blame but rather make you thank your pains for it
i will come after you with what good speed our means will make us means
and you shall find yourself to be well thank’d whate’er falls more
the inner court of the countess’s palace
good monsieur lavache give my lord lafew this letter i have ere now sir been better known to you when i have held familiarity with fresher clothes but i am now sir muddied in fortune’s mood and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure
truly fortune’s displeasure is but sluttish if it smell so strongly as thou speak’st of
i will henceforth eat no fish of fortune’s buttering
nay you need not to stop your nose sir
i spake but by a metaphor
indeed sir if your metaphor stink i will stop my nose or against any man’s metaphor
pray you sir deliver me this paper
a paper from fortune’s close stool to give to a nobleman
here is a pur of fortune’s sir or of fortune’s cat but not a musk cat that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure and as he says is muddied withal
pray you sir use the carp as you may for he looks like a poor decayed ingenious foolish rascally knave
i do pity his distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to your lordship
my lord i am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratch’d
and what would you have me to do
’tis too late to pare her nails now
wherein have you played the knave with fortune that she should scratch you who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her
there’s a quart d’ecu for you
let the justices make you and fortune friends i am for other business
i beseech your honour to hear me one single word
you beg a single penny more
come you shall ha’t save your word
my name my good lord is parolles
you beg more than word then
o my good lord you were the first that found me
and i was the first that lost thee
it lies in you my lord to bring me in some grace for you did bring me out
dost thou put upon me at once both the office of god and the devil
one brings the in grace and the other brings thee out
trumpets sound the king’s coming i know by his trumpets
i had talk of you last night though you are a fool and a knave you shall eat
a room in the countess’s palace
enter king countess lafew lords gentlemen guards c king
we lost a jewel of her and our esteem was made much poorer by it but your son as mad in folly lack’d the sense to know her estimation home
’tis past my liege and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion done i’ the blaze of youth when oil and fire too strong for reason’s force o’erbears it and burns on
my honour’d lady i have forgiven and forgotten all though my revenges were high bent upon him and watch’d the time to shoot
this i must say — but first i beg my pardon —the young lord did to his majesty his mother and his lady offence of mighty note but to himself the greatest wrong of all
he lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive whose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve humbly call’d mistress
praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear
well call him hither we are reconcil’d and the first view shall kill all repetition
let him not ask our pardon the nature of his great offence is dead and deeper than oblivion do we bury th’ incensing relics of it
let him approach a stranger no offender and inform him so ’tis our will he should
what says he to your daughter
all that he is hath reference to your highness
then shall we have a match
i have letters sent me that sets him high in fame
i am not a day of season for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once
but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth the time is fair again
my high repented blames dear sovereign pardon to me
not one word more of the consumed time
let’s take the instant by the forward top for we are old and on our quick’st decrees th’inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them
you remember the daughter of this lord
at first i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart durst make too bold herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing contempt his scornful perspective did lend me which warp’d the line of every other favour scorn’d a fair colour or express’d it stolen extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object
thence it came that she whom all men prais’d and whom myself since i have lost have lov’d was in mine eye the dust that did offend it
well excus’d that thou didst love her strikes some scores away from the great compt but love that comes too late like a remorseful pardon slowly carried to the great sender turns a sour offence crying that’s good that’s gone
our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have not knowing them until we know their grave
oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what’s done while shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon
be this sweet helen’s knell and now forget her
send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin
the main consents are had and here we’ll stay to see our widower’s second marriage day
which better than the first o dear heaven bless
or ere they meet in me o nature cesse
come on my son in whom my house’s name must be digested give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter that she may quickly come
bertram gives a ring to lafew by my old beard and ev’ry hair that’s on ’t helen that’s dead was a sweet creature such a ring as this the last that e’er i took her leave at court i saw upon her finger
now pray you let me see it for mine eye while i was speaking oft was fasten’d to it
this ring was mine and when i gave it helen i bade her if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help that by this token i would relieve her
had you that craft to ’reave her of what should stead her most
my gracious sovereign howe’er it pleases you to take it so the ring was never hers
son on my life i have seen her wear it and she reckon’d it at her life’s rate
i am sure i saw her wear it
you are deceiv’d my lord she never saw it
in florence was it from a casement thrown me wrapp’d in a paper which contain’d the name of her that threw it
noble she was and thought i stood engag’d but when i had subscrib’d to mine own fortune and inform’d her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture she ceas’d in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again
plutus himself that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine hath not in nature’s mystery more science than i have in this ring
’twas mine ’twas helen’s whoever gave it you
then if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself confess ’twas hers and by what rough enforcement you got it from her
she call’d the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger unless she gave it to yourself in bed where you have never come or sent it us upon her great disaster
thou speak’st it falsely as i love mine honour and mak’st conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out
if it should prove that thou art so inhuman —’twill not prove so and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly
and she is dead which nothing but to close her eyes myself could win me to believe more than to see this ring
guards seize bertram my fore past proofs howe’er the matter fall shall tax my fears of little vanity having vainly fear’d too little
if you shall prove this ring was ever hers you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence where she yet never was
i am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings
gracious sovereign whether i have been to blame or no i know not here’s a petition from a florentine who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself
i undertook it vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant who by this i know is here attending her business looks in her with an importing visage and she told me in a sweet verbal brief it did concern your highness with herself
reads upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won me
now is the count rossillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my honour’s paid to him
he stole from florence taking no leave and i follow him to his country for justice
grant it me o king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone diana capilet
i will buy me a son in law in a fair and toll for this
the heavens have thought well on thee lafew to bring forth this discovery
go speedily and bring again the count
exeunt gentleman and some attendants i am afeard the life of helen lady was foully snatch’d
i wonder sir since wives are monsters to you and that you fly them as you swear them lordship yet you desire to marry
i am my lord a wretched florentine derived from the ancient capilet my suit as i do understand you know and therefore know how far i may be pitied
i am her mother sir whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring and both shall cease without your remedy
come hither count do you know these women
my lord i neither can nor will deny but that i know them
why do you look so strange upon your wife
she’s none of mine my lord
if you shall marry you give away this hand and that is mine you give away heaven’s vows and those are mine you give away myself which is known mine for i by vow am so embodied yours that she which marries you must marry me either both or none
to bertram your reputation comes too short for my daughter you are no husband for her
my lord this is a fond and desperate creature whom sometime i have laugh’d with
let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here
sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies
good my lord ask him upon his oath if he does think he had not my virginity
she’s impudent my lord and was a common gamester to the camp
he does me wrong my lord if i were so he might have bought me at a common price
o behold this ring whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o’ the camp if i be one
of six preceding ancestors that gem conferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue hath it been owed and worn
this is his wife that ring’s a thousand proofs
methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it
i did my lord but loath am to produce so bad an instrument his name’s parolles
i saw the man today if man he be
find him and bring him hither
he’s quoted for a most perfidious slave with all the spots o’ the world tax’d and debauch’d whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
am i or that or this for what he’ll utter that will speak anything
she hath that ring of yours
certain it is i lik’d her and boarded her i’ the wanton way of youth
she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancy’s course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdu’d me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at market price have bought
you that have turn’d off a first so noble wife may justly diet me
i pray you yet — since you lack virtue i will lose a husband— send for your ring i will return it home and give me mine again
what ring was yours i pray you
sir much like the same upon your finger
this ring was his of late
and this was it i gave him being abed
the story then goes false you threw it him out of a casement
my lord i do confess the ring was hers
you boggle shrewdly every feather starts you
is this the man you speak of
tell me sirrah but tell me true i charge you not fearing the displeasure of your master which on your just proceeding i’ll keep off — by him and by this woman here what know you
so please your majesty my master hath been an honourable gentleman
tricks he hath had in him which gentlemen have
faith sir he did love her but how
he did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman
he lov’d her sir and lov’d her not
as thou art a knave and no knave
what an equivocal companion is this
i am a poor man and at your majesty’s command
he’s a good drum my lord but a naughty orator
do you know he promised me marriage
faith i know more than i’ll speak
but wilt thou not speak all thou know’st
i did go between them as i said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for her and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not speak what i know
thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside
this ring you say was yours
it was not given me nor i did not buy it
it was not lent me neither
where did you find it then
if it were yours by none of all these ways how could you give it him
this woman’s an easy glove my lord she goes off and on at pleasure
this ring was mine i gave it his first wife
it might be yours or hers for ought i know
take her away i do not like her now
unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring thou diest within this hour
i’ll put in bail my liege
i think thee now some common customer
by jove if ever i knew man ’twas you
wherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while
because he’s guilty and he is not guilty
he knows i am no maid and he’ll swear to’t i’ll swear i am a maid and he knows not
great king i am no strumpet by my life i am either maid or else this old man’s wife
she does abuse our ears to prison with her
stay royal sir exit widow the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for and he shall surety me
but for this lord who hath abus’d me as he knows himself though yet he never harm’d me here i quit him
he knows himself my bed he hath defil’d and at that time he got his wife with child
dead though she be she feels her young one kick so there’s my riddle one that’s dead is quick and now behold the meaning
is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
no my good lord ’tis but the shadow of a wife you see the name and not the thing
o my good lord when i was like this maid i found you wondrous kind
there is your ring and look you here’s your letter
this it says ‘when from my finger you can get this ring and is by me with child c ’ this is done will you be mine now you are doubly won
if she my liege can make me know this clearly i’ll love her dearly ever ever dearly
if it appear not plain and prove untrue deadly divorce step between me and you
o my dear mother do i see you living
mine eyes smell onions i shall weep anon
to parolles good tom drum lend me a handkercher
wait on me home i’ll make sport with thee
let thy courtesies alone they are scurvy ones
let us from point to point this story know to make the even truth in pleasure flow
to diana if thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower choose thou thy husband and i’ll pay thy dower for i can guess that by thy honest aid thou kept’st a wife herself thyself a maid
of that and all the progress more and less resolvedly more leisure shall express
all yet seems well and if it end so meet the bitter past more welcome is the sweet
flourish epilogue the king’s a beggar now the play is done all is well ended if this suit be won that you express content which we will pay with strife to please you day exceeding day

news my good lord from rome
fulvia perchance is angry or who knows if the scarce bearded caesar have not sent his powerful mandate to you “do this or this take in that kingdom and enfranchise that
perform’t or else we damn thee ” antony
you must not stay here longer your dismission is come from caesar therefore hear it antony
where’s fulvia’s process —caesar’s i would say
as i am egypt’s queen thou blushest antony and that blood of thine is caesar’s homager else so thy cheek pays shame when shrill tongued fulvia scolds
let rome in tiber melt and the wide arch of the ranged empire fall
our dungy earth alike feeds beast as man
the nobleness of life is to do thus embracing when such a mutual pair and such a twain can do’t in which i bind on pain of punishment the world to weet we stand up peerless
why did he marry fulvia and not love her
i’ll seem the fool i am not
now for the love of love and her soft hours let’s not confound the time with conference harsh
there’s not a minute of our lives should stretch without some pleasure now
whom everything becomes—to chide to laugh to weep whose every passion fully strives to make itself in thee fair and admired

bring in the banquet quickly wine enough cleopatra’s health to drink
good sir give me good fortune
you shall be yet far fairer than you are
no you shall paint when you are old
you shall be more beloving than beloved
i had rather heat my liver with drinking
let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all
let me have a child at fifty to whom herod of jewry may do homage
find me to marry me with octavius caesar and companion me with my mistress
you shall outlive the lady whom you serve
i love long life better than figs
you have seen and proved a fairer former fortune than that which is to approach
then belike my children shall have no names
prithee how many boys and wenches must i have
if every of your wishes had a womb and fertile every wish a million
i forgive thee for a witch
you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes
mine and most of our fortunes tonight shall be drunk to bed
there’s a palm presages chastity if nothing else

for as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose wived so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded
therefore dear isis keep decorum and fortune him accordingly

speak to me home mince not the general tongue

in sicyon her length of sickness with what else more serious importeth thee to know this bears
exit third messenger there’s a great spirit gone
what our contempts doth often hurl from us we wish it ours again
the present pleasure by revolution lowering does become the opposite of itself
the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on
i must from this enchanting queen break off
ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness doth hatch
i must with haste from hence
why then we kill all our women
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them
if they suffer our departure death’s the word
under a compelling occasion let women die
it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing
cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly
i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment
i do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying
she is cunning past man’s thought
alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love
we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report
this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a shower of rain as well as jove
would i had never seen her
o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel
why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice
when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new
if there were no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented
this grief is crowned with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
the business she hath broached in the state cannot endure my absence
and the business you have broached here cannot be without you especially that of cleopatra’s which wholly depends on your abode
let our officers have notice what we purpose
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part
for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home
sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea

much is breeding which like the courser’s hair hath yet but life and not a serpent’s poison

see where he is who’s with him what he does
if you find him sad say i am dancing if in mirth report that i am sudden sick
madam methinks if you did love him dearly you do not hold the method to enforce the like from him
what should i do i do not
in each thing give him way cross him in nothing
thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
tempt him not so too far i wish forbear
in time we hate that which we often fear
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— cleopatra
it cannot be thus long the sides of nature will not sustain it
pray you stand farther from me
i know by that same eye there’s some good news
what says the married woman you may go
would she had never given you leave to come
let her not say ’tis i that keep you here
i have no power upon you hers you are
o never was there queen so mightily betrayed
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted
why should i think you can be mine and true though you in swearing shake the throned gods who have been false to fulvia
riotous madness to be entangled with those mouth made vows which break themselves in swearing
nay pray you seek no colour for your going but bid farewell and go
when you sued staying then was the time for words
no going then eternity was in our lips and eyes bliss in our brows’ bent none our parts so poor but was a race of heaven
they are so still or thou the greatest soldier of the world art turned the greatest liar
i would i had thy inches thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt
hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you
our italy shines o’er with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love the condemned pompey rich in his father’s honour creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change
my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvia’s death
though age from folly could not give me freedom it does from childishness
look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked at the last best see when and where she died
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water
now i see i see in fulvia’s death how mine received shall be
quarrel no more but be prepared to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th’ advice
by the fire that quickens nilus’ slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects

good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look like perfect honour
you can do better yet but this is meetly
but this is not the best

sir you and i must part but that’s not it sir you and i have loved but there’s not it that you know well
something it is i would— o my oblivion is a very antony and i am all forgotten
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself
’tis sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this
but sir forgive me since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you
your honour calls you hence therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly and all the gods go with you
upon your sword sit laurel victory and smooth success be strewed before your feet
our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee
enter octavius caesar lepidus and their train
you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesar’s natural vice to hate our great competitor
from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafed to think he had partners
you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow
i must not think there are evils enough to darken all his goodness
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by night’s blackness hereditary rather than purchased what he cannot change than what he chooses
let’s grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat
say this becomes him— as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish—yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness
if he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for’t
but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours ’tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment
thy biddings have been done and every hour most noble caesar shalt thou have report how ’tis abroad
pompey is strong at sea and it appears he is beloved of those that only have feared caesar
to the ports the discontents repair and men’s reports give him much wronged
i should have known no less
it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were and the ebbed man ne’er loved till ne’er worth love comes deared by being lacked
this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion

many hot inroads they make in italy—the borders maritime lack blood to think on’t—and flush youth revolt
no vessel can peep forth but ’tis as soon taken as seen for pompey’s name strikes more than could his war resisted
when thou once was beaten from modena where thou slew’st hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou fought’st against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer
thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at
thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge
yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsed
on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on
and all this— it wounds thine honour that i speak it now— was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lanked not
let his shames quickly drive him to rome
’tis time we twain did show ourselves i’ th’ field and to that end assemble we immediate council
tomorrow caesar i shall be furnished to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time
till which encounter it is my business too
what you shall know meantime of stirs abroad i shall beseech you sir to let me be partaker
i knew it for my bond
enter cleopatra charmian iras and mardian
that i might sleep out this great gap of time my antony is away
you think of him too much
not now to hear thee sing
i take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has
’tis well for thee that being unseminared thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of egypt
not in deed madam for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done
yet have i fierce affections and think what venus did with mars
o charmian where think’st thou he is now
or is he on his horse
o happy horse to bear the weight of antony
do bravely horse for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st
the demi atlas of this earth the arm and burgonet of men
he’s speaking now or murmuring “where’s my serpent of old nile ” for so he calls me
now i feed myself with most delicious poison
think on me that am with phœbus’ amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time
broad fronted caesar when thou wast here above the ground i was a morsel for a monarch
and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life
how much unlike art thou mark antony
yet coming from him that great medicine hath with his tinct gilded thee
how goes it with my brave mark antony
last thing he did dear queen he kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— this orient pearl
his speech sticks in my heart
mine ear must pluck it thence
“good friend ” quoth he “say the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster at whose foot to mend the petty present i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms
all the east say thou shall call her mistress ” so he nodded and soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed who neighed so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbed by him
what was he sad or merry
like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
o well divided disposition —note him note him good charmian ’tis the man but note him he was not sad for he would shine on those that make their looks by his he was not merry which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy but between both
o heavenly mingle —be’st thou sad or merry the violence of either thee becomes so does it no man else —met’st thou my posts
why do you send so thick
who’s born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar —ink and paper charmian — welcome my good alexas —did i charmian ever love caesar so
be choked with such another emphasis
say “the brave antony ” charmian
by isis i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men
by your most gracious pardon i sing but after you
my salad days when i was green in judgment cold in blood to say as i said then
but come away get me ink and paper
he shall have every day a several greeting or i’ll unpeople egypt
exeunt act ii scene i messina
enter pompey menecrates and menas in warlike manner
if the great gods be just they shall assist the deeds of justest men
know worthy pompey that what they do delay they not deny
whiles we are suitors to their throne decays the thing we sue for
we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good so find we profit by losing of our prayers
the people love me and the sea is mine my powers are crescent and my auguring hope says it will come to th’ full
mark antony in egypt sits at dinner and will make no wars without doors
caesar gets money where he loses hearts
lepidus flatters both of both is flattered but he neither loves nor either cares for him
caesar and lepidus are in the field
i know they are in rome together looking for antony
but all the charms of love salt cleopatra soften thy waned lip
let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both tie up the libertine in a field of feasts keep his brain fuming
epicurean cooks sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour even till a lethe’d dullness— enter varrius
this is most certain that i shall deliver mark antony is every hour in rome expected
since he went from egypt ’tis a space for farther travel
i could have given less matter a better ear —menas i did not think this amorous surfeiter would have donned his helm for such a petty war
his soldiership is twice the other twain
but let us rear the higher our opinion that our stirring can from the lap of egypt’s widow pluck the ne’er lust wearied antony
i cannot hope caesar and antony shall well greet together
his wife that’s dead did trespasses to caesar his brother warred upon him although i think not moved by antony
i know not menas how lesser enmities may give way to greater
were’t not that we stand up against them all ’twere pregnant they should square between themselves for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords
but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference we yet not know
be’t as our gods will have’t
it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands
a room in the house of lepidus
good enobarbus ’tis a worthy deed and shall become you well to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech
i shall entreat him to answer like himself
if caesar move him let antony look over caesar’s head and speak as loud as mars
by jupiter were i the wearer of antonius’ beard i would not shave’t today
’tis not a time for private stomaching
every time serves for the matter that is then born in’t
but small to greater matters must give way
not if the small come first
your speech is passion but pray you stir no embers up
if we compose well here to parthia
noble friends that which combined us was most great and let not a leaner action rend us
what’s amiss may it be gently heard
when we debate our trivial difference loud we do commit murder in healing wounds
then noble partners the rather for i earnestly beseech touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms nor curstness grow to th’ matter
were we before our armies and to fight i should do thus
i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not
i must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little i should say myself offended and with you chiefly i’ th’ world more laughed at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concerned me
my being in egypt caesar what was’t to you
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt
yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me
your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war
my brother never did urge me in his act
i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you
did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause
of this my letters before did satisfy you
if you’ll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patched up your excuses
i know you could not lack—i am certain on’t— very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace
as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another
the third o’ th’ world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife
would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women
so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience—which not wanted shrewdness of policy too—i grieving grant did you too much disquiet
for that you must but say i could not help it
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience
sir he fell upon me ere admitted then
three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i’ th’ morning
but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have asked him pardon
let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him
you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with
the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lacked it
but on caesar the article of my oath
to lend me arms and aid when i required them the which you both denied
neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge
as nearly as i may i’ll play the penitent to you
but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it
truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you
or if you borrow one another’s love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again
you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot
you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech for’t cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so differing in their acts
yet if i knew what hoop should hold us staunch from edge to edge o’ th’ world i would pursue it
thou hast a sister by the mother’s side admired octavia
great mark antony is now a widower
if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deserved of rashness
let me hear agrippa further speak
to hold you in perpetual amity to make you brothers and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot take antony octavia to his wife whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter
by this marriage all little jealousies which now seem great and all great fears which now import their dangers would then be nothing
truths would be tales where now half tales be truths
her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her
pardon what i have spoke for ’tis a studied not a present thought by duty ruminated
not till he hears how antony is touched with what is spoke already
what power is in agrippa if i would say “agrippa be it so ” to make this good
the power of caesar and his power unto octavia
may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment
further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly
let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again
i did not think to draw my sword ’gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me
i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him
of us must pompey presently be sought or else he seeks out us
what is his strength by land
great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master
yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talked of
with most gladness and do invite you to my sister’s view whither straight i’ll lead you
let us lepidus not lack your company
noble antony not sickness should detain me
exeunt all except enobarbus agrippa and maecenas maecenas
half the heart of caesar worthy maecenas
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested
you stayed well by ’t in egypt
ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking
eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there
this was but as a fly by an eagle
we had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
she’s a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
when she first met mark antony she pursed up his heart upon the river of cydnus
there she appeared indeed or my reporter devised well for her
the barge she sat in like a burnished throne burned on the water
the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were love sick with them the oars were silver which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes
for her own person it beggared all description she did lie in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue o’erpicturing that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature
on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with divers coloured fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did
her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i’ th’ eyes and made their bends adornings
at the helm a seeming mermaid steers
the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flower soft hands that yarely frame the office
from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs
the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthroned i’ th’ market place did sit alone whistling to th’ air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature
upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper
she replied it should be better he became her guest which she entreated
our courteous antony whom ne’er the word of “no” woman heard speak being barbered ten times o’er goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed
he ploughed her and she cropped
i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless pour breath forth
now antony must leave her utterly
age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety
other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies
for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish
if beauty wisdom modesty can settle the heart of antony octavia is a blessed lottery to him
good enobarbus make yourself my guest whilst you abide here
enter antony caesar octavia between them
the world and my great office will sometimes divide me from your bosom
all which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you
good night sir —my octavia read not my blemishes in the world’s report
i have not kept my square but that to come shall all be done by th’ rule
exeunt caesar and octavia enter soothsayer
now sirrah you do wish yourself in egypt
would i had never come from thence nor you thither
i see it in my motion have it not in my tongue
but yet hie you to egypt again
say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher caesar’s or mine
therefore o antony stay not by his side
thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is noble courageous high unmatchable where caesar’s is not
but near him thy angel becomes afeard as being o’erpowered
therefore make space enough between you
to none but thee no more but when to thee
if thou dost play with him at any game thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck he beats thee ’gainst the odds
thy lustre thickens when he shines by
i say again thy spirit is all afraid to govern thee near him but he away ’tis noble
say to ventidius i would speak with him
exit soothsayer he shall to parthia
be it art or hap he hath spoken true
the very dice obey him and in our sports my better cunning faints under his chance
if we draw lots he speeds his cocks do win the battle still of mine when it is all to naught and his quails ever beat mine inhooped at odds
i will to egypt and though i make this marriage for my peace i’ th’ east my pleasure lies
o come ventidius you must to parthia
pray you hasten your generals after
sir mark antony will e’en but kiss octavia and we’ll follow
till i shall see you in your soldier’s dress which will become you both farewell
we shall as i conceive the journey be at the mount before you lepidus
your way is shorter my purposes do draw me much about
you’ll win two days upon me
give me some music—music moody food of us that trade in love
as well a woman with an eunuch played as with a woman
come you’ll play with me sir
as well as i can madam
and when good will is showed though’t come too short the actor may plead pardon
give me mine angle we’ll to the river
there my music playing far off i will betray tawny finned fishes
my bended hook shall pierce their slimy jaws and as i draw them up i’ll think them every one an antony and say “ah ha
’twas merry when you wagered on your angling when your diver did hang a salt fish on his hook which he with fervency drew up
that time —o times — i laughed him out of patience and that night i laughed him into patience and next morn ere the ninth hour i drunk him to his bed then put my tires and mantles on him whilst i wore his sword philippan
ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears that long time have been barren
if thou say so villain thou kill’st thy mistress
but well and free if thou so yield him there is gold and here my bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings have lipped and trembled kissing
but sirrah mark we use to say the dead are well
bring it to that the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill uttering throat
but there’s no goodness in thy face if antony be free and healthful
so tart a favour to trumpet such good tidings
if not well thou shouldst come like a fury crowned with snakes not like a formal man
i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st
yet if thou say antony lives is well or friends with caesar or not captive to him i’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail rich pearls upon thee
caesar and he are greater friends than ever
make thee a fortune from me
i do not like “but yet” it does allay the good precedence
“but yet” is as a gaoler to bring forth some monstrous malefactor
prithee friend pour out the pack of matter to mine ear the good and bad together he’s friends with caesar in state of health thou say’st and thou say’st free
for the best turn i’ th’ bed
the most infectious pestilence upon thee
strikes him again hence horrible villain or i’ll spurn thine eyes like balls before me
she hales him up and down thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine smarting in ling’ring pickle
gracious madam i that do bring the news made not the match
say ’tis not so a province i will give thee and make thy fortunes proud
the blow thou hadst shall make thy peace for moving me to rage and i will boot thee with what gift beside thy modesty can beg
rogue thou hast lived too long
good madam keep yourself within yourself
some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt
melt egypt into nile and kindly creatures turn all to serpents
though i am mad i will not bite him
exit charmian these hands do lack nobility that they strike a meaner than myself since i myself have given myself the cause
enter the messenger again with charmian
though it be honest it is never good to bring bad news
give to a gracious message an host of tongues but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt
i cannot hate thee worser than i do if thou again say “yes ” messenger
o i would thou didst so half my egypt were submerged and made a cistern for scaled snakes
hadst thou narcissus in thy face to me thou wouldst appear most ugly
take no offence that i would not offend you
to punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal
o that his fault should make a knave of thee that art not what thou’rt sure of
the merchandise which thou hast brought from rome are all too dear for me
lie they upon thy hand and be undone by ’em
in praising antony i have dispraised caesar
lead me from hence i faint
go to the fellow good alexas bid him report the feature of octavia her years her inclination let him not leave out the colour of her hair
exit alexas let him for ever go—let him not charmian
though he be painted one way like a gorgon the other way ’s a mars
to mardian bid you alexas bring me word how tall she is
pity me charmian but do not speak to me
enter pompey and menas at one door with drum and trumpet at another caesar lepidus antony enobarbus maecenas agrippa with soldiers marching
your hostages i have so have you mine and we shall talk before we fight
most meet that first we come to words and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent which if thou hast considered let us know if ’twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here
to you all three the senators alone of this great world chief factors for the gods i do not know wherefore my father should revengers want having a son and friends since julius caesar who at philippi the good brutus ghosted there saw you labouring for him
what was’t that moved pale cassius to conspire
and what made the all honoured honest roman brutus with the armed rest courtiers of beauteous freedom to drench the capitol but that they would have one man but a man
and that is it hath made me rig my navy at whose burden the angered ocean foams with which i meant to scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father
thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails
we’ll speak with thee at sea
at land thou know’st how much we do o’ercount thee
at land indeed thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house but since the cuckoo builds not for himself remain in’t as thou mayst
be pleased to tell us— for this is from the present—how you take the offers we have sent you
which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embraced
and what may follow to try a larger fortune
you have made me offer of sicily sardinia and i must rid all the sea of pirates then to send measures of wheat to rome
this ’greed upon to part with unhacked edges and bear back our targes undinted
know then i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer
but mark antony put me to some impatience
though i lose the praise of it by telling you must know when caesar and your brother were at blows your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly
i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you
i did not think sir to have met you here
the beds i’ th’ east are soft and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained by ’t
since i saw you last there is a change upon you
well i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal
i crave our composition may be written and sealed between us
we’ll feast each other ere we part and let’s draw lots who shall begin
but first or last your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame
i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there
then so much have i heard
and i have heard apollodorus carried— enobarbus
a certain queen to caesar in a mattress
well and well am like to do for i perceive four feasts are toward
i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behaviour
sir i never loved you much but i ha’ praised ye when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did
enjoy thy plainness it nothing ill becomes thee
aboard my galley i invite you all
exeunt all but enobarbus and menas menas
thy father pompey would ne’er have made this treaty — you and i have known sir
you have done well by water
i will praise any man that will praise me though it cannot be denied what i have done by land
nor what i have done by water
yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea
there i deny my land service
but give me your hand menas
if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing
all men’s faces are true whatsome’er their hands are
but there is never a fair woman has a true face
we came hither to fight with you
for my part i am sorry it is turned to a drinking
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
if he do sure he cannot weep ’t back again
we looked not for mark antony here
pray you is he married to cleopatra
she was the wife of caius marcellus
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius
then is caesar and he for ever knit together
if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not prophesy so
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties
but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity
octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
who would not have his wife so
not he that himself is not so which is mark antony
he will to his egyptian dish again
then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance
antony will use his affection where it is
he married but his occasion here
i have a health for you
we have used our throats in egypt
on board pompey’s galley lying near misenum
enter two or three servants with a banquet
some o’ their plants are ill rooted already the least wind i’ th’ world will blow them down
they have made him drink alms drink
as they pinch one another by the disposition he cries out “no more” reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th’ drink
but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion
why this it is to have a name in great men’s fellowship
i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave
to be called into a huge sphere and not to be seen to move in ’t are the holes where eyes should be which pitifully disaster the cheeks
enter caesar antony pompey lepidus agrippa maecenas enobarbus menas with other captains
thus do they sir they take the flow o’ th’ nile by certain scales i’ th’ pyramid they know by th’ height the lowness or the mean if dearth or foison follow
the higher nilus swells the more it promises
as it ebbs the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest
your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile
i am not so well as i should be but i’ll ne’er out
i fear me you’ll be in till then
nay certainly i have heard the ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things
without contradiction i have heard that
say in mine ear what is ’t
whispers in ’s ear forsake thy seat i do beseech thee captain and hear me speak a word
aside to menas forbear me till anon — this wine for lepidus
what manner o’ thing is your crocodile
it is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth
it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs
it lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates
’tis so and the tears of it are wet
with the health that pompey gives him else he is a very epicure
aside to menas go hang sir hang
do as i bid you —where’s this cup i called for
if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me rise from thy stool
rises and walks aside the matter
i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
thou hast served me with much faith
what’s else to say — be jolly lords
these quicksands lepidus keep off them for you sink
wilt thou be lord of all the world
wilt thou be lord of the whole world
but entertain it and though you think me poor i am the man will give thee all the world
no pompey i have kept me from the cup
thou art if thou dar’st be the earthly jove
whate’er the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine if thou wilt have’t
these three world sharers these competitors are in thy vessel
let me cut the cable and when we are put off fall to their throats
ah this thou shouldst have done and not have spoke on ’t
in me ’tis villainy in thee ’t had been good service
thou must know ’tis not my profit that does lead mine honour mine honour it
repent that e’er thy tongue hath so betray’d thine act
being done unknown i should have found it afterwards well done but must condemn it now
for this i’ll never follow thy palled fortunes more
who seeks and will not take when once ’tis offered shall never find it more
i’ll pledge it for him pompey
fill till the cup be hid
pointing to the servant who carries off lepidus menas
’a bears the third part of the world man
the third part then is drunk
would it were all that it might go on wheels
this is not yet an alexandrian feast
it’s monstrous labour when i wash my brain and it grows fouler
be a child o’ the time
but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one
ha my brave emperor shall we dance now the egyptian bacchanals and celebrate our drink
come let’s all take hands till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense in soft and delicate lethe
make battery to our ears with the loud music the while i’ll place you then the boy shall sing
the holding every man shall beat as loud as his strong sides can volley
enobarbus places them hand in hand
come thou monarch of the vine plumpy bacchus with pink eyne
in thy vats our cares be drowned with thy grapes our hairs be crowned
cup us till the world go round cup us till the world go round
good brother let me request you off
our graver business frowns at this levity —gentle lords let’s part
you see we have burnt our cheeks
strong enobarb is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue splits what it speaks
the wild disguise hath almost anticked us all
i’ll try you on the shore
o antony you have my father’s house
exeunt pompey caesar antony and attendants menas i’ll not on shore
let neptune hear we bid a loud farewell to these great fellows
sound and be hanged sound out
sound a flourish with drums enobarbus
enter ventidius as it were in triumph with silius and other romans officers and soldiers the dead body of pacorus borne before him
now darting parthia art thou struck and now pleased fortune does of marcus crassus’ death make me revenger
bear the king’s son’s body before our army
thy pacorus orodes pays this for marcus crassus
noble ventidius whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm the fugitive parthians follow
spur through media mesopotamia and the shelters whither the routed fly
so thy grand captain antony shall set thee on triumphant chariots and put garlands on thy head
o silius silius i have done enough
a lower place note well may make too great an act
for learn this silius better to leave undone than by our deed acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away
caesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person
sossius one of my place in syria his lieutenant for quick accumulation of renown which he achieved by th’ minute lost his favour
who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can becomes his captain’s captain and ambition the soldier’s virtue rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him
i could do more to do antonius good but ’twould offend him and in his offence should my performance perish
thou hast ventidius that without the which a soldier and his sword grants scarce distinction
i’ll humbly signify what in his name that magical word of war we have effected how with his banners and his well paid ranks the ne’er yet beaten horse of parthia we have jaded out o’ th’ field
he purposeth to athens whither with what haste the weight we must convey with ’s will permit we shall appear before him —on there pass along
an ante chamber in caesar’s house
enter agrippa at one door enobarbus at another
they have dispatched with pompey he is gone
octavia weeps to part from rome
caesar is sad and lepidus since pompey’s feast as menas says is troubled with the greensickness
nay but how dearly he adores mark antony
why he’s the jupiter of men
would you praise caesar say “caesar”
indeed he plied them both with excellent praises
but he loves caesar best yet he loves antony
hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot think speak cast write sing number—hoo — his love to antony
but as for caesar kneel down kneel down and wonder
they are his shards and he their beetle
trumpets within so this is to horse
good fortune worthy soldier and farewell
enter caesar antony lepidus and octavia
you take from me a great part of myself
sister prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee and as my farthest bond shall pass on thy approof
most noble antony let not the piece of virtue which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love to keep it builded be the ram to batter the fortress of it
for better might we have loved without this mean if on both parts this be not cherished
make me not offended in your distrust
you shall not find though you be therein curious the least cause for what you seem to fear
so the gods keep you and make the hearts of romans serve your ends
farewell my dearest sister fare thee well
the elements be kind to thee and make thy spirits all of comfort
it is love’s spring and these the showers to bring it on —be cheerful
sir look well to my husband’s house and— caesar
i’ll tell you in your ear
her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tongue—the swan’s down feather that stands upon the swell at the full of tide and neither way inclines
he has a cloud in ’s face
he were the worse for that were he a horse so is he being a man
why enobarbus when antony found julius caesar dead he cried almost to roaring and he wept when at philippi he found brutus slain
that year indeed he was troubled with a rheum what willingly he did confound he wailed believe ’t till i weep too
no sweet octavia you shall hear from me still
the time shall not outgo my thinking on you
come sir come i’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love
look here i have you thus i let you go and give you to the gods
let all the number of the stars give light to thy fair way
enter cleopatra charmian iras and alexas
good majesty herod of jewry dare not look upon you but when you are well pleased
but how when antony is gone through whom i might command it —come thou near
madam in rome i looked her in the face and saw her led between her brother and mark antony
is she as tall as me
is she shrill tongued or low
i think so charmian dull of tongue and dwarfish
what majesty is in her gait
remember if e’er thou look’dst on majesty
her motion and her station are as one
she shows a body rather than a life a statue than a breather
three in egypt cannot make better note
he’s very knowing i do perceive’t
guess at her years i prithee
and i do think she’s thirty
bear’st thou her face in mind
for the most part too they are foolish that are so
brown madam and her forehead as low as she would wish it
thou must not take my former sharpness ill
i will employ thee back again i find thee most fit for business
go make thee ready our letters are prepared
i repent me much that so i harried him
why methinks by him this creature’s no such thing
the man hath seen some majesty and should know
isis else defend and serving you so long
i have one thing more to ask him yet good charmian
but ’tis no matter thou shalt bring him to me where i will write
nay nay octavia not only that— that were excusable that and thousands more of semblable import—but he hath waged new wars ’gainst pompey made his will and read it to public ear spoke scantly of me when perforce he could not but pay me terms of honour cold and sickly he vented them most narrow measure lent me when the best hint was given him he not took ’t or did it from his teeth
o my good lord believe not all or if you must believe stomach not all
a more unhappy lady if this division chance ne’er stood between praying for both parts
the good gods will mock me presently when i shall pray “o bless my lord and husband ” undo that prayer by crying out as loud “o bless my brother ” husband win win brother prays and destroys the prayer no midway ’twixt these extremes at all
gentle octavia let your best love draw to that point which seeks best to preserve it
if i lose mine honour i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless
but as you requested yourself shall go between’s
the meantime lady i’ll raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother
make your soonest haste so your desires are yours
the jove of power make me most weak most weak your reconciler
wars ’twixt you twain would be as if the world should cleave and that slain men should solder up the rift
when it appears to you where this begins turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them
provide your going choose your own company and command what cost your heart has mind to
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey
caesar having made use of him in the wars ’gainst pompey presently denied him rivality would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to pompey upon his own appeal seizes him
so the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine
then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more and throw between them all the food thou hast they’ll grind the one the other
he’s walking in the garden thus and spurns the rush that lies before him cries “fool lepidus ” and threats the throat of that his officer that murdered pompey
more domitius my lord desires you presently
my news i might have told hereafter
’twill be naught but let it be
contemning rome he has done all this and more in alexandria
here’s the manner of ’t i’ th’ market place on a tribunal silvered cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned
at the feet sat caesarion whom they call my father’s son and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them
unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen
i’ th’ common showplace where they exercise
his sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings great media parthia and armenia he gave to alexander to ptolemy he assigned syria cilicia and phoenicia
she in th’ habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeared and oft before gave audience as ’tis reported so
who queasy with his insolence already will their good thoughts call from him
the people knows it and have now received his accusations
caesar and that having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled we had not rated him his part o’ th’ isle
then does he say he lent me some shipping unrestored
lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed and being that we detain all his revenue
’tis done already and messenger gone
i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change
for what i have conquered i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquered kingdoms i demand the like
nor must not then be yielded to in this
that ever i should call thee castaway
you have not called me so nor have you cause
why have you stolen upon us thus
you come not like caesar’s sister
the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear
the trees by th’ way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not
nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops
but you are come a market maid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unloved
we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting
good my lord to come thus was i not constrained but did it on my free will
my lord mark antony hearing that you prepared for war acquainted my grieved ear withal whereon i begged his pardon for return
which soon he granted being an abstract ’tween his lust and him
do not say so my lord
i have eyes upon him and his affairs come to me on the wind
cleopatra hath nodded him to her
he hath given his empire up to a whore who now are levying the kings o’ th’ earth for war
he hath assembled bocchus the king of libya archelaus of cappadocia philadelphos king of paphlagonia the thracian king adallas king manchus of arabia king of pont herod of jewry mithridates king of comagene polemon and amyntas the kings of mede and lycaonia with a more larger list of sceptres
ay me most wretched that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that does afflict each other
your letters did withhold our breaking forth till we perceived both how you were wrong led and we in negligent danger
be you not troubled with the time which drives o’er your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewailed their way
welcome to rome nothing more dear to me
you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods to do you justice make their ministers of us and those that love you
best of comfort and ever welcome to us
each heart in rome does love and pity you
only th’ adulterous antony most large in his abominations turns you off and gives his potent regiment to a trull that noises it against us
pray you be ever known to patience
antony’s camp near the promontory of actium
i will be even with thee doubt it not
thou hast forspoke my being in these wars and say’st it is not fit
is ’t not denounced against us
why should not we be there in person
well i could reply if we should serve with horse and mares together the horse were merely lost
the mares would bear a soldier and his horse
your presence needs must puzzle antony take from his heart take from his brain from ’s time what should not then be spared
he is already traduced for levity and ’tis said in rome that photinus an eunuch and your maids manage this war
sink rome and their tongues rot that speak against us
a charge we bear i’ th’ war and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man
is it not strange canidius that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne —you have heard on ’t sweet
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent
a good rebuke which might have well becomed the best of men to taunt at slackness —canidius we will fight with him by sea
why will my lord do so
for that he dares us to ’t
so hath my lord dared him to single fight
ay and to wage this battle at pharsalia where caesar fought with pompey
but these offers which serve not for his vantage he shakes off and so should you
your ships are not well manned your mariners are muleteers reapers people engrossed by swift impress
in caesar’s fleet are those that often have ’gainst pompey fought
their ships are yare yours heavy
no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea being prepared for land
most worthy sir you therein throw away the absolute soldiership you have by land distract your army which doth most consist of war marked footmen leave unexecuted your own renowned knowledge quite forgo the way which promises assurance and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard from firm security
i have sixty sails caesar none better
our overplus of shipping will we burn and with the rest full manned from th’ head of actium beat th’ approaching caesar
but if we fail we then can do ’t at land
the news is true my lord he is descried
can he be there in person
’tis impossible strange that his power should be
canidius our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land and our twelve thousand horse
o noble emperor do not fight by sea
do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds
let th’ egyptians and the phoenicians go a ducking
we have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot
exeunt antony cleopatra and enobarbus soldier
by hercules i think i am i’ th’ right
but his whole action grows not in the power on ’t
so our leader’s led and we are women’s men
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole do you not
marcus octavius marcus justeius publicola and caelius are for sea but we keep whole by land
this speed of caesar’s carries beyond belief
while he was yet in rome his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies
with news the time’s with labour and throes forth each minute some
enter caesar with his army and taurus marching
strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle till we have done at sea
do not exceed the prescript of this scroll
our fortune lies upon this jump
set we our squadrons on yon side o’ th’ hill in eye of caesar’s battle from which place we may the number of the ships behold and so proceed accordingly
canidius marching with his land army one way over the stage and taurus the lieutenant of caesar with his army the other way
after their going in is heard the noise of a sea fight
th’ antoniad the egyptian admiral with all their sixty fly and turn the rudder
to see ’t mine eyes are blasted
gods and goddesses all the whole synod of them
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance
we have kissed away kingdoms and provinces
on our side like the tokened pestilence where death is sure
yon ribaudred nag of egypt whom leprosy o’ertake i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight when vantage like a pair of twins appeared both as the same—or rather ours the elder— the breeze upon her like a cow in june hoists sails and flies
mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view
she once being loofed the noble ruin of her magic antony claps on his sea wing and like a doting mallard leaving the fight in height flies after her
i never saw an action of such shame
experience manhood honour ne’er before did violate so itself
our fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably
had our general been what he knew himself it had gone well
o he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own
’tis easy to’t and there i will attend what further comes
to caesar will i render my legions and my horse
six kings already show me the way of yielding
i’ll yet follow the wounded chance of antony though my reason sits in the wind against me
hark the land bids me tread no more upon’t
it is ashamed to bear me
i am so lated in the world that i have lost my way for ever
i have a ship laden with gold
fly and make your peace with caesar
i have fled myself and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders
i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you
o i followed that i blush to look upon
my very hairs do mutiny for the white reprove the brown for rashness and they them for fear and doting
you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you
pray you look not sad nor make replies of loathness
take the hint which my despair proclaims
let that be left which leaves itself
i will possess you of that ship and treasure
leave me i pray a little—pray you now nay do so for indeed i have lost command
i’ll see you by and by
sits down enter cleopatra led by charmian iras and eros
he at philippi kept his sword e’en like a dancer while i struck the lean and wrinkled cassius and ’twas i that the mad brutus ended
he alone dealt on lieutenantry and no practice had in the brave squares of war
the queen my lord the queen
go to him madam speak to him
he is unqualitied with very shame
her head’s declined and death will seize her but your comfort makes the rescue
i have offended reputation a most unnoble swerving
o whither hast thou led me egypt
see how i convey my shame out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind ’stroyed in dishonour
o my lord my lord forgive my fearful sails
i little thought you would have followed
egypt thou knew’st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings and thou shouldst tow me after
o’er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew’st and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me
now i must to the young man send humble treaties dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness who with half the bulk o’ th’ world played as i pleased making and marring fortunes
you did know how much you were my conqueror and that my sword made weak by my affection would obey it on all cause
fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost
love i am full of lead
some wine within there and our viands
fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows
enter caesar agrippa dolabella with others
let him appear that’s come from antony
caesar ’tis his schoolmaster— an argument that he is plucked when hither he sends so poor a pinion of his wing which had superfluous kings for messengers not many moons gone by
such as i am i come from antony
i was of late as petty to his ends as is the morn dew on the myrtle leaf to his grand sea
lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and requires to live in egypt which not granted he lessens his requests and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in athens
next cleopatra does confess thy greatness submits her to thy might and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs now hazarded to thy grace
for antony i have no ears to his request
the queen of audience nor desire shall fail so she from egypt drive her all disgraced friend or take his life there
this if she perform she shall not sue unheard
to try thy eloquence now ’tis time
promise and in our name what she requires add more from thine invention offers
women are not in their best fortunes strong but want will perjure the ne’er touch’d vestal
try thy cunning thidias make thine own edict for thy pains which we will answer as a law
observe how antony becomes his flaw and what thou think’st his very action speaks in every power that moves
enter cleopatra enobarbus charmian and iras
is antony or we in fault for this
antony only that would make his will lord of his reason
what though you fled from that great face of war whose several ranges frighted each other
the itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed he being the mered question
’twas a shame no less than was his loss to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing
the queen shall then have courtesy so she will yield us up
let her know’t — to the boy caesar send this grizzled head and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities
tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him from which the world should note something particular his coin ships legions may be a coward’s whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i’ th’ command of caesar
i dare him therefore to lay his gay comparisons apart and answer me declined sword against sword ourselves alone
yes like enough high battled caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to th’ show against a sworder
i see men’s judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike
that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness
caesar thou hast subdued his judgment too
see my women against the blown rose may they stop their nose that kneeled unto the buds
mine honesty and i begin to square
the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly
yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fallen lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i’ th’ story
so haply are they friends to antony
he needs as many sir as caesar has or needs not us
if caesar please our master will leap to be his friend
for us you know whose he is we are and that is caesar’s
so — thus then thou most renowned caesar entreats not to consider in what case thou stand’st further than he is caesar
he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love but as you feared him
the scars upon your honour therefore he does pity as constrained blemishes not as deserved
he is a god and knows what is most right
mine honour was not yielded but conquered merely
to be sure of that i will ask antony
sir sir thou art so leaky that we must leave thee to thy sinking for thy dearest quit thee
shall i say to caesar what you require of him
for he partly begs to be desired to give
it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon
but it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left antony and put yourself under his shroud the universal landlord
most kind messenger say to great caesar this in deputation i kiss his conqu’ring hand
tell him i am prompt to lay my crown at’s feet and there to kneel
tell him from his all obeying breath i hear the doom of egypt
wisdom and fortune combating together if that the former dare but what it can no chance may shake it
give me grace to lay my duty on your hand
your caesar’s father oft when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in bestowed his lips on that unworthy place as it rained kisses
one that but performs the bidding of the fullest man and worthiest to have command obeyed
approach there —ah you kite —now gods and devils authority melts from me
of late when i cried “ho ” like boys unto a muss kings would start forth and cry “your will ” have you no ears
take hence this jack and whip him
’tis better playing with a lion’s whelp than with an old one dying
were’t twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name since she was cleopatra
whip him fellows till like a boy you see him cringe his face and whine aloud for mercy
this jack of caesar’s shall bear us an errand to him
exeunt servants with thidias you were half blasted ere i knew you
have i my pillow left unpressed in rome forborne the getting of a lawful race and by a gem of women to be abused by one that looks on feeders
you have been a boggler ever
but when we in our viciousness grow hard— o misery on’t —the wise gods seal our eyes in our own filth drop our clear judgments make us adore our errors laugh at’s while we strut to our confusion
i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar’s trencher nay you were a fragment of gneius pompey’s besides what hotter hours unregistered in vulgar fame you have luxuriously pick’d out
for i am sure though you can guess what temperance should be you know not what it is
to let a fellow that will take rewards and say “god quit you ” be familiar with my playfellow your hand this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts
o that i were upon the hill of basan to outroar the horned herd
for i have savage cause and to proclaim it civilly were like a haltered neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him
if that thy father live let him repent thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph since thou hast been whipped for following him
henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee shake thou to look on’t
get thee back to caesar tell him thy entertainment
look thou say he makes me angry with him for he seems proud and disdainful harping on what i am not what he knew i was
he makes me angry and at this time most easy ’tis to do’t when my good stars that were my former guides have empty left their orbs and shot their fires into th’ abysm of hell
if he mislike my speech and what is done tell him he has hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom he may at pleasure whip or hang or torture as he shall like to quit me
hence with thy stripes be gone
alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed and it portends alone the fall of antony
to flatter caesar would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points
ah dear if i be so from my cold heart let heaven engender hail and poison it in the source and the first stone drop in my neck as it determines so dissolve my life
the next caesarion smite till by degrees the memory of my womb together with my brave egyptians all by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey
caesar sits down in alexandria where i will oppose his fate
our force by land hath nobly held our severed navy too have knit again and fleet threat’ning most sea like
where hast thou been my heart
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips i will appear in blood
i and my sword will earn our chronicle
i will be treble sinewed hearted breathed and fight maliciously
for when mine hours were nice and lucky men did ransom lives of me for jests
but now i’ll set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me
come let’s have one other gaudy night
call to me all my sad captains
fill our bowls once more let’s mock the midnight bell
i had thought t’have held it poor but since my lord is antony again i will be cleopatra
call all his noble captains to my lord
do so we’ll speak to them and tonight i’ll force the wine peep through their scars
come on my queen there’s sap in’t yet
the next time i do fight i’ll make death love me for i will contend even with his pestilent scythe
to be furious is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge and i see still a diminution in our captain’s brain restores his heart
when valour preys on reason it eats the sword it fights with
i will seek some way to leave him
exit act iv scene i caesar’s camp at alexandria
enter caesar agrippa and maecenas with his army
he calls me boy and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt
my messenger he hath whipped with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to antony
let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die meantime laugh at his challenge
caesar must think when one so great begins to rage he’s hunted even to falling
give him no breath but now make boot of his distraction
never anger made good guard for itself
let our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight
within our files there are of those that served mark antony but late enough to fetch him in
see it done and feast the army we have store to do’t and they have earned the waste
enter antony cleopatra enobarbus charmian iras alexas with others
he will not fight with me domitius
he thinks being twenty times of better fortune he is twenty men to one
tomorrow soldier by sea and land i’ll fight
or i will live or bathe my dying honour in the blood shall make it live again
i’ll strike and cry “take all ” antony
let’s tonight be bounteous at our meal — enter servants
thou has been rightly honest so hast thou thou and thou and thou
you have served me well and kings have been your fellows
’tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots out of the mind
i wish i could be made so many men and all of you clapped up together in an antony that i might do you service so good as you have done
well my good fellows wait on me tonight
scant not my cups and make as much of me as when mine empire was your fellow too and suffered my command
tend me tonight may be it is the period of your duty
haply you shall not see me more or if a mangled shadow
perchance tomorrow you’ll serve another master
i look on you as one that takes his leave
mine honest friends i turn you not away but like a master married to your good service stay till death
tend me tonight two hours i ask no more and the gods yield you for’t
what mean you sir to give them this discomfort
look they weep and i an ass am onion eyed
for shame transform us not to women
now the witch take me if i meant it thus
grace grow where those drops fall
my hearty friends you take me in too dolorous a sense for i spake to you for your comfort did desire you to burn this night with torches
know my hearts i hope well of tomorrow and will lead you where rather i’ll expect victorious life than death and honour
let’s to supper come and drown consideration
heard you of nothing strange about the streets
they place themselves in every corner of the stage second soldier
and if tomorrow our navy thrive i have an absolute hope our landmen will stand up
’tis a brave army and full of purpose
music of the hautboys under the stage second soldier
it signs well does it not
’tis the god hercules whom antony loved now leaves him
let’s see if other watchmen do hear what we do
they advance to another post second soldier
follow the noise so far as we have quarter
let’s see how it will give off
enter antony and cleopatra with others
come good fellow put thine iron on
if fortune be not ours today it is because we brave her
thou art the armourer of my heart
well well we shall thrive now
he that unbuckles this till we do please to daff’t for our repose shall hear a storm
thou fumblest eros and my queen’s a squire more tight at this than thou
o love that thou couldst see my wars today and knew’st the royal occupation thou shouldst see a workman in’t
thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge
to business that we love we rise betime and go to’t with delight
a thousand sir early though’t be have on their riveted trim and at the port expect you
trumpets flourish enter other captains and soldiers
this morning like the spirit of a youth that means to be of note begins betimes
whate’er becomes of me this is a soldier’s kiss
kisses her rebukeable and worthy shameful check it were to stand on more mechanic compliment
i’ll leave thee now like a man of steel —you that will fight follow me close i’ll bring you to’t
exeunt antony eros captains and soldiers charmian
please you retire to your chamber
that he and caesar might determine this great war in single fight
exeunt scene v antony’s camp near alexandria
enter antony and eros a soldier meeting them
the gods make this a happy day to antony
would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed to make me fight at land
hadst thou done so the kings that have revolted and the soldier that has this morning left thee would have still followed thy heels
call for enobarbus he shall not hear thee or from caesar’s camp say “i am none of thine ” antony
sir his chests and treasure he has not with him
go eros send his treasure after
detain no jot i charge thee
write to him— i will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings
say that i wish he never find more cause to change a master
o my fortunes have corrupted honest men
enter agrippa caesar with enobarbus and dolabella
go forth agrippa and begin the fight
our will is antony be took alive make it so known
the time of universal peace is near
prove this a prosp’rous day the three nooked world shall bear the olive freely
antony is come into the field
go charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the van that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself
exeunt caesar and his train enobarbus
alexas did revolt and went to jewry on affairs of antony there did dissuade great herod to incline himself to caesar and leave his master antony
for this pains casaer hath hanged him
canidius and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honourable trust
i have done ill of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more
enobarbus antony hath after thee sent all thy treasure with his bounty overplus
the messenger came on my guard and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules
best you safed the bringer out of the host
i must attend mine office or would have done’t myself
your emperor continues still a jove
i am alone the villain of the earth and feel i am so most
o antony thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid my better service when my turpitude thou dost so crown with gold
if swift thought break it not a swifter mean shall outstrike thought but thought will do’t i feel
no i will go seek some ditch wherein to die the foul’st best fits my latter part of life
field of battle between the camps
we have engaged ourselves too far
caesar himself has work and our oppression exceeds what we expected
o my brave emperor this is fought indeed
had we done so at first we had droven them home with clouts about their heads
i had a wound here that was like a t but now ’tis made an h sounds retreat far off antony
we’ll beat ’em into bench holes
i have yet room for six scotches more
they are beaten sir and our advantage serves for a fair victory
let us score their backs and snatch ’em up as we take hares behind
’tis sport to maul a runner
i will reward thee once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold for thy good valour
enter antony again in a march scarus with others
we have beat him to his camp
run one before and let the queen know of our gests
tomorrow before the sun shall see’s we’ll spill the blood that has today escaped
i thank you all for doughty handed are you and have fought not as you served the cause but as’t had been each man’s like mine
enter the city clip your wives your friends tell them your feats whilst they with joyful tears wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss the honoured gashes whole
to this great fairy i’ll commend thy acts make her thanks bless thee
o thou day o’ th’ world chain mine armed neck
leap thou attire and all through proof of harness to my heart and there ride on the pants triumphing
o infinite virtue com’st thou smiling from the world’s great snare uncaught
mine nightingale we have beat them to their beds
though grey do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha’ we a brain that nourishes our nerves and can get goal for goal of youth
commend unto his lips thy favouring hand — kiss it my warrior
he hath fought today as if a god in hate of mankind had destroyed in such a shape
i’ll give thee friend an armour all of gold
he has deserved it were it carbuncled like holy phœbus’ car
through alexandria make a jolly march bear our hacked targets like the men that owe them
had our great palace the capacity to camp this host we all would sup together and drink carouses to the next day’s fate which promises royal peril —trumpeters with brazen din blast you the city’s ear make mingle with our rattling tabourines that heaven and earth may strike their sounds together applauding our approach
enter a sentry and his company
if we be not relieved within this hour we must return to th’ court of guard
the night is shiny and they say we shall embattle by th’ second hour i’ th’ morn
this last day was a shrewd one to’s
o bear me witness night — second watch
be witness to me o thou blessed moon when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory poor enobarbus did before thy face repent
o sovereign mistress of true melancholy the poisonous damp of night disponge upon me that life a very rebel to my will may hang no longer on me
throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault which being dried with grief will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts
o antony nobler than my revolt is infamous forgive me in thine own particular but let the world rank me in register a master leaver and a fugitive
let’s hear him for the things he speaks may concern caesar
swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his was never yet for sleep
the hand of death hath raught him
the drums demurely wake the sleepers
let us bear him to th’ court of guard he is of note
exeunt with the body scene x
enter antony and scarus with their army
their preparation is today by sea we please them not by land
i would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air we’d fight there too
but this it is our foot upon the hills adjoining to the city shall stay with us—order for sea is given they have put forth the haven— where their appointment we may best discover and look on their endeavour
but being charged we will be still by land which as i take’t we shall for his best force is forth to man his galleys
to the vales and hold our best advantage
alarum afar off as at a sea fight
where yond pine does stand i shall discover all
i’ll bring thee word straight how ’tis like to go
swallows have built in cleopatra’s sails their nests
the augurs say they know not they cannot tell look grimly and dare not speak their knowledge
antony is valiant and dejected and by starts his fretted fortunes give him hope and fear of what he has and has not
this foul egyptian hath betrayed me
my fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder they cast their caps up and carouse together like friends long lost
’tis thou hast sold me to this novice and my heart makes only wars on thee
bid them all fly for when i am revenged upon my charm i have done all
exit scarus o sun thy uprise shall i see no more
fortune and antony part here even here do we shake hands
the hearts that spanieled me at heels to whom i gave their wishes do discandy melt their sweets on blossoming caesar and this pine is barked that overtopped them all
betray’d i am o this false soul of egypt
this grave charm whose eye becked forth my wars and called them home whose bosom was my crownet my chief end like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose beguiled me to the very heart of loss
why is my lord enraged against his love
vanish or i shall give thee thy deserving and blemish caesar’s triumph
let him take thee and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians
follow his chariot like the greatest spot of all thy sex most monster like be shown for poor’st diminutives for dolts and let patient octavia plough thy visage up with her prepared nails
exit cleopatra ’tis well thou’rt gone if it be well to live but better ’twere thou fell’st into my fury for one death might have prevented many —eros ho — the shirt of nessus is upon me
teach me alcides thou mine ancestor thy rage
let me lodge lichas on the horns o’ th’ moon and with those hands that grasped the heaviest club subdue my worthiest self
to the young roman boy she hath sold me and i fall under this plot
enter cleopatra charmian iras and mardian
o he is more mad than telamon for his shield the boar of thessaly was never so embossed
there lock yourself and send him word you are dead
the soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off
mardian go tell him i have slain myself
say that the last i spoke was “antony” and word it prithee piteously
hence mardian and bring me how he takes my death —to th’ monument
sometime we see a cloud that’s dragonish a vapour sometime like a bear or lion a towered citadel a pendant rock a forked mountain or blue promontory with trees upon’t that nod unto the world and mock our eyes with air
that which is now a horse even with a thought the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct as water is in water
my good knave eros now thy captain is even such a body
here i am antony yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
i made these wars for egypt and the queen whose heart i thought i had for she had mine which whilst it was mine had annexed unto’t a million more now lost—she eros has packed cards with caesar and false played my glory unto an enemy’s triumph
there is left us ourselves to end ourselves
she has robbed me of my sword
no antony my mistress loved thee and her fortunes mingled with thine entirely
she hath betrayed me and shall die the death
death of one person can be paid but once and that she has discharged
what thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand
the last she spake was “antony
most noble antony ” then in the midst a tearing groan did break the name of antony it was divided between her heart and lips
she rendered life thy name so buried in her
the long day’s task is done and we must sleep —that thou depart’st hence safe does pay thy labour richly
the sevenfold shield of ajax cannot keep the battery from my heart
heart once be stronger than thy continent crack thy frail case
bruised pieces go you have been nobly borne
exit eros i will o’ertake thee cleopatra and weep for my pardon
so it must be for now all length is torture
since the torch is out lie down and stray no farther
now all labour mars what it does yea very force entangles itself with strength
seal then and all is done
eros —i come my queen —eros —stay for me
where souls do couch on flowers we’ll hand in hand and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
dido and her aeneas shall want troops and all the haunt be ours —come eros eros
since cleopatra died i have lived in such dishonour that the gods detest my baseness
i that with my sword quartered the world and o’er green neptune’s back with ships made cities condemn myself to lack the courage of a woman less noble mind than she which by her death our caesar tells “i am conqueror of myself ” thou art sworn eros that when the exigent should come which now is come indeed when i should see behind me th’ inevitable prosecution of disgrace and horror that on my command thou then wouldst kill me
thou strik’st not me ’tis caesar thou defeat’st
shall i do that which all the parthian darts though enemy lost aim and could not
eros wouldst thou be windowed in great rome and see thy master thus with pleached arms bending down his corrigible neck his face subdued to penetrative shame whilst the wheeled seat of fortunate caesar drawn before him branded his baseness that ensued
come then for with a wound i must be cured
draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn most useful for thy country
when i did make thee free swor’st thou not then to do this when i bade thee
do it at once or thy precedent services are all but accidents unpurposed
turn from me then that noble countenance wherein the worship of the whole world lies
then let it do at once the thing why thou hast drawn it
my dear master my captain and my emperor let me say before i strike this bloody stroke farewell
kills himself thus do i escape the sorrow of antony’s death
thou teachest me o valiant eros what i should and thou couldst not
my queen and eros have by their brave instruction got upon me a nobleness in record
but i will be a bridegroom in my death and run into’t as to a lover’s bed
come then and eros thy master dies thy scholar
to do thus falling on his sword i learned of thee
enter a company of the guard one of them dercetus
i have done my work ill friends
o make an end of what i have begun
and time is at his period
let him that loves me strike me dead
thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly
this sword but shown to caesar with this tidings shall enter me with him
draw thy sword and give me sufficing strokes for death
most absolute lord my mistress cleopatra sent me to thee
she had a prophesying fear of what hath come to pass
for when she saw— which never shall be found—you did suspect she had disposed with caesar and that your rage would not be purged she sent you word she was dead but fearing since how it might work hath sent me to proclaim the truth and i am come i dread too late
enter four or five of the guard of antony
bear me good friends where cleopatra bides
’tis the last service that i shall command you
woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear all your true followers out
nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate to grace it with your sorrows
bid that welcome which comes to punish us and we punish it seeming to bear it lightly
i have led you oft carry me now good friends and have my thanks for all
enter cleopatra and her maids aloft with charmian and iras
o charmian i will never go from hence
all strange and terrible events are welcome but comforts we despise
our size of sorrow proportioned to our cause must be as great as that which makes it
his death’s upon him but not dead
look out o’ th’ other side your monument his guard have brought him thither
enter below antony borne by the guard
o sun burn the great sphere thou mov’st in
darkling stand the varying shore o’ th’ world
not caesar’s valour hath o’erthrown antony but antony’s hath triumphed on itself
so it should be that none but antony should conquer antony but woe ’tis so
only i here importune death awhile until of many thousand kisses the poor last i lay upon thy lips
i dare not dear dear my lord pardon
i dare not lest i be taken
not th’ imperious show of the full fortuned caesar ever shall be brooched with me if knife drugs serpents have edge sting or operation i am safe
your wife octavia with her modest eyes and still conclusion shall acquire no honour demuring upon me
but come come antony— help me my women—we must draw thee up
o quick or i am gone
our strength is all gone into heaviness that makes the weight
had i great juno’s power the strong winged mercury should fetch thee up and set thee by jove’s side
yet come a little wishers were ever fools
o come come come they heave antony aloft to cleopatra and welcome welcome
die where thou hast lived quicken with kissing
had my lips that power thus would i wear them out
give me some wine and let me speak a little
no let me speak and let me rail so high that the false huswife fortune break her wheel provoked by my offence
one word sweet queen of caesar seek your honour with your safety
none about caesar trust but proculeius
my resolution and my hands i’ll trust none about caesar
the miserable change now at my end lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts in feeding them with those my former fortunes wherein i lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world the noblest and do now not basely die not cowardly put off my helmet to my countryman a roman by a roman valiantly vanquished
now my spirit is going i can no more
hast thou no care of me
shall i abide in this dull world which in thy absence is no better than a sty
o see my women antony dies the crown o’ th’ earth doth melt —my lord
o withered is the garland of the war the soldier’s pole is fallen young boys and girls are level now with men
the odds is gone and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon
she is dead too our sovereign
no more but e’en a woman and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares
it were for me to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods to tell them that this world did equal theirs till they had stolen our jewel
all’s but naught patience is sottish and impatience does become a dog that’s mad
then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death ere death dare come to us
look our lamp is spent it’s out
we’ll bury him and then what’s brave what’s noble let’s do it after the high roman fashion and make death proud to take us
this case of that huge spirit now is cold
come we have no friend but resolution and the briefest end
exeunt bearing off antony’s body act v scene i caesar’s camp before alexandria
enter caesar agrippa dolabella maecenas gallus proculeius with his council of war
go to him dolabella bid him yield
being so frustrate tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes
exit enter dercetus with the sword of antony
and what art thou that dar’st appear thus to us
mark antony i served who best was worthy best to be served
whilst he stood up and spoke he was my master and i wore my life to spend upon his haters
if thou please to take me to thee as i was to him i’ll be to caesar if thou pleasest not i yield thee up my life
i say o caesar antony is dead
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack
the round world should have shook lions into civil streets and citizens to their dens
the death of antony is not a single doom in the name lay a moiety of the world
he is dead caesar not by a public minister of justice nor by a hired knife but that self hand which writ his honour in the acts it did hath with the courage which the heart did lend it splitted the heart
i robbed his wound of it
behold it stained with his most noble blood
the gods rebuke me but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings
and strange it is that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds
his taints and honours waged equal with him
a rarer spirit never did steer humanity but you gods will give us some faults to make us men
when such a spacious mirror’s set before him he needs must see himself
o antony i have followed thee to this but we do lance diseases in our bodies
i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day or look on thine
we could not stall together in the whole world
but yet let me lament with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts that thou my brother my competitor in top of all design my mate in empire friend and companion in the front of war the arm of mine own body and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars unreconciliable should divide our equalness to this
hear me good friends— enter an egyptian
but i will tell you at some meeter season
the business of this man looks out of him we’ll hear him what he says
the queen my mistress confined in all she has her monument of thy intents desires instruction that she preparedly may frame herself to the way she’s forced to
she soon shall know of us by some of ours how honourable and how kindly we determine for her
for caesar cannot lean to be ungentle
go and say we purpose her no shame
give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke she do defeat us for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph
go and with your speediest bring us what she says and how you find of her
exit gallus where’s dolabella to second proculeius
let him alone for i remember now how he’s employed
he shall in time be ready
go with me to my tent where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings
go with me and see what i can show in this
my desolation does begin to make a better life
’tis paltry to be caesar not being fortune he’s but fortune’s knave a minister of her will
and it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds which shackles accidents and bolts up change which sleeps and never palates more the dung the beggar’s nurse and caesar’s
caesar sends greetings to the queen of egypt and bids thee study on what fair demands thou mean’st to have him grant thee
antony did tell me of you bade me trust you but i do not greatly care to be deceived that have no use for trusting
if your master would have a queen his beggar you must tell him that majesty to keep decorum must no less beg than a kingdom
if he please to give me conquered egypt for my son he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks
you are fallen into a princely hand fear nothing
make your full reference freely to my lord who is so full of grace that it flows over on all that need
let me report to him your sweet dependency and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness where he for grace is kneeled to
pray you tell him i am his fortune’s vassal and i send him the greatness he has got
i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience and would gladly look him i’ th’ face
have comfort for i know your plight is pitied of him that caused it
you see how easily she may be surprised
o cleopatra thou art taken queen
seizes and disarms her do not yourself such wrong who are in this relieved but not betrayed
what of death too that rids our dogs of languish
cleopatra do not abuse my master’s bounty by th’ undoing of yourself
let the world see his nobleness well acted which your death will never let come forth
come come and take a queen worth many babes and beggars
sir i will eat no meat i’ll not drink sir if idle talk will once be necessary i’ll not sleep neither
this mortal house i’ll ruin do caesar what he can
know sir that i will not wait pinioned at your master’s court nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia
shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome
rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me
rather on nilus’ mud lay me stark naked and let the water flies blow me into abhorring
rather make my country’s high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar
proculeius what thou hast done thy master caesar knows and he hath sent for thee
for the queen i’ll take her to my guard
so dolabella it shall content me best
to cleopatra to caesar i will speak what you shall please if you’ll employ me to him
most noble empress you have heard of me
no matter sir what i have heard or known
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams is’t not your trick
i dreamt there was an emperor antony
o such another sleep that i might see but such another man
if it might please you— cleopatra
his face was as the heavens and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth
his legs bestrid the ocean his reared arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder
for his bounty there was no winter in’t an autumn ’twas that grew the more by reaping
his delights were dolphin like they showed his back above the element they lived in
in his livery walked crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket
think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of
you lie up to the hearing of the gods
but if there be nor ever were one such it’s past the size of dreaming
nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet t’ imagine an antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy condemning shadows quite
your loss is as yourself great and you bear it as answering to the weight
would i might never o’ertake pursued success but i do feel by the rebound of yours a grief that smites my very heart at root
know you what caesar means to do with me
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew
he’ll lead me then in triumph
enter caesar proculeius gallus maecenas and others of his train
which is the queen of egypt
sir the gods will have it thus
my master and my lord i must obey
take to you no hard thoughts
the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance
sole sir o’ th’ world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex
cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce
if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antony’s course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which i’ll guard them from if thereon you rely
and may through all the world
’tis yours and we your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall hang in what place you please
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra
this is the brief of money plate and jewels i am possessed of
’tis exactly valued not petty things admitted
let him speak my lord upon his peril that i have reserved to myself nothing
madam i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not
enough to purchase what you have made known
i approve your wisdom in the deed
o behold how pomp is followed
mine will now be yours and should we shift estates yours would be mine
the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild
o slave of no more trust than love that’s hired
thou shalt go back i warrant thee
but i’ll catch thine eyes though they had wings
good queen let us entreat you
o caesar what a wounding shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy
say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reserved immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred
it smites me beneath the fall i have
prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through th’ ashes of my chance
wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me
be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others’ merits in our name are therefore to be pitied
cleopatra not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged put we i’ th’ roll of conquest
still be’t yours bestow it at your pleasure and believe caesar’s no merchant to make prize with you of things that merchants sold
therefore be cheered make not your thoughts your prisons
no dear queen for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel
our care and pity is so much upon you that we remain your friend and so adieu
exeunt caesar and his train cleopatra
he words me girls he words me that i should not be noble to myself
the bright day is done and we are for the dark
i have spoke already and it is provided
go put it to the haste
madam as thereto sworn by your command which my love makes religion to obey i tell you this caesar through syria intends his journey and within three days you with your children will he send before
make your best use of this
i have performed your pleasure and my promise
dolabella i shall remain your debtor
exit dolabella now iras what think’st thou
thou an egyptian puppet shall be shown in rome as well as i
mechanic slaves with greasy aprons rules and hammers shall uplift us to the view
in their thick breaths rank of gross diet shall we be enclouded and forced to drink their vapour
saucy lictors will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers ballad us out o’ tune
the quick comedians extemporally will stage us and present our alexandrian revels antony shall be brought drunken forth and i shall see some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness i’ th’ posture of a whore
i’ll never see’t for i am sure mine nails are stronger than mine eyes
why that’s the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents
show me my women like a queen
i am again for cydnus to meet mark antony
now noble charmian we’ll dispatch indeed and when thou hast done this chare i’ll give thee leave to play till doomsday
a noise within wherefore’s this noise
here is a rural fellow that will not be denied your highness’ presence
exit guardsman what poor an instrument may do a noble deed
my resolution’s placed and i have nothing of woman in me
now from head to foot i am marble constant
now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine
enter guardsman and clown with a basket
exit guardsman hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there that kills and pains not
truly i have him but i would not be the party that should desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal
those that do die of it do seldom or never recover
remember’st thou any that have died on’t
very many men and women too
i heard of one of them no longer than yesterday—a very honest woman but something given to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty—how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt
truly she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do
but this is most falliable the worm’s an odd worm
i wish you all joy of the worm
you must think this look you that the worm will do his kind
look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm
take thou no care it shall be heeded
give it nothing i pray you for it is not worth the feeding
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman
i know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not
but truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in every ten that they make the devils mar five
i wish you joy o’ th’ worm
exit enter iras with a robe crown c cleopatra
i have immortal longings in me
now no more the juice of egypt’s grape shall moist this lip
i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act
i hear him mock the luck of caesar which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath
now to that name my courage prove my title
i am fire and air my other elements i give to baser life —so have you done
come then and take the last warmth of my lips
iras falls and dies have i the aspic in my lips
if thou and nature can so gently part the stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch which hurts and is desired
if thus thou vanishest thou tell’st the world it is not worth leave taking
dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say the gods themselves do weep
if she first meet the curled antony he’ll make demand of her and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have —come thou mortal wretch to an asp which she applies to her breast with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie
poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch
o couldst thou speak that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied
dost thou not see my baby at my breast that sucks the nurse asleep
as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle— o antony —nay i will take thee too
applying another asp to her arm what should i stay— dies charmian
now boast thee death in thy possession lies a lass unparalleled
downy windows close and golden phœbus never be beheld of eyes again so royal
your crown’s awry i’ll mend it and then play
applies an asp o come apace dispatch
it is well done and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings
caesar thy thoughts touch their effects in this
thyself art coming to see performed the dreaded act which thou so sought’st to hinder
enter caesar and all his train marching
a way there a way for caesar
o sir you are too sure an augurer that you did fear is done
bravest at the last she levelled at our purposes and being royal took her own way
i do not see them bleed
a simple countryman that brought her figs
o caesar this charmian lived but now she stood and spake
i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropped
if they had swallowed poison ’twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace
here on her breast there is a vent of blood and something blown
the like is on her arm
this is an aspic’s trail and these fig leaves have slime upon them such as th’ aspic leaves upon the caves of nile
most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die
take up her bed and bear her women from the monument
she shall be buried by her antony
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous
high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral and then to rome
come dolabella see high order in this great solemnity
exeunt omnes as you like it dramatis personae
scene i orchard of oliver s house enter orlando and adam orlando
as i remember adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou say st charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness
my brother jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit
for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox
his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hir d but i his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i
besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me
he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education
this is it adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which i think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude
i will no longer endure it though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it
yonder comes my master your brother
go apart adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up
nothing i am not taught to make any thing
marry sir i am helping you to mar that which god made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness
marry sir be better employed and be nought awhile
shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them
what prodigal portion have i spent that i should come to such penury
know you where you are sir
o sir very well here in your orchard
ay better than him i am before knows me
i know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me
the courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first born but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us
i have as much of my father in me as you albeit i confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence
come come elder brother you are too young in this
wilt thou lay hands on me villain
i am no villain i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys
he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains
wert thou not my brother i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull d out thy tongue for saying so
thou has rail d on thyself
coming forward sweet masters be patient for your father s remembrance be at accord
i will not till i please you shall hear me
my father charg d you in his will to give me good education you have train d me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman like qualities
the spirit of my father grows strong in me and i will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that i will go buy my fortunes
i will not long be troubled with you you shall have some part of your will
i no further offend you than becomes me for my good
get you with him you old dog
most true i have lost my teeth in your service
god be with my old master
he would not have spoke such a word
begin you to grow upon me
i will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither
not charles the duke s wrestler here to speak with me
so please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you
exit dennis twill be a good way and to morrow the wrestling is
what s the new news at the new court
there s no news at the court sir but the old news that is the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander
can you tell if rosalind the duke s daughter be banished with her father
o no for the duke s daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her
she is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do
where will the old duke live
they say he is already in the forest of arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old robin hood of england
they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world
what you wrestle to morrow before the new duke
marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a matter
i am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguis d against me to try a fall
to morrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well
your brother is but young and tender and for your love i would be loath to foil him as i must for my own honour if he come in therefore out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is thing of his own search and altogether against my will
charles i thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite
i had myself notice of my brother s purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute
i ll tell thee charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full of ambition an envious emulator of every man s good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother
therefore use thy discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger
and thou wert best look to t for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta en thy life by some indirect means or other for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living
i speak but brotherly of him but should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
i am heartily glad i came hither to you
if he come to morrow i ll give him his payment
if ever he go alone again i ll never wrestle for prize more
and so god keep your worship
now will i stir this gamester
i hope i shall see an end of him for my soul yet i know not why hates nothing more than he
yet he s gentle never school d and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that i am altogether misprised
but it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all
nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither which now i ll go about
a lawn before the duke s palace enter rosalind and celia celia
i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry
dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of and would you yet i were merrier
unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
herein i see thou lov st me not with the full weight that i love thee
if my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou hadst been still with me i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper d as mine is to thee
well i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours
you know my father hath no child but i nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce i will render thee again in affection
by mine honour i will and when i break that oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet rose my dear rose be merry
from henceforth i will coz and devise sports
let me see what think you of falling in love
marry i prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again
what shall be our sport then
let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
i would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women
tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very ill favouredly
nay now thou goest from fortune s office to nature s fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of nature
no when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by fortune fall into the fire
though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when fortune makes nature s natural the cutter off of nature s wit
peradventure this is not fortune s work neither but nature s who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits
mistress you must come away to your father
no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you
where learned you that oath fool
of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught
now i ll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn
how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave
by our beards if we had them thou art
by my knavery if i had it then i were
but if you swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard
prithee who is t that thou mean st
one that old frederick your father loves
my father s love is enough to honour him
enough speak no more of him you ll be whipt for taxation one of these days
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly
by my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show
with his mouth full of news
which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
then shall we be news cramm d
all the better we shall be the more marketable
fair princess you have lost much good sport
well said that was laid on with a trowel
nay if i keep not my rank rosalind
i would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of
yet tell us the manner of the wrestling
i will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it
well the beginning that is dead and buried
there comes an old man and his three sons celia
i could match this beginning with an old tale
three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
with bills on their necks be it known unto all men by these presents le beau
the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the duke s wrestler which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him
so he serv d the second and so the third
yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping
but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost
why this that i speak of
thus men may grow wiser every day
it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides
is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking
shall we see this wrestling cousin
you must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it
let us now stay and see it
enter duke frederick lords orlando charles and attendants frederick
come on since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness
alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
are you crept hither to see the wrestling
ay my liege so please you give us leave
you will take little delight in it i can tell you there is such odds in the man
in pity of the challenger s youth i would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated
speak to him ladies see if you can move him
call him hither good monsieur le beau
do so i ll not be by
duke frederick goes apart le beau
monsieur the challenger the princess calls for you
i attend them with all respect and duty
young man have you challeng d charles the wrestler
no fair princess he is the general challenger
i come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth
young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years
you have seen cruel proof of this man s strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise
we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward
i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing
but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foil d there is but one sham d that was never gracious if kill d but one dead that is willing to be so
i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty
the little strength that i have i would it were with you
and mine to eke out hers
pray heaven i be deceiv d in you
your heart s desires be with you
come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth
ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
you shall try but one fall
no i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first
you mean to mock me after you should not have mock d me before but come your ways
now hercules be thy speed young man
i would i were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye i can tell who should down
yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breath d
what is thy name young man
orlando my liege the youngest son of sir rowland de boys
i would thou hadst been son to some man else
the world esteem d thy father honourable but i did find him still mine enemy
thou shouldst have better pleas d me with this deed hadst thou descended from another house
but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth i would thou hadst told me of another father
exeunt duke train and le beau celia
were i my father coz would i do this
i am more proud to be sir rowland s son his youngest son and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to frederick
my father lov d sir rowland as his soul and all the world was of my father s mind had i before known this young man his son i should have given him tears unto entreaties ere he should thus have ventur d
gentle cousin let us go thank him and encourage him my father s rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart
sir you have well deserv d if you do keep your promises in love but justly as you have exceeded all promise your mistress shall be happy
gentleman giving him a chain from her neck wear this for me one out of suits with fortune that could give more but that her hand lacks means
can i not say i thank you
my better parts are all thrown down and that which here stands up is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
my pride fell with my fortunes i ll ask him what he would
sir you have wrestled well and overthrown more than your enemies
what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
i cannot speak to her yet she urg d conference
o poor orlando thou art overthrown
or charles or something weaker masters thee
re enter le beau le beau
good sir i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place
albeit you have deserv d high commendation true applause and love yet such is now the duke s condition that he misconstrues all that you have done
the duke is humorous what he is indeed more suits you to conceive than i to speak of
i thank you sir and pray you tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling
neither his daughter if we judge by manners but yet indeed the smaller is his daughter the other is daughter to the banish d duke and here detain d by her usurping uncle to keep his daughter company whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
but i can tell you that of late this duke hath ta en displeasure gainst his gentle niece grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father s sake and on my life his malice gainst the lady will suddenly break forth
hereafter in a better world than this i shall desire more love and knowledge of you
i rest much bounden to you fare you well
exit le beau thus must i from the smoke into the smother from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
the duke s palace enter celia and rosalind celia
not one to throw at a dog
no thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
then there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lam d with reasons and the other mad without any
but is all this for your father
no some of it is for my child s father
o how full of briers is this working day world
they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them
i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart
i would try if i could cry hem and have him
come come wrestle with thy affections
o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
o a good wish upon you
you will try in time in despite of a fall
but turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest
is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland s youngest son
the duke my father lov d his father dearly
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly
by this kind of chase i should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate not orlando
no faith hate him not for my sake
enter duke frederick with lords rosalind
let me love him for that and do you love him because i do
with his eyes full of anger
mistress dispatch you with your safest haste and get you from our court
within these ten days if that thou beest found so near our public court as twenty miles thou diest for it
i do beseech your grace let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires if that i do not dream or be not frantic as i do trust i am not then dear uncle never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness
thus do all traitors if their purgation did consist in words they are as innocent as grace itself
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not
yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
tell me whereon the likelihood depends
thou art thy father s daughter there s enough
so was i when your highness took his dukedom so was i when your highness banish d him
treason is not inherited my lord or if we did derive it from our friends what s that to me
then good my liege mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous
ay celia we stay d her for your sake else had she with her father rang d along
i did not then entreat to have her stay it was your pleasure and your own remorse i was too young that time to value her but now i know her
if she be a traitor why so am i we still have slept together rose at an instant learn d play d eat together and wheresoe er we went like juno s swans still we went coupled and inseparable
she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness her very silence and her patience speak to the people and they pity her
she robs thee of thy name and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone
firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have pass d upon her she is banish d
pronounce that sentence then on me my liege i cannot live out of her company
if you outstay the time upon mine honour and in the greatness of my word you die
i charge thee be not thou more griev d than i am
know st thou not the duke hath banish d me his daughter
rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
no let my father seek another heir
therefore devise with me how we may fly whither to go and what to bear with us and do not seek to take your charge upon you to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale say what thou canst i ll go along with thee
to seek my uncle in the forest of arden
alas what danger will it be to us maids as we are to travel forth so far
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
i ll put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face the like do you so shall we pass along and never stir assailants
were it not better because that i am more than common tall that i did suit me all points like a man
a gallant curtle axe upon my thigh a boar spear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden woman s fear there will we ll have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances
what shall i call thee when thou art a man
i ll have no worse a name than jove s own page and therefore look you call me ganymede
but what will you be call d
something that hath a reference to my state no longer celia but aliena
but cousin what if we assay d to steal the clownish fool out of your father s court
would he not be a comfort to our travel
he ll go along o er the wide world with me leave me alone to woo him
let s away and get our jewels and our wealth together devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight
now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment
the forest of arden enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords like foresters duke senior
now my co mates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp
are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court
here feel we not the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter s wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am
sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything
happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style
come shall we go and kill us venison
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gor d
indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish d you
to day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood
to the which place a poor sequest red stag that from the hunter s aim had ta en a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heav d forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears cours d one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears
did he not moralize this spectacle
o yes into a thousand similes
first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou mak st a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much
then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company
anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him
ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion
wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there
thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what s worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign d and native dwelling place
and did you leave him in this contemplation
we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer
show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then he s full of matter
i ll bring you to him straight
the duke s palace enter duke frederick with lords frederick
can it be possible that no man saw them
it cannot be some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this
i cannot hear of any that did see her
the ladies her attendants of her chamber saw her abed and in the morning early they found the bed untreasur d of their mistress
my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
hisperia the princess gentlewoman confesses that she secretly o erheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles and she believes wherever they are gone that youth is surely in their company
send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
if he be absent bring his brother to me i ll make him find him
do this suddenly and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways
before oliver s house enter orlando and adam meeting orlando
o you memory of old sir rowland
and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny prizer of the humorous duke
your praise is come too swiftly home before you
know you not master to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies
your virtues gentle master are sanctified and holy traitors to you
o what a world is this when what is comely envenoms him that bears it
come not within these doors within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives
your brother no no brother yet the son yet not the son i will not call him son of him i was about to call his father hath heard your praises and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie and you within it
if he fail of that he will have other means to cut you off i overheard him and his practices
this is no place this house is but a butchery abhor it fear it do not enter it
why whither adam wouldst thou have me go
no matter whither so you come not here
what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food or with a base and boist rous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road
this i must do or know not what to do yet this i will not do do how i can
i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother
i have five hundred crowns the thrifty hire i sav d under your father which i did store to be my foster nurse when service should in my old limbs lie lame and unregarded age in corners thrown
take that and he that doth the ravens feed yea providently caters for the sparrow be comfort to my age
here is the gold all this i give you
let me be your servant though i look old yet i am strong and lusty for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility therefore my age is as a lusty winter frosty but kindly
let me go with you i ll do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities
o good old man how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world when service sweat for duty not for meed
thou art not for the fashion of these times where none will sweat but for promotion and having that do choke their service up even with the having it is not so with thee
but poor old man thou prun st a rotten tree that cannot so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
but come thy ways we ll go along together and ere we have thy youthful wages spent we ll light upon some settled low content
master go on and i will follow the to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
from seventeen years till now almost four score here lived i but now live here no more
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek but at fourscore it is too late a week yet fortune cannot recompense me better than to die well and not my master s debtor
the forest of arden enter rosalind for ganymede celia for aliena and clown alias touchstone rosalind
o jupiter how weary are my spirits
i care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
i could find in my heart to disgrace my man s apparel and to cry like a woman but i must comfort the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage good aliena
i pray you bear with me i cannot go no further
for my part i had rather bear with you than bear you yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you for i think you have no money in your purse
this is the forest of arden
ay now am i in arden the more fool i when i was at home i was in a better place but travellers must be content
look you who comes here a young man and an old in solemn talk
that is the way to make her scorn you still
o corin that thou knew st how i do love her
i partly guess for i have lov d ere now
no corin being old thou canst not guess though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sigh d upon a midnight pillow
but if thy love were ever like to mine as sure i think did never man love so how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
into a thousand that i have forgotten
o thou didst then never love so heartily
if thou rememb rest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into thou hast not lov d or if thou hast not sat as i do now wearing thy hearer in thy mistress praise thou hast not lov d or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly as my passion now makes me thou hast not lov d
searching of thy wound i have by hard adventure found mine own
i remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a night to jane smile and i remember the kissing of her batler and the cow s dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk d and i remember the wooing of peascod instead of her from whom i took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears wear these for my sake
we that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
thou speak st wiser than thou art ware of
nay i shall ne er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it
this shepherd s passion is much upon my fashion
and mine but it grows something stale with me
i pray you one of you question yond man if he for gold will give us any food i faint almost to death
peace fool he s not thy ensman
and to you gentle sir and to you all
i prithee shepherd if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
here s a young maid with travel much oppress d and faints for succour
fair sir i pity her and wish for her sake more than for mine own my fortunes were more able to relieve her but i am shepherd to another man and do not shear the fleeces that i graze
my master is of churlish disposition and little recks to find the way to heaven by doing deeds of hospitality
besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed are now on sale and at our sheepcote now by reason of his absence there is nothing that you will feed on but what is come see and in my voice most welcome shall you be
what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
that young swain that you saw here but erewhile that little cares for buying any thing
i pray thee if it stand with honesty buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock and thou shalt have to pay for it of us
and we will mend thy wages
i like this place and willingly could waste my time in it
assuredly the thing is to be sold
go with me if you like upon report the soil the profit and this kind of life i will your very faithful feeder be and buy it with your gold right suddenly
exeunt scene v another part of the forest enter amiens jaques and others song amiens
under the greenwood tree who loves to lie with me and turn his merry note unto the sweet bird s throat come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather
it will make you melancholy monsieur jaques
i can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
my voice is ragged i know i cannot please you
i do not desire you to please me i do desire you to sing
nay i care not for their names they owe me nothing
more at your request than to please myself
well then if ever i thank any man i ll thank you but that they call compliment is like th encounter of two dog apes and when a man thanks me heartily methinks have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks
come sing and you that will not hold your tongues
well i ll end the song
sirs cover the while the duke will drink under this tree
he hath been all this day to look you
and i have been all this day to avoid him
he is to disputable for my company
i think of as many matters as he but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them
song all together here who doth ambition shun and loves to live i th sun seeking the food he eats and pleas d with what he gets come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather
i ll give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention
thus it goes if it do come to pass that any man turn ass leaving his wealth and ease a stubborn will to please ducdame ducdame ducdame here shall he see gross fools as he an if he will come to me
tis a greek invocation to call fools into a circle
i ll go sleep if i can if i cannot i ll rail against all the first born of egypt
and i ll go seek the duke his banquet is prepar d
the forest enter orlando and adam adam
dear master i can go no further
here lie i down and measure out my grave
live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little
if this uncouth forest yield anything savage i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee
thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers
for my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arm s end
i will here be with the presently and if i bring thee not something to eat i will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before i come thou art a mocker of my labour
thou look st cheerly and i ll be with thee quickly
yet thou liest in the bleak air
come i will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert
the forest a table set out
enter duke senior amiens and lords like outlaws duke senior
i think he be transform d into a beast for i can nowhere find him like a man
my lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song
if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
go seek him tell him i would speak with him
he saves my labour by his own approach
what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company
i met a fool i th forest a motley fool
as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and bask d him in the sun and rail d on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool
good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lack lustre eye says very wisely it is ten o clock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale
when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial
one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places cramm d with observation the which he vents in mangled forms
o that i were a fool
i am ambitious for a motley coat
it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise
i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh
and why sir must they so
the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise man s folly is anatomiz d even by the squand ring glances of the fool
invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine
i can tell what thou wouldst do
what for a counter would i do but good
most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all th embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the wearer s very means do ebb
what woman in the city do i name when that i say the city woman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour
or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech
let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong d him if it do him right then he hath wrong d himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild goose flies unclaim d of any man
enter orlando with his sword drawn orlando
why i have eat none yet
nor shalt not till necessity be serv d
of what kind should this cock come of
art thou thus bolden d man by thy distress
or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seem st so empty
you touch d my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath ta en from me the show of smooth civility yet arn i inland bred and know some nurture
but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered
an you will not be answer d with reason i must die
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness
i almost die for food and let me have it
sit down and feed and welcome to our table
pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment
but whate er you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have look d on better days if ever been where bells have knoll d to church if ever sat at any good man s feast if ever from your eyelids wip d a tear and know what tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword
true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knoll d to church and sat at good men s feasts and wip d our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engend red and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minist red
then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food
there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limp d in pure love till he be first suffic d oppress d with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit
and we will nothing waste till you return
i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in
all the world s a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages
at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurse s arms then the whining school boy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school
and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow
then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon s mouth
and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lin d with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part
the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper d pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well sav d a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound
last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing
re enter orlando with adam duke senior
i thank you most for him
so had you need i scarce can speak to thank you for myself
i will not trouble you as yet to question you about your fortunes
give us some music and good cousin sing
song blow blow thou winter wind thou art not so unkind as man s ingratitude thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
freeze freeze thou bitter sky that dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp thy sting is not so sharp as friend rememb red not
if that you were the good sir rowland s son as you have whisper d faithfully you were and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limn d and living in your face be truly welcome hither
i am the duke that lov d your father
the residue of your fortune go to my cave and tell me
good old man thou art right welcome as thy master is

the palace enter duke frederick oliver and lords frederick
but were i not the better part made mercy i should not seek an absent argument of my revenge thou present
but look to it find out thy brother wheresoe er he is seek him with candle bring him dead or living within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory
thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine worth seizure do we seize into our hands till thou canst quit thee by thy brother s mouth of what we think against thee
o that your highness knew my heart in this
i never lov d my brother in my life
well push him out of doors and let my officers of such a nature make an extent upon his house and lands
do this expediently and turn him going
the forest enter orlando with a paper orlando
hang there my verse in witness of my love and thou thrice crowned queen of night survey with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
these trees shall be my books and in their barks my thoughts i ll character that every eye which in this forest looks shall see thy virtue witness d every where
run run orlando carve on every tree the fair the chaste and unexpressive she
exit enter corin and touchstone corin
and how like you this shepherd s life master touchstone
truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd s life it is nought
in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life
now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious
as it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach
hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred
such a one is a natural philosopher
truly thou art damn d like an ill roasted egg all on one side
why if thou never wast at court thou never saw st good manners if thou never saw st good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation
thou art in a parlous state shepherd
those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court
you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy
why do not your courtier s hands sweat
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man
a better instance i say come
your lips will feel them the sooner
and they are often tarr d over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar
the courtier s hands are perfum d with civet
thou worm s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed
learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat
you have too courtly a wit for me i ll rest
sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get that i wear owe no man hate envy no man s happiness glad of other men s good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck
that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell wether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked pated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match
if thou beest not damn d for this the devil himself will have no shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst scape
here comes young master ganymede my new mistress s brother
enter rosalind reading a paper rosalind
from the east to western inde no jewel is like rosalinde
her worth being mounted on the wind through all the world bears rosalinde
all the pictures fairest lin d are but black to rosalinde
let no face be kept in mind but the fair of rosalinde
i ll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted
it is the right butter women s rank to market
for a taste if a hart do lack a hind let him seek out rosalinde
if the cat will after kind so be sure will rosalinde
winter garments must be lin d so must slender rosalinde
they that reap must sheaf and bind then to cart with rosalinde
sweetest nut hath sourest rind such a nut is rosalinde
he that sweetest rose will find must find love s prick and rosalinde
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them
i found them on a tree
truly the tree yields bad fruit
i ll graff it with you and then i shall graff it with a medlar
then it will be the earliest fruit i th country for you ll be rotten ere you be half ripe and that s the right virtue of the medlar
you have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judge
enter celia with a writing rosalind
here comes my sister reading stand aside
why should this a desert be
no tongues i ll hang on every tree that shall civil sayings show
some how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage that the streching of a span buckles in his sum of age some of violated vows twixt the souls of friend and friend but upon the fairest boughs or at every sentence end will i rosalinda write teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show
therefore heaven nature charg d that one body should be fill d with all graces wide enlarg d
nature presently distill d helen s cheek but not her heart cleopatra s majesty atalanta s better part sad lucretia s modesty
thus rosalinde of many parts by heavenly synod was devis d of many faces eyes and hearts to have the touches dearest priz d
heaven would that she these gifts should have and i to live and die her slave
what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried have patience good people
back friends shepherd go off a little go with him sirrah
come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
o yes i heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
that s no matter the feet might bear the verses
ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hang d and carved upon these trees
i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what i found on a palm tree
i was never so berhym d since pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember
trow you who hath done this
and a chain that you once wore about his neck
it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be remov d with earthquakes and so encounter
nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is
o wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping
dost thou think though i am caparison d like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition
one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery
i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace
i would thou could st stammer that thou mightst pour this conceal d man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrow mouth d bottle either too much at once or none at all
i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings
so you may put a man in your belly
is he of god s making
is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
nay he hath but a little beard
why god will send more if the man will be thankful
let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
it is young orlando that tripp d up the wrestler s heels and your heart both in an instant
nay but the devil take mocking
speak sad brow and true maid
what shall i do with my doublet and hose
what did he when thou saw st him
and when shalt thou see him again
you must borrow me gargantua s mouth first tis a word too great for any mouth of this age s size
to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism
but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man s apparel
looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance
i found him under a tree like a dropp d acorn
it may well be call d jove s tree when it drops forth such fruit
there lay he stretch d along like a wounded knight
though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground
cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets unseasonably
he was furnish d like a hunter
he comes to kill my heart
i would sing my song without a burden thou bring st me out of tune
do you not know i am a woman
when i think i must speak
tis he slink by and note him
i thank you for your company but good faith i had as lief have been myself alone
and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you too for your society
god buy you let s meet as little as we can
i do desire we may be better strangers
i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks
i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favouredly
rosalind is your love s name
i do not like her name
there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen d
just as high as my heart
you are full of pretty answers
have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conn d them out of rings
not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions
you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalanta s heels
will you sit down with me
and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery
i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults
the worst fault you have is to be in love
tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you
he is drown d in the brook look but in and you shall see him
there i shall see mine own figure
which i take to be either a fool or a cipher
i ll tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love
i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy
aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him do you hear forester
i pray you what is t o clock
you should ask me what time o day there s no clock in the forest
then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock
and why not the swift foot of time
had not that been as proper
time travels in divers paces with divers persons
i ll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal
i prithee who doth he trot withal
marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz d if the interim be but a se nnight time s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year
with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury
with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves
with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
are you native of this place
as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling
i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love
i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touch d with so many giddy offences as he hath generally tax d their whole sex withal
can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women
there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it
i prithee recount some of them
no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick
there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind
if i could meet that fancy monger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him
i am he that is so love shak d i pray you tell me your remedy
there is none of my uncle s marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner
a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother s revenue
then your hose should be ungarter d your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbutton d your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation
but you are no such man you are rather point device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love
you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does
that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences
but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired
i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he
but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punish d and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too
yet i profess curing it by counsel
did you ever cure any so
yes one and in this manner
and thus i cur d him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep s heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t
i would not be cured youth
i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me
now by the faith of my love i will
go with me to it and i ll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live
with all my heart good youth
nay you must call me rosalind
the forest enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind touchstone
come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats audrey
and how audrey am i the man yet
doth my simple feature content you
i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths
aside o knowledge ill inhabited worse than jove in a thatch d house
when a man s verses cannot be understood nor a man s good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room
truly i would the gods had made thee poetical
i do not know what poetical is
is it honest in deed and word
no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
i do truly for thou swear st to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign
would you not have me honest
no truly unless thou wert hard favour d for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest
truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish
i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul
well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter
but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promis d to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us
aside i would fain see this meeting
well the gods give us joy
a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn beasts
as horns are odious they are necessary
it is said many a man knows no end of his goods
many a man has good horns and knows no end of them
well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting
no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal
is the single man therefore blessed
no as a wall d town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want
enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext you are well met
will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel
is there none here to give the woman
i will not take her on gift of any man
truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
discovering himself proceed proceed i ll give her
good even good master what ye call t how do you sir
goddild you for your last company
i am very glad to see you
even a toy in hand here sir
as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar
get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife
go thou with me and let me counsel thee
come sweet audrey we must be married or we must live in bawdry
not o sweet oliver o brave oliver leave me not behind thee
but wind away begone i say i will not to wedding with thee
exeunt jaques touchstone and audrey martext
tis no matter ne er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling
the forest enter rosalind and celia rosalind
never talk to me i will weep
do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man
but have i not cause to weep
as good cause as one would desire therefore weep
his very hair is of the dissembling colour
marry his kisses are judas s own children
i faith his hair is of a good colour
an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread
he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana
a nun of winter s sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them
but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not
nay certainly there is no truth in him
yes i think he is not a pick purse nor a horse stealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as covered goblet or a worm eaten nut
yes when he is in but i think he is not in
you have heard him swear downright he was
was is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings
he attends here in the forest on the duke your father
i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him
he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laugh d and let me go
but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando
o that s a brave man
he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose
but all s brave that youth mounts and folly guides
mistress and master you have oft enquired after the shepherd that complain d of love who you saw sitting by me on the turf praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress
if you will see a pageant truly play d between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain go hence a little and i shall conduct you if you will mark it
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
bring us to this sight and you shall say i ll prove a busy actor in their play
exeunt scene v another part of the forest enter silvius and phebe silvius
sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
say that you love me not but say not so in bitterness
the common executioner whose heart th accustom d sight of death makes hard falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon
will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
enter rosalind celia and corin at a distance phebe
i would not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee
thou tell st me there is murder in mine eye
tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frail st and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be call d tyrants butchers murderers
now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is not force in eyes that can do hurt
o dear phebe if ever as that ever may be near you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that love s keen arrows make
but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee
advancing and why i pray you
who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched
what though you have no beauty as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless
why do you look on me
i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature s sale work
od s my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too
no faith proud mistress hope not after it tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship
you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman
tis such fools as you that makes the world full of ill favour d children
tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her
down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good man s love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets
cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
so take her to thee shepherd
sweet youth i pray you chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo
he s fall n in love with your foulness and she ll fall in love with my anger
if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks i ll sauce her with bitter words
why look you so upon me
for no ill will i bear you
i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not
if you will know my house tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
shepherdess look on him better and be not proud though all the world could see none could be so abus d in sight as he
exeunt rosalind celia and corin phebe
dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might who ever lov d that lov d not at first sight
why i arn sorry for thee gentle silvius
wherever sorrow is relief would be
if you do sorrow at my grief in love by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermin d
thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and i ll employ thee too
but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ d
so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatt red smile and that i ll live upon
know st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of
think not i love him though i ask for him tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
but what care i for words
yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
it is a pretty youth not very pretty but sure he s proud and yet his pride becomes him
he ll make a proper man
the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up
he is not very tall yet for his years he s tall his leg is but so so and yet tis well
there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mix d in his cheek twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
there be some women silvius had they mark d him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am rememb red scorn d at me
i marvel why i answer d not again but that s all one omittance is no quittance
i ll write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius
i ll write it straight the matter s in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short
the forest enter rosalind celia and jaques jaques
i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee
they say you are a melancholy fellow
i am so i do love it better than laughing
those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards
why tis good to be sad and say nothing
why then tis good to be a post
i have neither the scholar s melancholy which is emulation nor the musician s which is fantastical nor the courtier s which is proud nor the soldier s which is ambitious nor the lawyer s which is politic nor the lady s which is nice nor the lover s which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness
by my faith you have great reason to be sad
i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men s then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
yes i have gain d my experience
and your experience makes you sad
i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too
good day and happiness dear rosalind
nay then god buy you an you talk in blank verse
farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola
exit jaques why how now orlando
where have you been all this while
an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more
my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise
break an hour s promise in love
he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clapp d him o th shoulder but i ll warrant him heart whole
nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight
i had as lief be woo d of a snail
ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him
why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
virtue is no horn maker and my rosalind is virtuous
it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you
come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent
what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind
i would kiss before i spoke
nay you were better speak first and when you were gravell d for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss
very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
how if the kiss be denied
then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter
who could be out being before his beloved mistress
marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit
not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her
well in her person i say i will not have you
then in mine own person i die
the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause
troilus had his brains dash d out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love
leander he would have liv d many a fair year though hero had turn d nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drown d and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos
but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love
i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me
by this hand it will not kill a fly
but come now i will be your rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it
yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all
why then can one desire too much of a good thing
come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
you must begin will you orlando celia
will you orlando have to wife this rosalind
why now as fast as she can marry us
then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife
i take thee rosalind for wife
i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband
there s a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman s thought runs before her actions
so do all thoughts they are wing d
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possess d her
say a day without the ever
no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey
i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are dispos d to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclin d to sleep
but will my rosalind do so
by my life she will do as i do
or else she could not have the wit to do this
make the doors upon a woman s wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the key hole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney
a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say wit whither wilt
nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife s wit going to your neighbour s bed
and what wit could wit have to excuse that
marry to say she came to seek you there
you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue
o that woman that cannot make her fault her husband s occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool
for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee
alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours
i must attend the duke at dinner by two o clock i will be with thee again
ay go your ways go your ways
i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less
that flattering tongue of yours won me
tis but one cast away and so come death
two o clock is your hour
by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful
therefore beware my censure and keep your promise
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so adieu
well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try
you have simply misus d our sex in your love prate
we must have your doublet and hose pluck d over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest
o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love
but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal
or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out
no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceiv d of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every one s eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love
i ll tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando
i ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come
the forest enter jaques and lords in the habit of foresters jaques
which is he that killed the deer
let s present him to the duke like a roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deer s horns upon his head for a branch of victory
have you no song forester for this purpose
sing it tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough
what shall he have that kill d the deer
his leather skin and horns to wear
the rest shall hear this burden then sing him home
take thou no scorn to wear the horn it was a crest ere thou wast born
thy father s father wore it and thy father bore it
the horn the horn the lusty horn is not a thing to laugh to scorn
the forest enter rosalind and celia rosalind
is it not past two o clock
i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep
my errand is to you fair youth my gentle phebe did bid me give you this
i know not the contents but as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it it bears an angry tenour
pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger
patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer
she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix
her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me
well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device
no i protest i know not the contents phebe did write it
come come you are a fool and turn d into the extremity of love
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestone colour d hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but twas her hands she has a huswife s hand but that s no matter
i say she never did invent this letter this is a man s invention and his hand
why tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers
why she defies me like turk to christian
women s gentle brain could not drop forth such giant rude invention such ethiope words blacker in their effect than in their countenance
so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phebe s cruelty
she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
reads art thou god to shepherd turn d that a maiden s heart hath burn d
why thy godhead laid apart warr st thou with a woman s heart
did you ever hear such railing
whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me
if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect
whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move
he that brings this love to the little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then i ll study how to die
wilt thou love such a woman
what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee
well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her
if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company
good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheep cote fenc d about with olive trees
west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place
but at this hour the house doth keep itself there s none within
if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother
are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for
it is no boast being ask d to say we are
orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin
what must we understand by this
some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was stain d
when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell
he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself
under an oak whose boughs were moss d with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man o ergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back
about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreath d itself who with her head nimble in threats approach d the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlink d itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush s shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother
o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that liv d amongst men
and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural
but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suck d and hungry lioness
twice did he turn his back and purpos d so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awak d
was t you he rescu d
was t you that did so oft contrive to kill him
twas i but tis not i i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am
when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bath d as how i came into that desert place in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brother s love who led me instantly unto his cave there stripp d himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind
brief i recover d him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dy d in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind
many will swoon when they do look on blood
i would i were at home
i pray you will you take him by the arm
you lack a man s heart
i do so i confess it
ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited
i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited
this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest
well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right
come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards
that will i for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother rosalind
i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him
the forest enter touchstone and audrey touchstone
we shall find a time audrey patience gentle audrey
faith the priest was good enough for all the old gentleman s saying
a most wicked sir oliver audrey a most vile martext
but audrey there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you
ay i know who tis he hath no interest in me in the world here comes the man you mean
it is meat and drink to me to see a clown
by my troth we that have good wits have much to answer for we shall be flouting we cannot hold
god ye good ev n william
and good ev n to you sir
cover thy head cover thy head nay prithee be cover d
wast born i th forest here
so so is good very good very excellent good and yet it is not it is but so so
ay sir i have a pretty wit
i do now remember a saying the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
the heathen philosopher when he had a desire to eat a grape would open his lips when he put it into his mouth meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open
then learn this of me to have is to have for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink being pour d out of cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty the other for all your writers do consent that ipse is he now you are not ipse for i am he
he sir that must marry this woman
therefore you clown abandon which is in the vulgar leave the society which in the boorish is company of this female which in the common is woman which together is abandon the society of this female or clown thou perishest or to thy better understanding diest or to wit i kill thee make thee away translate thy life into death thy liberty into bondage
i will deal in poison with thee or in bastinado or in steel i will bandy with thee in faction will o er run thee with policy i will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways therefore tremble and depart
our master and mistress seeks you come away away
the forest enter orlando and oliver orlando
is t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her
that but seeing you should love her
and will you persever to enjoy her
neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me i love aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other
it shall be to your good for my father s house and all the revenue that was old sir rowland s will i estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd
let your wedding be to morrow
thither will i invite the duke and all s contented followers
go you and prepare aliena for look you here comes my rosalind
o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion
wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady
did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he show d me your handkercher
ay and greater wonders than that
o i know where you are
there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar s thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame
for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look d no sooner look d but they lov d no sooner lov d but they sigh d no sooner sigh d but they ask d one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage
they are in the very wrath of love and they will together
they shall be married to morrow and i will bid the duke to the nuptial
but o how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man s eyes
by so much the more shall i to morrow be at the height of heart heaviness by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
why then to morrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind
i can live no longer by thinking
i will weary you then no longer with idle talking
know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit
i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me
believe then if you please that i can do strange things
i have since i was three year old convers d with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable
if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her
i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes to morrow human as she is and without any danger
speak st thou in sober meanings
by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician
therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married to morrow you shall and to rosalind if you will
enter silvius and phebe look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers
youth you have done me much ungentleness to show the letter that i writ to you
i care not if i have
it is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you
you are there follow d by a faithful shepherd look upon him love him he worships you
good shepherd tell this youth what tis to love
it is to be all made of sighs and tears and so am i for phebe
it is to be all made of faith and service and so am i for phebe
it is to be all made of fantasy all made of passion and all made of wishes all adoration duty and observance all humbleness all patience and impatience all purity all trial all obedience and so am i for phebe
and so am i for ganymede
and so am i for rosalind
and so am i for no woman
if this be so why blame you me to love you
if this be so why blame you me to love you
if this be so why blame you me to love you
why do you speak too why blame you me to love you
to her that is not here nor doth not hear
pray you no more of this tis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon
to silvius i will help you if i can
to phebe i would love you if i could to morrow meet me all together
to phebe i will marry you if ever i marry woman and i ll be married to morrow
to orlando i will satisfy you if ever i satisfied man and you shall be married to morrow
to silvius i will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married to morrow
to orlando as you love rosalind meet
to silvius as you love phebe meet and as i love no woman i ll meet
so fare you well i have left you commands
i ll not fail if i live
the forest enter touchstone and audrey touchstone
to morrow is the joyful day audre y to morrow will we be married
i do desire it with all my heart and i hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world
here come two of the banish d duke s pages
come sit sit and a song
we are for you sit i th middle
shall we clap into t roundly without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues to a bad voice
i faith i faith and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse
it was a lover and his lass with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino that o er the green corn field did pass in the spring time the only pretty ring time when birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
between the acres of the rye with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino these pretty country folks would lie in the spring time c this carol they began that hour with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino how that a life was but a flower in the spring time c and therefore take the present time with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino for love is crowned with the prime in the spring time c touchstone
truly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneable
you are deceiv d sir we kept time we lost not our time
by my troth yes i count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song
god buy you and god mend your voices
the forest enter duke senior amiens jaques orlando oliver and celia duke senior
dost thou believe orlando that the boy can do all this that he hath promised
i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not as those that fear they hope and know they fear
enter rosalind silvius and phebe rosalind
patience once more whiles our compact is urg d you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here
that would i had i kingdoms to give with her
and you say you will have her when i bring her
that would i were i of all kingdoms king
you say you ll marry me if i be willing
that will i should i die the hour after
but if you do refuse to marry me you ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd
you say that you ll have phebe if she will
though to have her and death were both one thing
i have promis d to make all this matter even
keep you your word o duke to give your daughter you yours orlando to receive his daughter keep your word phebe that you ll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd keep your word silvius that you ll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even
exeunt rosalind and celia duke senior
i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter s favour
my lord the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter
but my good lord this boy is forest born and hath been tutor d in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle whom he reports to be a great magician obscured in the circle of this forest
there is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark
here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are call d fools
salutation and greeting to you all
good my lord bid him welcome
this is the motley minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest
he hath been a courtier he swears
if any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation
i have trod a measure i have flatt red a lady i have been politic with my friend smooth with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have had four quarrels and like to have fought one
and how was that ta en up
faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause
good my lord like this fellow
god ild you sir i desire you of the like
i press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks
a poor virgin sir an ill favour d thing sir but mine own a poor humour of mine sir to take that that man else will
rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster
by my faith he is very swift and sententious
according to the fool s bolt sir and such dulcet diseases
but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause
upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming audrey as thus sir
i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier s beard he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was
this is call d the retort courteous
if i sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself
this is call d the quip modest
if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment
this is call d the reply churlish
if again it was not well cut he would answer i spake not true
this is call d the reproof valiant
if again it was not well cut he would say i lie
this is call d the countercheck quarrelsome
and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct
and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we measur d swords and parted
can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners
i will name you the degrees
the first the retort courteous the second the quip modest the third the reply churlish the fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the countercheck quarrelsome the sixth the lie with circumstance the seventh the lie direct
all these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an if
i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an if as if you said so then i said so
and they shook hands and swore brothers
your if is the only peace maker much virtue in if
is not this a rare fellow my lord
he s as good at any thing and yet a fool
he uses his folly like a stalking horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit enter hymen rosalind and celia
then is there mirth in heaven when earthly things made even atone together
good duke receive thy daughter hymen from heaven brought her yea brought her hither that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within his bosom is
to duke to you i give myself for i am yours
to orlando to you i give myself for i am yours
if there be truth in sight you are my daughter
if there be truth in sight you are my rosalind
if sight and shape be true why then my love adieu
i ll have no father if you be not he i ll have no husband if you be not he nor ne er wed woman if you be not she
i bar confusion tis i must make conclusion of these most strange events
here s eight that must take hands to join in hymen s bands if truth holds true contents
you and you no cross shall part you and you are heart in heart you to his love must accord or have a woman to your lord you and you are sure together as the winter to foul weather
whiles a wedlock hymn we sing feed yourselves with questioning that reason wonder may diminish how thus we met and these things finish
song wedding is great juno s crown o blessed bond of board and bed
tis hymen peoples every town high wedlock then be honoured
honour high honour and renown to hymen god of every town
o my dear niece welcome thou art to me
even daughter welcome in no less degree
i will not eat my word now thou art mine thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine
enter jaques de boys jaques de boys
let me have audience for a word or two
i am the second son of old sir rowland that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
duke frederick hearing how that every day men of great worth resorted to this forest address d a mighty power which were on foot in his own conduct purposely to take his brother here and put him to the sword and to the skirts of this wild wood he came where meeting with an old religious man after some question with him was converted both from his enterprise and from the world his crown bequeathing to his banish d brother and all their lands restor d to them again that were with him exil d
this to be true i do engage my life
thou offer st fairly to thy brothers wedding to one his lands withheld and to the other a land itself at large a potent dukedom
first in this forest let us do those ends that here were well begun and well begot and after every of this happy number that have endur d shrewd days and nights with us shall share the good of our returned fortune according to the measure of their states
meantime forget this new fall n dignity and fall into our rustic revelry
play music and you brides and bridegrooms all with measure heap d in joy to th measures fall
if i heard you rightly the duke hath put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court
out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learn d
to duke you to your former honour i bequeath your patience and your virtue well deserves it
to orlando you to a love that your true faith doth merit to oliver you to your land and love and great allies to silvius you to a long and well deserved bed to touchstone and you to wrangling for thy loving voyage is but for two months victuall d so to your pleasures i am for other than for dancing measures
what you would have i ll stay to know at your abandon d cave
we will begin these rites as we do trust they ll end in true delights
it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue
if it be true that good wine needs no bush tis true that a good play needs no epilogue
yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues
what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play
i am not furnish d like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me
my way is to conjure you and i ll begin with the women
i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simp ring none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please
if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas d me complexions that lik d me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell

i am not partial to infringe our laws
the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants our well dealing countrymen who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks
for since the mortal and intestine jars ’twixt thy seditious countrymen and us it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay more if any born at ephesus be seen at syracusian marts and fairs again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus he dies his goods confiscate to the duke’s dispose unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him
thy substance valued at the highest rate cannot amount unto a hundred marks therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die
yet this my comfort when your words are done my woes end likewise with the evening sun
well syracusian say in brief the cause why thou departedst from thy native home and for what cause thou cam’st to ephesus
a heavier task could not have been impos’d than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature not by vile offence i’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
in syracusa was i born and wed unto a woman happy but for me and by me had not our hap been bad
with her i liv’d in joy our wealth increas’d by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum till my factor’s death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was
there had she not been long but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons and which was strange the one so like the other as could not be distinguish’d but by names
that very hour and in the self same inn a mean woman was delivered of such a burden male twins both alike
those for their parents were exceeding poor i bought and brought up to attend my sons
my wife not meanly proud of two such boys made daily motions for our home return
unwilling i agreed alas too soon we came aboard
a league from epidamnum had we sail’d before the always wind obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death which though myself would gladly have embrac’d yet the incessant weepings of my wife weeping before for what she saw must come and piteous plainings of the pretty babes that mourn’d for fashion ignorant what to fear forc’d me to seek delays for them and me
and this it was for other means was none
the sailors sought for safety by our boat and left the ship then sinking ripe to us
my wife more careful for the latter born had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast such as sea faring men provide for storms
to him one of the other twins was bound whilst i had been like heedful of the other
the children thus dispos’d my wife and i fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast and floating straight obedient to the stream was carried towards corinth as we thought
at length the sun gazing upon the earth dispers’d those vapours that offended us and by the benefit of his wished light the seas wax’d calm and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us of corinth that of epidaurus this
but ere they came—o let me say no more
gather the sequel by that went before
nay forward old man do not break off so for we may pity though not pardon thee
o had the gods done so i had not now worthily term’d them merciless to us
for ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues we were encountered by a mighty rock which being violently borne upon our helpful ship was splitted in the midst so that in this unjust divorce of us fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in what to sorrow for
her part poor soul seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe was carried with more speed before the wind and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth as we thought
at length another ship had seiz’d on us and knowing whom it was their hap to save gave healthful welcome to their ship wrack’d guests and would have reft the fishers of their prey had not their bark been very slow of sail and therefore homeward did they bend their course
thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss that by misfortunes was my life prolong’d to tell sad stories of my own mishaps
and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for do me the favour to dilate at full what have befall’n of them and thee till now
my youngest boy and yet my eldest care at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importun’d me that his attendant so his case was like reft of his brother but retain’d his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i laboured of a love to see i hazarded the loss of whom i lov’d
five summers have i spent in farthest greece roaming clean through the bounds of asia and coasting homeward came to ephesus hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men
but here must end the story of my life and happy were i in my timely death could all my travels warrant me they live
hapless egeon whom the fates have mark’d to bear the extremity of dire mishap now trust me were it not against our laws against my crown my oath my dignity which princes would they may not disannul my soul should sue as advocate for thee
but though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recall’d but to our honour’s great disparagement yet will i favour thee in what i can
therefore merchant i’ll limit thee this day to seek thy health by beneficial help
try all the friends thou hast in ephesus beg thou or borrow to make up the sum and live if no then thou art doom’d to die
jailer take him to thy custody
hopeless and helpless doth egeon wend but to procrastinate his lifeless end
enter antipholus and dromio of syracuse and a merchant
therefore give out you are of epidamnum lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
this very day a syracusian merchant is apprehended for arrival here and not being able to buy out his life according to the statute of the town dies ere the weary sun set in the west
there is your money that i had to keep
go bear it to the centaur where we host and stay there dromio till i come to thee
within this hour it will be dinnertime till that i’ll view the manners of the town peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings and then return and sleep within mine inn for with long travel i am stiff and weary
many a man would take you at your word and go indeed having so good a mean
a trusty villain sir that very oft when i am dull with care and melancholy lightens my humour with his merry jests
what will you walk with me about the town and then go to my inn and dine with me
i am invited sir to certain merchants of whom i hope to make much benefit
soon at five o’clock please you i’ll meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till bedtime
my present business calls me from you now
farewell till then i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city
sir i commend you to your own content
he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i cannot get
i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop who failing there to find his fellow forth unseen inquisitive confounds himself
so i to find a mother and a brother in quest of them unhappy lose myself
here comes the almanac of my true date
how chance thou art return’d so soon
the capon burns the pig falls from the spit the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell my mistress made it one upon my cheek
she is so hot because the meat is cold the meat is cold because you come not home you come not home because you have no stomach you have no stomach having broke your fast but we that know what ’tis to fast and pray are penitent for your default today
stop in your wind sir tell me this i pray where have you left the money that i gave you
o sixpence that i had o’ wednesday last to pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper the saddler had it sir i kept it not
i am not in a sportive humour now
tell me and dally not where is the money
we being strangers here how dar’st thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody
i pray you jest sir as you sit at dinner i from my mistress come to you in post if i return i shall be post indeed for she will score your fault upon my pate
methinks your maw like mine should be your clock and strike you home without a messenger
come dromio come these jests are out of season reserve them till a merrier hour than this
where is the gold i gave in charge to thee
why you gave no gold to me
come on sir knave have done your foolishness and tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge
my charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house the phoenix sir to dinner
my mistress and her sister stay for you
now as i am a christian answer me in what safe place you have bestow’d my money or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undispos’d where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me
i have some marks of yours upon my pate some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders but not a thousand marks between you both
if i should pay your worship those again perchance you will not bear them patiently
your worship’s wife my mistress at the phoenix she that doth fast till you come home to dinner and prays that you will hie you home to dinner
what wilt thou flout me thus unto my face being forbid
there take you that sir knave
for god’s sake hold your hands
nay an you will not sir i’ll take my heels
upon my life by some device or other the villain is o’er raught of all my money
they say this town is full of cozenage as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye dark working sorcerers that change the mind soul killing witches that deform the body disguised cheaters prating mountebanks and many such like liberties of sin if it prove so i will be gone the sooner
i’ll to the centaur to go seek this slave
i greatly fear my money is not safe
enter adriana wife to antipholus of ephesus with luciana her sister
neither my husband nor the slave return’d that in such haste i sent to seek his master
sure luciana it is two o’clock
perhaps some merchant hath invited him and from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner
good sister let us dine and never fret a man is master of his liberty time is their master and when they see time they’ll go or come
why should their liberty than ours be more
because their business still lies out o’ door
look when i serve him so he takes it ill luciana
o know he is the bridle of your will
there’s none but asses will be bridled so
why headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe
there’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye but hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls are their males’ subjects and at their controls
man more divine the masters of all these lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas indued with intellectual sense and souls of more pre eminence than fish and fowls are masters to their females and their lords then let your will attend on their accords
this servitude makes you to keep unwed
not this but troubles of the marriage bed
but were you wedded you would bear some sway
ere i learn love i’ll practise to obey
how if your husband start some other where
till he come home again i would forbear
no marvel though she pause they can be meek that have no other cause
a wretched soul bruis’d with adversity we bid be quiet when we hear it cry but were we burd’ned with like weight of pain as much or more we should ourselves complain so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee with urging helpless patience would relieve me but if thou live to see like right bereft this fool begg’d patience in thee will be left
well i will marry one day but to try
here comes your man now is your husband nigh
say is your tardy master now at hand
nay he’s at two hands with me and that my two ears can witness
say didst thou speak with him
ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
beshrew his hand i scarce could understand it
spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning
nay he struck so plainly i could too well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce understand them
but say i prithee is he coming home
it seems he hath great care to please his wife
why mistress sure my master is horn mad
i mean not cuckold mad but sure he’s stark mad
when i desir’d him to come home to dinner he ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold
“’tis dinner time ” quoth i
“your meat doth burn” quoth i
“will you come home ” quoth i
“where is the thousand marks i gave thee villain ” “the pig” quoth i “is burn’d”
“my mistress sir ” quoth i
“hang up thy mistress i know not thy mistress out on thy mistress ” luciana
“i know ” quoth he “no house no wife no mistress ” so that my errand due unto my tongue i thank him i bare home upon my shoulders for in conclusion he did beat me there
go back again thou slave and fetch him home
go back again and be new beaten home
for god’s sake send some other messenger
back slave or i will break thy pate across
and he will bless that cross with other beating
between you i shall have a holy head
am i so round with you as you with me that like a football you do spurn me thus
you spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
if i last in this service you must case me in leather
fie how impatience loureth in your face
his company must do his minions grace whilst i at home starve for a merry look
hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took from my poor cheek
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr’d unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
do their gay vestments his affections bait
that’s not my fault he’s master of my state
what ruins are in me that can be found by him not ruin’d
then is he the ground of my defeatures
my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair but too unruly deer he breaks the pale and feeds from home poor i am but his stale
unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere or else what lets it but he would be here
sister you know he promis’d me a chain would that alone a love he would detain so he would keep fair quarter with his bed
i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still that others touch yet often touching will wear gold and no man that hath a name by falsehood and corruption doth it shame
since that my beauty cannot please his eye i’ll weep what’s left away and weeping die
how many fond fools serve mad jealousy
the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur and the heedful slave is wander’d forth in care to seek me out
by computation and mine host’s report
i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart
as you love strokes so jest with me again
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
my house was at the phoenix
wast thou mad that thus so madly thou didst answer me
when spake i such a word
even now even here not half an hour since
i did not see you since you sent me hence home to the centaur with the gold you gave me
villain thou didst deny the gold’s receipt and told’st me of a mistress and a dinner for which i hope thou felt’st i was displeas’d
i am glad to see you in this merry vein
what means this jest i pray you master tell me
yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
hold take thou that and that
hold sir for god’s sake now your jest is earnest
upon what bargain do you give it me
because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours
when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport but creep in crannies when he hides his beams
if you will jest with me know my aspect and fashion your demeanour to my looks or i will beat this method in your sconce
so you would leave battering i had rather have it a head
and you use these blows long i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders
but i pray sir why am i beaten
nothing sir but that i am beaten
ay sir and wherefore for they say every why hath a wherefore
why first for flouting me and then wherefore for urging it the second time to me
was there ever any man thus beaten out of season when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason
marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing
i’ll make you amends next to give you nothing for something
but say sir is it dinner time
no sir i think the meat wants that i have
in good time sir what’s that
well sir then ’twill be dry
if it be sir i pray you eat none of it
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting
well sir learn to jest in good time
there’s a time for all things
i durst have denied that before you were so choleric
marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself
there’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature
may he not do it by fine and recovery
yes to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man
why is time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement
because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit
why but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit
not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair
why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit
the plainer dealer the sooner lost
yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity
for two and sound ones too
nay not sound i pray you
nay not sure in a thing falsing
the one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge
you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things
marry and did sir namely e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature
but your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover
thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore to the world’s end will have bald followers
i knew ’twould be a bald conclusion
ay ay antipholus look strange and frown some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
i am not adriana nor thy wife
the time was once when thou unurg’d wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear that never object pleasing in thine eye that never touch well welcome to thy hand that never meat sweet savour’d in thy taste unless i spake or look’d or touch’d or carv’d to thee
how comes it now my husband o how comes it that thou art then estranged from thyself
thyself i call it being strange to me that undividable incorporate am better than thy dear self’s better part
ah do not tear away thyself from me for know my love as easy mayst thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf and take unmingled thence that drop again without addition or diminishing as take from me thyself and not me too
how dearly would it touch thee to the quick should’st thou but hear i were licentious
and that this body consecrate to thee by ruffian lust should be contaminate
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me and hurl the name of husband in my face and tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow and from my false hand cut the wedding ring and break it with a deep divorcing vow
i know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
i am possess’d with an adulterate blot my blood is mingled with the crime of lust for if we two be one and thou play false i do digest the poison of thy flesh being strumpeted by thy contagion
keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed i live distain’d thou undishonoured
plead you to me fair dame
in ephesus i am but two hours old as strange unto your town as to your talk who every word by all my wit being scann’d wants wit in all one word to understand
fie brother how the world is chang’d with you
when were you wont to use my sister thus
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner
by thee and this thou didst return from him that he did buffet thee and in his blows denied my house for his me for his wife
did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
what is the course and drift of your compact
i never saw her till this time
villain thou liest for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart
i never spake with her in all my life
how can she thus then call us by our names
how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave abetting him to thwart me in my mood be it my wrong you are from me exempt but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
come i will fasten on this sleeve of thine
thou art an elm my husband i a vine whose weakness married to thy stronger state makes me with thy strength to communicate if aught possess thee from me it is dross usurping ivy brier or idle moss who all for want of pruning with intrusion infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
to me she speaks she moves me for her theme
what was i married to her in my dream
or sleep i now and think i hear all this
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss
until i know this sure uncertainty i’ll entertain the offer’d fallacy
dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
i cross me for a sinner
this is the fairy land o spite of spites
we talk with goblins owls and sprites if we obey them not this will ensue they’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not
dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
i am transformed master am i not
i think thou art in mind and so am i dromio of syracuse
nay master both in mind and in my shape
if thou art chang’d to aught ’tis to an ass
’tis true she rides me and i long for grass
’tis so i am an ass else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me
come come no longer will i be a fool to put the finger in the eye and weep whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn
come sir to dinner dromio keep the gate
husband i’ll dine above with you today and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
sirrah if any ask you for your master say he dines forth and let no creature enter
come sister dromio play the porter well
am i in earth in heaven or in hell
sleeping or waking mad or well advis’d
known unto these and to myself disguis’d
i’ll say as they say and persever so and in this mist at all adventures go
master shall i be porter at the gate
ay and let none enter lest i break your pate
come come antipholus we dine too late
enter antipholus of ephesus his man dromio of ephesus angelo the goldsmith and balthasar the merchant
good signior angelo you must excuse us all my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours
say that i linger’d with you at your shop to see the making of her carcanet and that tomorrow you will bring it home
but here’s a villain that would face me down
he met me on the mart and that i beat him and charg’d him with a thousand marks in gold and that i did deny my wife and house
thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this
say what you will sir but i know what i know
that you beat me at the mart i have your hand to show if the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink your own handwriting would tell you what i think
i think thou art an ass
marry so it doth appear by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear
i should kick being kick’d and being at that pass you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass
you’re sad signior balthasar pray god our cheer may answer my good will and your good welcome here
i hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear
o signior balthasar either at flesh or fish a table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish
good meat sir is common that every churl affords
and welcome more common for that’s nothing but words
balthasar small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast
ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest
but though my cates be mean take them in good part better cheer may you have but not with better heart
but soft my door is lock’d
go bid them let us in
maud bridget marian cicely gillian ginn
within mome malt horse capon coxcomb idiot patch
either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch dost thou conjure for wenches that thou call’st for such store when one is one too many
go get thee from the door
what patch is made our porter
my master stays in the street
let him walk from whence he came lest he catch cold on’s feet
right sir i’ll tell you when an you’ll tell me wherefore
nor today here you must not come again when you may
what art thou that keep’st me out from the house i owe
the porter for this time sir and my name is dromio
o villain thou hast stolen both mine office and my name the one ne’er got me credit the other mickle blame
if thou hadst been dromio today in my place thou wouldst have chang’d thy face for a name or thy name for an ass
enter luce concealed from antipholus of ephesus and his companions
within what a coil is there dromio who are those at the gate
faith no he comes too late and so tell your master
o lord i must laugh have at you with a proverb —shall i set in my staff
have at you with another that’s—when
if thy name be called luce —luce thou hast answer’d him well
you’ll let us in i hope
i thought to have ask’d you
well struck there was blow for blow
can you tell for whose sake
let him knock till it ache
you’ll cry for this minion if i beat the door down
what needs all that and a pair of stocks in the town
enter adriana concealed from antipholus of ephesus and his companions
within who is that at the door that keeps all this noise
by my troth your town is troubled with unruly boys
go get you from the door
if you went in pain master this knave would go sore
here is neither cheer sir nor welcome
in debating which was best we shall part with neither
they stand at the door master bid them welcome hither
there is something in the wind that we cannot get in
you would say so master if your garments were thin
your cake here is warm within you stand here in the cold
it would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold
go fetch me something i’ll break ope the gate
break any breaking here and i’ll break your knave’s pate
a man may break a word with you sir and words are but wind ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind
it seems thou want’st breaking out upon thee hind
here’s too much “out upon thee” i pray thee let me in
ay when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin
well i’ll break in go borrow me a crow
a crow without feather master mean you so
for a fish without a fin there’s a fowl without a feather
if a crow help us in sirrah we’ll pluck a crow together
go get thee gone fetch me an iron crow
o let it not be so herein you war against your reputation and draw within the compass of suspect the unviolated honour of your wife
once this —your long experience of her wisdom her sober virtue years and modesty plead on her part some cause to you unknown and doubt not sir but she will well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you
be rul’d by me depart in patience and let us to the tiger all to dinner and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint
if by strong hand you offer to break in now in the stirring passage of the day a vulgar comment will be made of it and that supposed by the common rout against your yet ungalled estimation that may with foul intrusion enter in and dwell upon your grave when you are dead for slander lives upon succession for ever hous’d where it gets possession
i will depart in quiet and in despite of mirth mean to be merry
i know a wench of excellent discourse pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle there will we dine
this woman that i mean my wife but i protest without desert hath oftentimes upbraided me withal to her will we to dinner —get you home and fetch the chain by this i know ’tis made
bring it i pray you to the porpentine for there’s the house
that chain will i bestow be it for nothing but to spite my wife upon mine hostess there
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me i’ll knock elsewhere to see if they’ll disdain me
i’ll meet you at that place some hour hence
do so this jest shall cost me some expense
enter luciana with antipholus of syracuse
and may it be that you have quite forgot a husband’s office
shall antipholus even in the spring of love thy love springs rot
shall love in building grow so ruinous
if you did wed my sister for her wealth then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth muffle your false love with some show of blindness
let not my sister read it in your eye be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator look sweet speak fair become disloyalty apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted teach sin the carriage of a holy saint be secret false
what simple thief brags of his own attaint
’tis double wrong to truant with your bed and let her read it in thy looks at board
shame hath a bastard fame well managed ill deeds is doubled with an evil word
alas poor women make us but believe being compact of credit that you love us
though others have the arm show us the sleeve we in your motion turn and you may move us
then gentle brother get you in again comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
’tis holy sport to be a little vain when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
sweet mistress what your name is else i know not nor by what wonder you do hit on mine less in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth’s wonder more than earth divine
teach me dear creature how to think and speak lay open to my earthy gross conceit smother’d in errors feeble shallow weak the folded meaning of your words’ deceit
against my soul’s pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field
transform me then and to your power i’ll yield
but if that i am i then well i know your weeping sister is no wife of mine nor to her bed no homage do i owe
far more far more to you do i decline
o train me not sweet mermaid with thy note to drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears
sing siren for thyself and i will dote spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs and as a bed i’ll take thee and there lie and in that glorious supposition think he gains by death that hath such means to die
let love being light be drowned if she sink
what are you mad that you do reason so
not mad but mated how i do not know
it is a fault that springeth from your eye
for gazing on your beams fair sun being by
gaze where you should and that will clear your sight
as good to wink sweet love as look on night
no it is thyself mine own self’s better part mine eye’s clear eye my dear heart’s dearer heart my food my fortune and my sweet hope’s aim my sole earth’s heaven and my heaven’s claim
all this my sister is or else should be
call thyself sister sweet for i aim thee thee will i love and with thee lead my life thou hast no husband yet nor i no wife
o soft sir hold you still i’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill
exit luciana enter dromio of syracuse
thou art dromio thou art my man thou art thyself
i am an ass i am a woman’s man and besides myself
marry sir besides myself i am due to a woman one that claims me one that haunts me one that will have me
what claim lays she to thee
marry sir such claim as you would lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not that i being a beast she would have me but that she being a very beastly creature lays claim to me
a very reverent body ay such a one as a man may not speak of without he say “sir reverence”
i have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage
how dost thou mean a “fat marriage”
marry sir she’s the kitchen wench and all grease and i know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light
i warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn a poland winter
if she lives till doomsday she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world
swart like my shoe but her face nothing like so clean kept
she sweats a man may go overshoes in the grime of it
that’s a fault that water will mend
no sir ’tis in grain noah’s flood could not do it
nell sir but her name and three quarters that’s an ell and three quarters will not measure her from hip to hip
no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip
she is spherical like a globe
i could find out countries in her
in what part of her body stands ireland
marry sir in her buttocks i found it out by the bogs
i found it by the barrenness hard in the palm of the hand
in her forehead armed and reverted making war against her hair
i looked for the chalky cliffs but i could find no whiteness in them
but i guess it stood in her chin by the salt rheum that ran between france and it
faith i saw it not but i felt it hot in her breath
o sir upon her nose all o’er embellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of spain who sent whole armadoes of carracks to be ballast at her nose
o sir i did not look so low
to conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me called me dromio swore i was assured to her told me what privy marks i had about me as the mark of my shoulder the mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that i amazed ran from her as a witch
and i think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel she had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i’ the wheel
go hie thee presently post to the road and if the wind blow any way from shore i will not harbour in this town tonight
if any bark put forth come to the mart where i will walk till thou return to me
if everyone knows us and we know none ’tis time i think to trudge pack and be gone
as from a bear a man would run for life so fly i from her that would be my wife
there’s none but witches do inhabit here and therefore ’tis high time that i were hence
she that doth call me husband even my soul doth for a wife abhor
but her fair sister possess’d with such a gentle sovereign grace of such enchanting presence and discourse hath almost made me traitor to myself
but lest myself be guilty to self wrong i’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song
lo here is the chain i thought to have ta’en you at the porpentine the chain unfinish’d made me stay thus long
what is your will that i shall do with this
what please yourself sir i have made it for you
not once nor twice but twenty times you have
go home with it and please your wife withal and soon at supper time i’ll visit you and then receive my money for the chain
i pray you sir receive the money now for fear you ne’er see chain nor money more
you are a merry man sir fare you well
what i should think of this i cannot tell but this i think there’s no man is so vain that would refuse so fair an offer’d chain
i see a man here needs not live by shifts when in the streets he meets such golden gifts
i’ll to the mart and there for dromio stay if any ship put out then straight away
enter merchant angelo and an officer
you know since pentecost the sum is due and since i have not much importun’d you nor now i had not but that i am bound to persia and want guilders for my voyage therefore make present satisfaction or i’ll attach you by this officer
even just the sum that i do owe to you is growing to me by antipholus and in the instant that i met with you he had of me a chain at five o’clock i shall receive the money for the same
pleaseth you walk with me down to his house i will discharge my bond and thank you too
enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus from the courtesan’s
while i go to the goldsmith’s house go thou and buy a rope’s end that will i bestow among my wife and her confederates for locking me out of my doors by day
but soft i see the goldsmith get thee gone buy thou a rope and bring it home to me
i buy a thousand pound a year
a man is well holp up that trusts to you i promised your presence and the chain but neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
belike you thought our love would last too long if it were chain’d together and therefore came not
saving your merry humour here’s the note how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat the fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion which doth amount to three odd ducats more than i stand debted to this gentleman
i pray you see him presently discharg’d for he is bound to sea and stays but for it
i am not furnished with the present money besides i have some business in the town
good signior take the stranger to my house and with you take the chain and bid my wife disburse the sum on the receipt thereof perchance i will be there as soon as you
then you will bring the chain to her yourself
no bear it with you lest i come not time enough
have you the chain about you
and if i have not sir i hope you have or else you may return without your money
nay come i pray you sir give me the chain both wind and tide stays for this gentleman and i to blame have held him here too long
good lord you use this dalliance to excuse your breach of promise to the porpentine
i should have chid you for not bringing it but like a shrew you first begin to brawl
the hour steals on i pray you sir dispatch

enter dromio of syracuse from the bay

our fraughtage sir i have convey’d aboard and i have bought the oil the balsamum and aqua vitae
the ship is in her trim the merry wind blows fair from land they stay for nought at all but for their owner master and yourself
why thou peevish sheep what ship of epidamnum stays for me
a ship you sent me to to hire waftage
thou drunken slave i sent thee for a rope and told thee to what purpose and what end
you sent me for a rope’s end as soon
you sent me to the bay sir for a bark
i will debate this matter at more leisure and teach your ears to list me with more heed
to adriana villain hie thee straight give her this key and tell her in the desk that’s cover’d o’er with turkish tapestry there is a purse of ducats let her send it
tell her i am arrested in the street and that shall bail me
on officer to prison till it come
exeunt merchant angelo officer and antipholus of ephesus dromio of syracuse
to adriana that is where we din’d where dowsabel did claim me for her husband
she is too big i hope for me to compass
thither i must although against my will for servants must their masters’ minds fulfil
ah luciana did he tempt thee so
might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye that he did plead in earnest yea or no
look’d he or red or pale or sad or merrily
what observation mad’st thou in this case of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face
first he denied you had in him no right
he meant he did me none the more my spite
then swore he that he was a stranger here
and true he swore though yet forsworn he were
that love i begg’d for you he begg’d of me
with what persuasion did he tempt thy love
with words that in an honest suit might move
first he did praise my beauty then my speech
i cannot nor i will not hold me still
my tongue though not my heart shall have his will
he is deformed crooked old and sere ill fac’d worse bodied shapeless everywhere vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind stigmatical in making worse in mind
who would be jealous then of such a one
no evil lost is wail’d when it is gone
ah but i think him better than i say and yet would herein others’ eyes were worse far from her nest the lapwing cries away my heart prays for him though my tongue do curse
here go the desk the purse sweet now make haste
how hast thou lost thy breath
no he’s in tartar limbo worse than hell
a devil in an everlasting garment hath him one whose hard heart is button’d up with steel a fiend a fairy pitiless and rough a wolf nay worse a fellow all in buff a back friend a shoulder clapper one that countermands the passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well one that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell
why man what is the matter
i do not know the matter
he is ’rested on the case
i know not at whose suit he is arrested well but he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him that can i tell
will you send him mistress redemption the money in his desk
this i wonder at exit luciana thus he unknown to me should be in debt
tell me was he arrested on a band
not on a band but on a stronger thing a chain a chain
do you not hear it ring
no no the bell ’tis time that i were gone
it was two ere i left him and now the clock strikes one
o yes if any hour meet a sergeant ’a turns back for very fear
as if time were in debt
time is a very bankrupt and owes more than he’s worth to season
have you not heard men say that time comes stealing on by night and day
if he be in debt and theft and a sergeant in the way hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day
go dromio there’s the money bear it straight and bring thy master home immediately
come sister i am press’d down with conceit conceit my comfort and my injury
there’s not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their well acquainted friend and everyone doth call me by my name
some tender money to me some invite me some other give me thanks for kindnesses some offer me commodities to buy
even now a tailor call’d me in his shop and show’d me silks that he had bought for me and therewithal took measure of my body
sure these are but imaginary wiles and lapland sorcerers inhabit here
master here’s the gold you sent me for
what have you got the picture of old adam new apparelled
not that adam that kept the paradise but that adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the prodigal he that came behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you forsake your liberty
why ’tis a plain case he that went like a bass viol in a case of leather the man sir that when gentlemen are tired gives them a sob and ’rests them he sir that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris pike
ay sir the sergeant of the band he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band one that thinks a man always going to bed and says “god give you good rest ” antipholus of syracuse
well sir there rest in your foolery
is there any ship puts forth tonight
why sir i brought you word an hour since that the bark expedition put forth tonight and then were you hindered by the sergeant to tarry for the hoy delay
here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you
the fellow is distract and so am i and here we wander in illusions
some blessed power deliver us from hence
well met well met master antipholus
i see sir you have found the goldsmith now
is that the chain you promis’d me today
i charge thee tempt me not
nay she is worse she is the devil’s dam and here she comes in the habit of a light wench and thereof comes that the wenches say “god damn me” that’s as much to say “god make me a light wench ” it is written they appear to men like angels of light
light is an effect of fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn
your man and you are marvellous merry sir
master if you do expect spoon meat or bespeak a long spoon
marry he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil
what tell’st thou me of supping
thou art as you are all a sorceress
i conjure thee to leave me and be gone
give me the ring of mine you had at dinner or for my diamond the chain you promis’d and i’ll be gone sir and not trouble you
some devils ask but the paring of one’s nail a rush a hair a drop of blood a pin a nut a cherry stone but she more covetous would have a chain
master be wise and if you give it her the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it
i pray you sir my ring or else the chain i hope you do not mean to cheat me so
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse courtesan
now out of doubt antipholus is mad else would he never so demean himself
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats and for the same he promis’d me a chain both one and other he denies me now
the reason that i gather he is mad besides this present instance of his rage is a mad tale he told today at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance
belike his wife acquainted with his fits on purpose shut the doors against his way
my way is now to hie home to his house and tell his wife that being lunatic he rush’d into my house and took perforce my ring away
this course i fittest choose for forty ducats is too much to lose
enter antipholus of ephesus with an officer
fear me not man i will not break away i’ll give thee ere i leave thee so much money to warrant thee as i am ’rested for
my wife is in a wayward mood today and will not lightly trust the messenger that i should be attach’d in ephesus i tell you ’twill sound harshly in her ears
enter dromio of ephesus with a rope’s end
i think he brings the money
have you that i sent you for
here’s that i warrant you will pay them all
why sir i gave the money for the rope
five hundred ducats villain for a rope
i’ll serve you sir five hundred at the rate
to what end did i bid thee hie thee home
to a rope’s end sir and to that end am i return’d
and to that end sir i will welcome you
nay ’tis for me to be patient
nay rather persuade him to hold his hands
i would i were senseless sir that i might not feel your blows
thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an ass
i am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long ears
i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows
when i am cold he heats me with beating when i am warm he cools me with beating
i am waked with it when i sleep raised with it when i sit driven out of doors with it when i go from home welcomed home with it when i return
nay i bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat and i think when he hath lamed me i shall beg with it from door to door
enter adriana luciana courtesan and a schoolmaster called pinch
come go along my wife is coming yonder
mistress respice finem respect your end or rather the prophesy like the parrot “beware the rope’s end ” antipholus of ephesus
good doctor pinch you are a conjurer establish him in his true sense again and i will please you what you will demand
alas how fiery and how sharp he looks
mark how he trembles in his ecstasy
give me your hand and let me feel your pulse
there is my hand and let it feel your ear
i charge thee satan hous’d within this man to yield possession to my holy prayers and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight
i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven
peace doting wizard peace i am not mad
o that thou wert not poor distressed soul
you minion you are these your customers
did this companion with the saffron face revel and feast it at my house today whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house
o husband god doth know you din’d at home where would you had remain’d until this time free from these slanders and this open shame
sir sooth to say you did not dine at home
were not my doors lock’d up and i shut out
perdy your doors were lock’d and you shut out
and did not she herself revile me there
sans fable she herself revil’d you there
did not her kitchen maid rail taunt and scorn me
certes she did the kitchen vestal scorn’d you
and did not i in rage depart from thence
in verity you did my bones bear witness that since have felt the vigour of his rage
is’t good to soothe him in these contraries
it is no shame the fellow finds his vein and yielding to him humours well his frenzy
thou hast suborn’d the goldsmith to arrest me
i sent you money to redeem you by dromio here who came in haste for it
heart and goodwill you might but surely master not a rag of money
went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats
he came to me and i deliver’d it
and i am witness with her that she did
god and the rope maker bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope
mistress both man and master is possess’d i know it by their pale and deadly looks
they must be bound and laid in some dark room
say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today and why dost thou deny the bag of gold
i did not gentle husband lock thee forth
and gentle master i receiv’d no gold but i confess sir that we were lock’d out
dissembling villain thou speak’st false in both
dissembling harlot thou art false in all and art confederate with a damned pack to make a loathsome abject scorn of me
but with these nails i’ll pluck out these false eyes that would behold in me this shameful sport
enter three or four and offer to bind him
o bind him bind him let him not come near me
more company the fiend is strong within him
ay me poor man how pale and wan he looks
thou jailer thou i am thy prisoner
wilt thou suffer them to make a rescue
he is my prisoner and you shall not have him
go bind this man for he is frantic too
what wilt thou do thou peevish officer
hast thou delight to see a wretched man do outrage and displeasure to himself
if i let him go the debt he owes will be requir’d of me
i will discharge thee ere i go from thee bear me forthwith unto his creditor and knowing how the debt grows i will pay it
good master doctor see him safe convey’d home to my house
master i am here enter’d in bond for you
will you be bound for nothing
be mad good master cry “the devil”
god help poor souls how idly do they talk
exeunt pinch and assistants with antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus say now whose suit is he arrested at
one angelo a goldsmith do you know him
what is the sum he owes
due for a chain your husband had of him
he did bespeak a chain for me but had it not
when as your husband all in rage today came to my house and took away my ring the ring i saw upon his finger now straight after did i meet him with a chain
it may be so but i did never see it
come jailer bring me where the goldsmith is i long to know the truth hereof at large
enter antipholus of syracuse with his rapier drawn and dromio of syracuse
god for thy mercy they are loose again
let’s call more help to have them bound again
exeunt as fast as may be frighted antipholus of syracuse
i see these witches are afraid of swords
she that would be your wife now ran from you
come to the centaur fetch our stuff from thence
i long that we were safe and sound aboard
faith stay here this night they will surely do us no harm you saw they speak us fair give us gold
methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me i could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch
i will not stay tonight for all the town therefore away to get our stuff aboard
i am sorry sir that i have hinder’d you but i protest he had the chain of me though most dishonestly he doth deny it
how is the man esteem’d here in the city
of very reverend reputation sir of credit infinite highly belov’d second to none that lives here in the city
his word might bear my wealth at any time
yonder as i think he walks
enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
’tis so and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have
good sir draw near to me i’ll speak to him
signior antipholus i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble and not without some scandal to yourself with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly
beside the charge the shame imprisonment you have done wrong to this my honest friend who but for staying on our controversy had hoisted sail and put to sea today
this chain you had of me can you deny it
i think i had i never did deny it
yes that you did sir and forswore it too
who heard me to deny it or forswear it
these ears of mine thou know’st did hear thee
’tis pity that thou liv’st to walk where any honest men resort
thou art a villain to impeach me thus i’ll prove mine honour and mine honesty against thee presently if thou dar’st stand
i dare and do defy thee for a villain
they draw enter adriana luciana courtesan and others
hold hurt him not for god’s sake he is mad
some get within him take his sword away
bind dromio too and bear them to my house
run master run for god’s sake take a house
this is some priory in or we are spoil’d
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory enter lady abbess
to fetch my poor distracted husband hence
let us come in that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery
i knew he was not in his perfect wits
i am sorry now that i did draw on him
how long hath this possession held the man
this week he hath been heavy sour sad and much different from the man he was
but till this afternoon his passion ne’er brake into extremity of rage
hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
hath not else his eye stray’d his affection in unlawful love
a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
which of these sorrows is he subject to
to none of these except it be the last namely some love that drew him oft from home
you should for that have reprehended him
as roughly as my modesty would let me
it was the copy of our conference
in bed he slept not for my urging it at board he fed not for my urging it alone it was the subject of my theme in company i often glanced it still did i tell him it was vile and bad
and thereof came it that the man was mad
the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth
it seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing and thereof comes it that his head is light
thou say’st his meat was sauc’d with thy upbraidings
unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and what’s a fever but a fit of madness
thou say’st his sports were hinder’d by thy brawls
sweet recreation barr’d what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life
in food in sport and life preserving rest to be disturb’d would mad or man or beast
the consequence is then thy jealous fits hath scar’d thy husband from the use of’s wits
she never reprehended him but mildly when he demean’d himself rough rude and wildly
why bear you these rebukes and answer not
she did betray me to my own reproof
good people enter and lay hold on him
no not a creature enters in my house
then let your servants bring my husband forth
he took this place for sanctuary and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again or lose my labour in assaying it
i will attend my husband be his nurse diet his sickness for it is my office and will have no attorney but myself and therefore let me have him home with me
be patient for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers to make of him a formal man again
it is a branch and parcel of mine oath a charitable duty of my order therefore depart and leave him here with me
i will not hence and leave my husband here and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife
complain unto the duke of this indignity
i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess
by this i think the dial points at five
anon i’m sure the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale the place of death and sorry execution behind the ditches of the abbey here
to see a reverend syracusian merchant who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town beheaded publicly for his offence
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
enter the duke attended egeon bareheaded with the headsman and other officers
yet once again proclaim it publicly if any friend will pay the sum for him he shall not die so much we tender him
justice most sacred duke against the abbess
she is a virtuous and a reverend lady it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
may it please your grace antipholus my husband who i made lord of me and all i had at your important letters this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him that desp’rately he hurried through the street with him his bondman all as mad as he doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses bearing thence rings jewels anything his rage did like
once did i get him bound and sent him home whilst to take order for the wrongs i went that here and there his fury had committed
anon i wot not by what strong escape he broke from those that had the guard of him and with his mad attendant and himself each one with ireful passion with drawn swords met us again and madly bent on us chased us away till raising of more aid we came again to bind them
then they fled into this abbey whither we pursued them
and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
therefore most gracious duke with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
long since thy husband serv’d me in my wars and i to thee engag’d a prince’s word when thou didst make him master of thy bed to do him all the grace and good i could
go some of you knock at the abbey gate and bid the lady abbess come to me
i will determine this before i stir
o mistress mistress shift and save yourself
my master and his man are both broke loose beaten the maids a row and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire and ever as it blazed they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool and sure unless you send some present help between them they will kill the conjurer
peace fool thy master and his man are here and that is false thou dost report to us
mistress upon my life i tell you true
i have not breath’d almost since i did see it
he cries for you and vows if he can take you to scorch your face and to disfigure you
cry within hark hark i hear him mistress
come stand by me fear nothing
ay me it is my husband
witness you that he is borne about invisible
even now we hous’d him in the abbey here and now he’s there past thought of human reason
enter antipholus and dromio of ephesus
justice most gracious duke o grant me justice
even for the service that long since i did thee when i bestrid thee in the wars and took deep scars to save thy life even for the blood that then i lost for thee now grant me justice
unless the fear of death doth make me dote i see my son antipholus and dromio
justice sweet prince against that woman there
she whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife that hath abused and dishonour’d me even in the strength and height of injury
beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me
discover how and thou shalt find me just
this day great duke she shut the doors upon me while she with harlots feasted in my house
myself he and my sister today did dine together
so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal
ne’er may i look on day nor sleep on night but she tells to your highness simple truth
in this the madman justly chargeth them
my liege i am advised what i say neither disturb’d with the effect of wine nor heady rash provok’d with raging ire albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
this woman lock’d me out this day from dinner
that goldsmith there were he not pack’d with her could witness it for he was with me then who parted with me to go fetch a chain promising to bring it to the porpentine where balthasar and i did dine together
our dinner done and he not coming thither i went to seek him
in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman
there did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him receiv’d the chain which god he knows i saw not
for the which he did arrest me with an officer
i did obey and sent my peasant home for certain ducats
then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house
by th’ way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more of vile confederates
along with them they brought one pinch a hungry lean faced villain a mere anatomy a mountebank a threadbare juggler and a fortune teller a needy hollow ey’d sharp looking wretch a living dead man
this pernicious slave forsooth took on him as a conjurer and gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse and with no face as ’twere outfacing me cries out i was possess’d
then altogether they fell upon me bound me bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man both bound together till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder i gain’d my freedom and immediately ran hither to your grace whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities
my lord in truth thus far i witness with him that he din’d not at home but was lock’d out
but had he such a chain of thee or no
he had my lord and when he ran in here these people saw the chain about his neck
besides i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you and then you fled into this abbey here from whence i think you are come by miracle
i never came within these abbey walls nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
i never saw the chain so help me heaven and this is false you burden me withal
why what an intricate impeach is this
i think you all have drunk of circe’s cup
if here you hous’d him here he would have been
if he were mad he would not plead so coldly
you say he din’d at home the goldsmith here denies that saying
sir he dined with her there at the porpentine
he did and from my finger snatch’d that ring
’tis true my liege this ring i had of her
saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here
as sure my liege as i do see your grace
i think you are all mated or stark mad
exit one to the abbess egeon
most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me
speak freely syracusian what thou wilt
is not your name sir call’d antipholus
and is not that your bondman dromio
within this hour i was his bondman sir but he i thank him gnaw’d in two my cords
now am i dromio and his man unbound
i am sure you both of you remember me
ourselves we do remember sir by you
for lately we were bound as you are now
you are not pinch’s patient are you sir
why look you strange on me
i never saw you in my life till now
grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last and careful hours with time’s deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face
but tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
no trust me sir nor i egeon
ay sir but i am sure i do not and whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him
o time’s extremity hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untun’d cares
though now this grained face of mine be hid in sap consuming winter’s drizzled snow and all the conduits of my blood froze up yet hath my night of life some memory my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left my dull deaf ears a little use to hear
all these old witnesses i cannot err tell me thou art my son antipholus
i never saw my father in my life
but seven years since in syracusa boy thou know’st we parted but perhaps my son thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery
the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so
i ne’er saw syracusa in my life
i tell thee syracusian twenty years have i been patron to antipholus during which time he ne’er saw syracusa
i see thy age and dangers make thee dote
enter the abbess with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse
most mighty duke behold a man much wrong’d
all gather to see them adriana
i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
one of these men is genius to the other and so of these which is the natural man and which the spirit
i sir am dromio command him away
i sir am dromio pray let me stay
o my old master who hath bound him here
whoever bound him i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty
speak old egeon if thou be’st the man that hadst a wife once called emilia that bore thee at a burden two fair sons
o if thou be’st the same egeon speak and speak unto the same emilia
why here begins his morning story right these two antipholus’ these two so like and these two dromios one in semblance besides her urging of her wreck at sea
these are the parents to these children which accidentally are met together
if i dream not thou art emilia
if thou art she tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft
by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio all were taken up but by and by rude fishermen of corinth by force took dromio and my son from them and me they left with those of epidamnum
what then became of them i cannot tell i to this fortune that you see me in
antipholus thou cam’st from corinth first
no sir not i i came from syracuse
stay stand apart i know not which is which
i came from corinth my most gracious lord
brought to this town by that most famous warrior duke menaphon your most renowned uncle
which of you two did dine with me today
and are not you my husband
no i say nay to that
and so do i yet did she call me so and this fair gentlewoman her sister here did call me brother
what i told you then i hope i shall have leisure to make good if this be not a dream i see and hear
that is the chain sir which you had of me
and you sir for this chain arrested me
i sent you money sir to be your bail by dromio but i think he brought it not
this purse of ducats i receiv’d from you and dromio my man did bring them me
i see we still did meet each other’s man and i was ta’en for him and he for me and thereupon these errors are arose
these ducats pawn i for my father here
it shall not need thy father hath his life
sir i must have that diamond from you
there take it and much thanks for my good cheer
renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes and all that are assembled in this place that by this sympathised one day’s error have suffer’d wrong go keep us company and we shall make full satisfaction
thirty three years have i but gone in travail of you my sons and till this present hour my heavy burden ne’er delivered
the duke my husband and my children both and you the calendars of their nativity go to a gossips’ feast and go with me
after so long grief such nativity
with all my heart i’ll gossip at this feast
exeunt except the two dromios and two brothers dromio of syracuse
master shall i fetch your stuff from shipboard
dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embark’d
your goods that lay at host sir in the centaur
he speaks to me i am your master dromio
embrace thy brother there rejoice with him
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and antipholus of ephesus dromio of syracuse
there is a fat friend at your master’s house that kitchen’d me for you today at dinner
she now shall be my sister not my wife
methinks you are my glass and not my brother
i see by you i am a sweet faced youth
will you walk in to see their gossiping
not i sir you are my elder
that’s a question how shall we try it
we’ll draw cuts for the senior
nay then thus we came into the world like brother and brother and now let’s go hand in hand not one before another
a street enter a company of mutinous citizens with staves clubs and other weapons first citizen
before we proceed any further hear me speak
you are all resolv d rather to die than to famish
first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people
we know t we know t
let us kill him and we ll have corn at our own price
no more talking on t let it be done
we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear
the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them
let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
would you proceed especially against caius marcius
against him first he s a very dog to the commonalty
consider you what services he has done for his country
very well and could be content to give him good report for t but that he pays himself with being proud
i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though soft conscienc d men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue
what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him
you must in no way say he is covetous
if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
shouts within what shouts are these
the other side o th city is risen
worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always lov d the people
he s one honest enough would all the rest were so
what work s my countrymen in hand
where go you with bats and clubs
our business is not unknown to th senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we ll show em in deeds
they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too
why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves
we cannot sir we are undone already
i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you
for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment
for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help
alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o th state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies
they ne er car d for us yet
suffer us to famish and their storehouses cramm d with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor
if the wars eat us not up they will and there s all the love they bear us
either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accus d of folly
i shall tell you a pretty tale
it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t a little more
well i ll hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale
but an t please you deliver
there was a time when all the body s members rebell d against the belly thus accus d it that only like a gulf it did remain i th midst o th body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where th other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body
the belly answer d first citizen
well sir what answer made the belly
with a kind of smile which ne er came from the lungs but even thus for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to th discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you
the kingly crowned head the vigilant eye the counsellor heart the arm our soldier our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter with other muniments and petty helps is this our fabric if that they menenius
should by the cormorant belly be restrain d who is the sink o th body menenius
the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer
i will tell you if you ll bestow a small of what you have little patience awhile you st hear the belly s answer
note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answered
true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body
but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to th seat o th brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live
and though that all at once you my good friends this says the belly mark me
though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran
the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o th common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves
what do you think you the great toe of this assembly
for that being one o th lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost
thou rascal that art worst in blood to run lead st first to win some vantage
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale
enter caius marcius hail noble marcius
what s the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs
we have ever your good word
he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring
what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war
the one affrights you the other makes you proud
he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun
your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it
who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick man s appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil
he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes
with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland
what s the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another
for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stor d
they ll sit by th fire and presume to know what s done i th capitol who s like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes
they say there s grain enough
would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword i d make a quarry with thousands of these quarter d slaves as high as i could pick my lance
nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly
but i beseech you what says the other troop
they said they were an hungry sigh d forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only
with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answer d and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o th moon shouting their emulation
five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice
one s junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know not
the rabble should have first unroof d the city ere so prevail d with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection s arguing
go get you home you fragments
the news is sir the volsces are in arms
i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity
enter cominius titus lartius with other senators junius brutus and sicinius velutus first senator
marcius tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms
they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to t
i sin in envying his nobility and were i anything but what i am i would wish me only he
were half to half the world by th ears and he upon my party i d revolt to make only my wars with him
he is a lion that i am proud to hunt
then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars
sir it is and i am constant
titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
no caius marcius i ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t other ere stay behind this business
your company to th capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us
to marcius follow cominius we must follow you right worthy you priority
to the citizens hence to your homes be gone
the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners
worshipful mutineers your valour puts well forth pray follow
exeunt all but sicinius and brutus sicinius
was ever man so proud as is this marcius
when we were chosen tribunes for the people brutus
mark d you his lip and eyes
being mov d he will not spare to gird the gods
he is grown too proud to be so valiant
such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon
but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius
fame at the which he aims in whom already he is well grac d cannot better be held nor more attain d than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the general s fault though he perform to th utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius o if he had borne the business
besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius
half all cominius honours are to marcius though marcius earn d them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not
let s hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action
enter tullus aufidius with senators of corioli first senator
so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are ent red in our counsels and know how we proceed
what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention
tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is reads they have press d a power but it is not known whether for east or west
the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumour d cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither tis bent
most likely tis for you consider of it
our army s in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us
nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil d till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seem d appear d to rome
by the discovery we shall be short ned in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot
noble aufidius take your commission hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli
if they set down before s for the remove bring up your army but i think you ll find th have not prepar d for us
nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward
if we and caius marcius chance to meet tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more
marcius house enter volumnia and virgilia mother and wife to marcius they set them down on two low stools and sew volumnia
i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort
if my son were my husband i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love
when yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness pluck d all gaze his way when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picture like to hang by th wall if renown made it not stir was pleas d to let him seek danger where he was to find fame
to a cruel war i sent him from whence he return d his brows bound with oak
i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man
but had he died in the business madam how then
then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue
hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
madam the lady valeria is come to visit you
beseech you give me leave to retire myself
methinks i hear hither your husband s drum see him pluck aufidius down by th hair as children from a bear the volsces shunning him
methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus come on you cowards
you were got in fear though you were born in rome
his bloody brow with his mail d hand then wiping forth he goes like to a harvest man that s task d to mow or all or lose his hire
it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy
the breasts of hecuba when she did suckle hector look d not lovelier than hector s forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword contemning
tell valeria we are fit to bid her welcome
heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius
he ll beat aufidius head below his knee and tread upon his neck
re enter gentlewoman with valeria and an usher valeria
my ladies both good day to you
i am glad to see your ladyship
a fine spot in good faith
i thank your ladyship well good madam
he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster
o my word the father s son
i ll swear tis a very pretty boy
o my troth i look d upon him a wednesday half an hour together has such a confirm d countenance
i saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and up again catch d it again or whether his fall enrag d him or how twas he did so set his teeth and tear it
o i warrant how he mammock d it
one on s father s moods
indeed la tis a noble child
come lay aside your stitchery i must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon
no good madam i will not out of doors
indeed no by your patience i ll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars
fie you confine yourself most unreasonably come you must go visit the good lady that lies in
i will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers but i cannot go thither
tis not to save labour nor that i want love
you would be another penelope yet they say all the yarn she spun in ulysses absence did but fill ithaca full of moths
come i would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you might leave pricking it for pity
come you shall go with us
no good madam pardon me indeed i will not forth
in truth la go with me and i ll tell you excellent news of your husband
o good madam there can be none yet
verily i do not jest with you there came news from him last night
in earnest it s true i heard a senator speak it
thus it is the volsces have an army forth against whom cominius the general is gone with one part of our roman power
your lord and titus lartius are set down before their city corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars
this is true on mine honour and so i pray go with us
give me excuse good madam i will obey you in everything hereafter
let her alone lady as she is now she will but disease our better mirth
in troth i think she would
prithee virgilia turn thy solemness out o door and go along with us
no at a word madam indeed i must not
before corioli enter marcius titus lartius with drum and colours with captains and soldiers
yonder comes news a wager they have met
say has our general met the enemy
they lie in view but have not spoke as yet
so the good horse is mine
i ll buy him of you
no i ll nor sell nor give him lend you him i will for half a hundred years
how far off lie these armies
then shall we hear their larum and they ours
now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends
enter two senators with others on the walls of corioli tullus aufidius is he within your walls
no nor a man that fears you less than he that s lesser than a little
drum afar off hark our drums are bringing forth our youth
we ll break our walls rather than they shall pound us up our gates which yet seem shut we have but pinn d with rushes they ll open of themselves
alarum far off hark you far off
list what work he makes amongst your cloven army
enter the army of the volsces marcius
they fear us not but issue forth their city
now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath
he that retires i ll take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge
the romans are beat back to their trenches
all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome
you herd of boils and plagues plaster you o er that you may be abhorr d farther than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile
you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat
backs red and faces pale with flight and agued fear
mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven i ll leave the foe and make my wars on you
come on if you ll stand fast we ll beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches
the volsces fly and marcius follows them to the gates so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds tis for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers
mark me and do the like
marcius enters the gates first soldier
marcius is shut in first soldier
see they have shut him in
to th pot i warrant him
alarum continues re enter titus lartius lartius
following the fliers at the very heels with them he enters who upon the sudden clapp d to their gates
he is himself alone to answer all the city
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword and when it bows stand st up
thou art left marcius a carbuncle entire as big as thou art were not so rich a jewel
thou wast a soldier even to cato s wish not fierce and terrible only in strokes but with thy grim looks and the thunder like percussion of thy sounds thou mad st thine enemies shake as if the world were feverous and did tremble
re enter marcius bleeding assaulted by the enemy first soldier
let s fetch him off or make remain alike
they fight and all enter the city scene v within corioli
a street enter certain romans with spoils first roman
this will i carry to rome
alarum continues still afar off enter marcius and titus lartius with a trumpeter marcius
see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crack d drachma
cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up
exeunt pillagers and hark what noise the general makes
there is the man of my soul s hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius
worthy sir thou bleed st thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight
sir praise me not my work hath yet not warm d me
fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me
to aufidius thus i will appear and fight
now the fair goddess fortune fall deep in love with thee and her great charms misguide thy opposers swords
bold gentleman prosperity be thy page
thy friend no less than those she placeth highest
exit marcius go sound thy trumpet in the market place call thither all the officers o th town where they shall know our mind
near the camp of cominius enter cominius as it were in retire with soldiers cominius
well fought we are come off like romans neither foolish in our stands nor cowardly in retire
believe me sirs we shall be charg d again
whiles we have struck by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends
the roman gods lead their successes as we wish our own that both our powers with smiling fronts encount ring may give you thankful sacrifice
the citizens of corioli have issued and given to lartius and to marcius battle i saw our party to their trenches driven and then i came away
though thou speak st truth methinks thou speak st not well
tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour and bring thy news so late
spies of the volsces held me in chase that i was forc d to wheel three or four miles about else had i sir half an hour since brought my report
who s yonder that does appear as he were flay d
he has the stamp of marcius and i have before time seen him thus
the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor more than i know the sound of marcius tongue from every meaner man
ay if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own
let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i woo d in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burn d to bedward
flower of warriors how is t with titus lartius
as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threat ning th other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will
where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches
let him alone he did inform the truth
but for our gentlemen the common file a plague
the mouse ne er shunn d the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they
will the time serve to tell
are you lords o th field
if not why cease you till you are so
marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose
know you on which side they have plac d their men of trust
as i guess marcius their bands i th vaward are the antiates of their best trust o er them aufidius their very heart of hope
i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by th blood we have shed together by th vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanc d and darts we prove this very hour
though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action
those are they that most are willing
if any such be here as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smear d if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country s dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow marcius
they all shout and wave their swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps o me alone
make you a sword of me
if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces
none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his
a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obey d
please you to march and four shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclin d
march on my fellows make good this ostentation and you shall divide in all with us
the gates of corioli titus lartius having set a guard upon corioli going with drum and trumpet toward cominius and caius marcius enters with a lieutenant other soldiers and a scout lartius
so let the ports be guarded keep your duties as i have set them down
if i do send dispatch those centuries to our aid the rest will serve for a short holding
if we lose the field we cannot keep the town
hence and shut your gates upon s
our guider come to th roman camp conduct us
a field of battle between the roman and the volscian camps alarum as in battle
enter marcius and aufidius at several doors marcius
i ll fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promise breaker
we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy
let the first budger die the other s slave and the gods doom him after
if i fly marcius halloa me like a hare
within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioli walls and made what work i pleas d
tis not my blood wherein thou seest me mask d
for thy revenge wrench up thy power to th highest
wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragg d progeny thou shouldst not scape me here
here they fight and certain volsces come in the aid of aufidius
marcius fights till they be driven in breathless officious and not valiant you have sham d me in your condemned seconds
enter at one door cominius with the romans at another door marcius with his arm in a scarf cominius
if i should tell thee o er this thy day s work thou t not believe thy deeds but i ll report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles where great patricians shall attend and shrug i th end admire where ladies shall be frighted and gladly quak d hear more where the dull tribunes that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours shall say against their hearts we thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier
yet cam st thou to a morsel of this feast having fully din d before
enter titus lartius with his power from the pursuit lartius
o general here is the steed we the caparison
pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me
i have done as you have done that s what i can induc d as you have been that s for my country
he that has but effected his good will hath overta en mine act
you shall not be the grave of your deserving rome must know the value of her own
twere a concealment worse than a theft no less than a traducement to hide your doings and to silence that which to the spire and top of praises vouch d would seem but modest
therefore i beseech you in sign of what you are not to reward what you have done before our army hear me
i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves rememb red
should they not well might they fester gainst ingratitude and tent themselves with death
of all the horses whereof we have ta en good and good store of all the treasure in this field achiev d and city we render you the tenth to be ta en forth before the common distribution at your only choice
i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword
i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing
cast up their caps and lances
cominius and lartius stand bare may these same instruments which you profane never sound more
when drums and trumpets shall i th field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of false fac d soothing
when steel grows soft as the parasite s silk let him be made an overture for th wars
for that i have not wash d my nose that bled or foil d some debile wretch which without note here s many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i lov d my little should be dieted in praises sauc d with lies
too modest are you more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly
by your patience if gainst yourself you be incens d we ll put you like one that means his proper harm in manacles then reason safely with you
therefore be it known as to us to all the world that caius marcius wears this war s garland in token of the which my noble steed known to the camp i give him with all his trim belonging and from this time for what he did before corioli can him with all th applause and clamour of the host caius marcius coriolanus
i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no
howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to th fairness of my power
so to our tent where ere we do repose us we will write to rome of our success
you titus lartius must to corioli back
send us to rome the best with whom we may articulate for their own good and ours
the gods begin to mock me
i that now refus d most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general
take t tis yours what is t
i sometime lay here in corioli at a poor man s house he us d me kindly
he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath o erwhelm d my pity
i request you to give my poor host freedom
were he the butcher of my son he should be free as is the wind
i am weary yea my memory is tir d
the blood upon your visage dries tis time it should be look d to
the camp of the volsces a flourish
enter tullus aufidius bloody with two or three soldiers aufidius
twill be deliver d back on good condition
i would i were a roman for i cannot being a volsce be that i am
what good condition can a treaty find i th part that is at mercy
five times marcius i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so i think should we encounter as often as we eat
by th elements if e er again i meet him beard to beard he s mine or i am his
mine emulation hath not that honour in t it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword i ll potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him
my valour s poison d with only suff ring stain by him for him shall fly out of itself
nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice embarquements all of fury shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom gainst my hate to marcius
where i find him were it at home upon my brother s guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand in s heart
go you to th city learn how tis held and what they are that must be hostages for rome
i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you tis south the city mills bring me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey
a public place enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people sicinius and brutus menenius
the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius
nature teaches beasts to know their friends
pray you who does the wolf love
ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius
he s a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
he s a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb
you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you
in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance
he s poor in no one fault but stor d with all
and topping all others in boasting
do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o th right hand file
why how are we censur d
because you talk of pride now will you not be angry
why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience
give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so
you blame marcius for being proud
we do it not alone sir
i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant like for doing much alone
o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves
why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome
menenius you are known well enough too
i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in t said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning
what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath
meeting two such wealsmen as you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it
i cannot say your worships have deliver d the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces
if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too
what harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too
come sir come we know you well enough
you know neither me yourselves nor any thing
you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience
when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinch d with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing
all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves
you are a pair of strange ones
come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol
our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are
when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher s cushion or to be entomb d in an ass s pack saddle
yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen
more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians
i will be bold to take my leave of you
brutus and sicinius go aside enter volumnia virgilia and valeria how now my as fair as noble ladies and the moon were she earthly no nobler whither do you follow your eyes so fast
honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for the love of juno let s go
ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation
take my cap jupiter and i thank thee
look here s a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and i think there s one at home for you
i will make my very house reel to night
yes certain there s a letter for you i saw t
it gives me an estate of seven years health in which time i will make a lip at the physician
the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse drench
he was wont to come home wounded
o he is wounded i thank the gods for t
so do i too if it be not too much
brings a victory in his pocket
on s brows menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland
has he disciplin d aufidius soundly
titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off
and twas time for him too i ll warrant him that an he had stay d by him i would not have been so fidius d for all the chests in corioli and the gold that s in them
is the senate possess d of this
yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly
in troth there s wondrous things spoke of him
ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing
i ll be sworn they are true
to the tribunes god save your good worships
marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud
i th shoulder and i th left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place
he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i th body
one i th neck and two i th thigh there s nine that i know
he had before this last expedition twenty five wounds upon him
now it s twenty seven every gash was an enemy s grave
these are the ushers of marcius
before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie which being advanc d declines and then men die
enter cominius the general and titus lartius between them coriolanus crown d with an oaken garland with captains and soldiers and a herald herald
know rome that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won with fame a name to caius marcius these in honour follows coriolanus
no more of this it does offend my heart
o you have i know petition d all the gods for my prosperity
nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by deed achieving honour newly nam d what is it
wouldst thou have laugh d had i come coffin d home that weep st to see me triumph
ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons
to valeria o my sweet lady pardon
i know not where to turn
i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy
a curse begin at very root on s heart that is not glad to see thee
you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crab trees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish
we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly
give way there and go on
to his wife and mother your hand and yours
ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have receiv d not only greetings but with them change of honours
i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there s one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee
know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs
exeunt in state as before brutus and sicinius come forward brutus
all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him
your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck clamb ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smother d up leads fill d and ridges hors d with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him
seld shown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station our veil d dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicely gawded cheeks to th wanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses
such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture
on the sudden i warrant him consul
then our office may during his power go sleep
he cannot temp rately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won
doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to do t
i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i th market place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to th people beg their stinking breaths
o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles
i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution
it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction
so it must fall out to him or our authorities
for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that to s power he would have made them mules silenc d their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in their war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them
this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want if he be put upon t and that s as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever
you are sent for to the capitol
tis thought that marcius shall be consul
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he pass d the nobles bended as to jove s statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
let s to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for th time but hearts for the event
the capitol enter two officers to lay cushions as it were in the capitol first officer
come come they are almost here
three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it
that s a brave fellow but he s vengeance proud and loves not the common people
faith there have been many great men that have flatter d the people who ne er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground
therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see t
if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite
now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love
he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every car that heard it
no more of him he s a worthy man
enter the patricians and the tribunes of the people lictors before them coriolanus menenius cominius the consul
sicinius and brutus take their places by themselves
having determin d of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our after meeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country
therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our well found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform d by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself
leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our state s defective for requital than we to stretch it out
masters o th people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here
we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly
which the rather we shall be bless d to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto priz d them at
that s off that s off i would you rather had been silent
please you to hear cominius speak
but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it
he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow
coriolanus rises and offers to go away nay keep your place
sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done
i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them
sir i hope my words disbench d you not
no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words
you sooth d not therefore hurt not
but your people i love them as they weigh menenius
i had rather have one scratch my head i th sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster d
masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter that s thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one on s ears to hear it
i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter d feebly
it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver
if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpois d
at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him he bestrid an o erpress d roman and i th consul s view slew three opposers tarquin s self he met and struck him on his knee
in that day s feats when he might act the woman in the scene he prov d best man i th field and for his meed was brow bound with the oak
his pupil age man ent red thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch d all swords of the garland
for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home
he stopp d the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obey d and fell below his stem
his sword death s stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was tim d with dying cries
alone he ent red the mortal gate of th city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden re enforcement struck corioli like a planet
when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit re quick ned what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking o er the lives of men as if twere a perpetual spoil and till we call d both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting
he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him
our spoils he kick d at and look d upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world
he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it
he s right noble let him be call d for
the senate coriolanus are well pleas d to make thee consul
i do owe them still my life and services
it then remains that you do speak to the people
i do beseech you let me o erleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage
please you that i may pass this doing
sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony
pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form
it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people
to brag unto them thus i did and thus
show them th unaching scars which i should hide as if i had receiv d them for the hire of their breath only
we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour
to coriolanus come all joy and honour
then exeunt all but sicinius and brutus brutus
you see how he intends to use the people
he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give
come we ll inform them of our proceedings here
on th market place i know they do attend us
the forum enter seven or eight citizens first citizen
once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him
we may sir if we will
we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them
ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members
and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many headed multitude
we have been call d so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely colour d and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o th compass
which way do you judge my wit would fly
nay your wit will not so soon out as another man s will tis strongly wedg d up in a block head but if it were at liberty twould sure southward
to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
you are never without your tricks you may you may
are you all resolv d to give your voices
but that s no matter the greater part carries it
i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man
enter coriolanus in a gown of humility with menenius here he comes and in the gown of humility
we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes
he s to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i ll direct you how you shall go by him
o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have done t
i pray sir plague upon t
i cannot bring my tongue to such a pace
look sir my wounds i got them in my country s service when some certain of your brethren roar d and ran from th noise of our own drums
you must not speak of that
you must desire them to think upon you
i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by em
pray you speak to em i pray you in wholesome manner
exit re enter three of the citizens coriolanus
bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean
you know the cause sir of my standing here
we do sir tell us what hath brought you to t
no sir twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging
you must think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you
well then i pray your price o th consulship
the price is to ask it kindly
kindly sir i pray let me ha t
i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private
your good voice sir what say you
you shall ha it worthy sir
there s in all two worthy voices begg d
an twere to give again but tis no matter
exeunt the three citizens re enter two other citizens coriolanus
pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown
you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly
you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends
you have not indeed loved the common people
you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love
i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly
that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers
therefore beseech you i may be consul
we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily
you have received many wounds for your country
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them
i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther
the gods give you joy sir heartily
better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve
why in this wolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches
what custom wills in all things should we do t the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heap d for truth to o erpeer
rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus
i am half through the one part suffered the other will i do
re enter three citizens more here come moe voices
for your voices i have fought watch d for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more
he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest man s voice
the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people
re enter menenius with brutus and sicinius menenius
you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the people s voice
remains that in th official marks invested you anon do meet the senate
the custom of request you have discharg d
the people do admit you and are summon d to meet anon upon your approbation
that i ll straight do and knowing myself again repair to th senate house
we stay here for the people
exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now and by his looks methinks tis warm at s heart
with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
to my poor unworthy notice he mock d us when he begg d our voices
no tis his kind of speech he did not mock us
not one amongst us save yourself but says he us d us scornfully
he should have show d us his marks of merit wounds receiv d for s country
why so he did i am sure
no no no man saw em
he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore
when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices
thank you your most sweet voices
now you have left your voices i have no further with you
why either were you ignorant to see t or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices
could you not have told him as you were lesson d when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i th body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o th state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to th plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves
you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord
thus to have said as you were fore advis d had touch d his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluck d either his gracious promise which you might as cause had call d you up have held him to or else it would have gall d his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught
so putting him to rage you should have ta en th advantage of his choler and pass d him unelected
did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush
why had your bodies no heart among you
or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment
have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your su d for tongues
he s not confirm d we may deny him yet
and will deny him i ll have five hundred voices of that sound
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em
get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so
let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election
enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scorn d you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you th apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you
lay a fault on us your tribunes that we labour d no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him
say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds pre occupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul
say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o th marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numa s daughter s son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our best water brought by conduits hither and censorinus nobly named so twice being by the people chosen censor was his great ancestor
one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that he s your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation
say you ne er had done t harp on that still but by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to th capitol
will will so almost all repent in their election
let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater
if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger
we will be there before the stream o th people and this shall seem as partly tis their own which we have goaded onward
enter coriolanus menenius all the gentry cominius titus lartius and other senators coriolanus
tullus aufidius then had made new head
he had my lord and that it was which caus d our swifter composition
so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon s again
they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again
on safeguard he came to me and did curse against the volsces for they had so vilely yielded the town
he is retir d to antium
how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution so he might be call d your vanquisher
i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully
enter sicinius and brutus behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o th common mouth
i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance
it will be dangerous to go on no further
hath he not pass d the noble and the common
have i had children s voices
tribunes give way he shall to th market place
the people are incens d against him
stop or all will fall in broil
must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues
you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
have you not set them on
it is a purpos d thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer t and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be rul d
the people cry you mock d them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repin d scandal d the suppliants for the people call d them time pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
have you inform d them sithence
you are like to do such business
not unlike each way to better yours
why then should i be consul
by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune
you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must enquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune
the people are abus d set on
this palt ring becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonour d rub laid falsely i th plain way of his merit
this was my speech and i will speak t again menenius
not in this heat sir now
now as i live i will
my nobler friends i crave their pardons
for the mutable rank scented meiny let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves
i say again in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plough d for sow d and scatter d by mingling them with us the honour d number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars
no more words we beseech you
as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them
you speak o th people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity
twere well we let the people know t
were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove twould be my mind
it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further
hear you this triton of the minnows
o good but most unwise patricians
why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o th monster s wants not spirit to say he ll turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his
if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity
if you are learn d be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you
you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the great st taste most palates theirs
they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frown d in greece
by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by th other
well on to th market place
whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o th storehouse gratis as twas us d sometime in greece menenius
well well no more of that
though there the people had more absolute pow r i say they nourish d disobedience fed the ruin of the state
why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice
i ll give my reasons more worthier than their voices
they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assur d they ne er did service for t being press d to th war even when the navel of the state was touch d they would not thread the gates
this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis
being i th war their mutinies and revolts wherein they show d most valour spoke not for them
th accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the native of our so frank donation
how shall this bosom multiplied digest the senate s courtesy
let deeds express what s like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands
thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o th senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles
what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal
this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance it must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness
purpose so barr d it follows nothing is done to purpose
therefore beseech you you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change on t that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that s sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison
your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become t not having the power to do the good it would for th ill which doth control t
has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do
thou wretch despite o erwhelm thee
what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench
in a rebellion when what s not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i th dust
enter an aedile let him be apprehended
go call the people exit aedile in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to th public weal
obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer
or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments
enter a rabble of plebeians with the aediles menenius
here s he that would take from you all your power
they all bustle about coriolanus all
peace peace peace stay hold peace
i am out of breath confusion s near i cannot speak
you tribunes to th people coriolanus patience
you are at point to lose your liberties
marcius would have all from you marcius whom late you have nam d for consul
this is the way to kindle not to quench
to unbuild the city and to lay all flat
what is the city but the people
true the people are the city
by the consent of all we were establish d the people s magistrates
and so are like to do
that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin
or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it
we do here pronounce upon the part o th people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death
therefore lay hold of him bear him to th rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him
hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word
be that you seem truly your country s friend and temp rately proceed to what you would thus violently redress
sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent
lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock
there s some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
help marcius help you that be noble help him young and old
down with him down with him
in this mutiny the tribunes the aediles and the people are beat in menenius
go get you to your house be gone away
stand fast we have as many friends as enemies
shall it be put to that
i prithee noble friend home to thy house leave us to cure this cause
for tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
i would they were barbarians as they are though in rome litter d not romans as they are not though calved i th porch o th capitol
put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another
on fair ground i could beat forty of them
i could myself take up a brace o th best of them yea the two tribunes
but now tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is call d foolery when it stands against a falling fabric
will you hence before the tag return
whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and o erbear what they are us d to bear
i ll try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patch d with cloth of any colour
exeunt coriolanus and cominius with others patricians
this man has marr d his fortune
his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for s power to thunder
his heart s his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death
a noise within here s goodly work
i would they were a bed
i would they were in tiber
what the vengeance could he not speak em fair
re enter brutus and sicinius the rabble again sicinius
where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself
he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought
he shall well know the noble tribunes are the people s mouths and we their hands
do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant
sir how comes t that you have holp to make this rescue
as i do know the consul s worthiness so can i name his faults
if by the tribunes leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time
speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies to night
now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enroll d in jove s own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own
he s a disease that must be cut away
o he s a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to rome that s worthy death
killing our enemies the blood he hath lost which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ounce he dropt it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that do t and suffer it a brand to th end o th world
when he did love his country it honour d him
the service of the foot being once gangren d is not then respected for what before it was
pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further
one word more one word this tiger footed rage when it shall find the harm of unscann d swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds to s heels
proceed by process lest parties as he is belov d break out and sack great rome with romans
have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted
consider this he has been bred i th wars since a could draw a sword and is ill school d in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction
give me leave i ll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril
noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning
noble menenius be you then as the people s officer
we ll attend you there where if you bring not marcius we ll proceed in our first way
i ll bring him to you
to the senators let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow
pray you let s to him
the house of coriolanus enter coriolanus with nobles coriolanus
let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them
i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war
enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder
would you have me false to my nature
rather say i play the man i am
o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out
you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not show d them how ye were dispos d ere they lack d power to cross you
enter menenius with the senators menenius
come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it
there s no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish
pray be counsell d i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage
before he should thus stoop to th herd but that the violent fit o th time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear
i cannot do it to the gods must i then do t to them
you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak
i have heard you say honour and policy like unsever d friends i th war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by th other lose that they combine not there
if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request
because that now it lies you on to speak to th people not by your own instruction nor by th matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom s truth
now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood
i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake requir d i should do so in honour
i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin
come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the los of what is past
i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretch d it here be with them thy knee bussing the stones for in such busines action is eloquence and the eyes of th ignorant more learned than the ears waving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling
or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person
this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being ask d as free as words to little purpose
prithee now go and be rul d although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower
i have been i th market place and sir tis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence all s in anger
i think twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit
prithee now say you will and go about it
must i go show them my unbarb d sconce
must i with my base tongue give to my noble heart a lie that it must bear
well i will do t yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throw t against the wind
you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to th life
come come we ll prompt you
i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before
away my disposition and possess me some harlot s spirit
my throat of war be turn d which quier d with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep
the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight
a beggar s tongue make motion through my lips and my arm d knees who bow d but in my stirrup bend like his that hath receiv d an alms
i will not do t lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body s action teach my mind a most inherent baseness
to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them
let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou
thy valiantness was mine thou suck dst it from me but owe thy pride thyself
mother i am going to the market place chide me no more
i ll mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home belov d of all the trades in rome
i ll return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i th way of flattery further
arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepar d with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet
let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour
well mildly be it then mildly
the forum enter sicinius and brutus brutus
in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power
if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was ne er distributed
enter an aedile what will he come
with old menenius and those senators that always favour d him
have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procur d set down by th poll
have you corrected them by tribes
assemble presently the people hither and when they hear me say it shall be so i th right and strength o th commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry fine
insisting on the old prerogative and power i th truth o th cause
and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confus d enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence
make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give t them
exit aedile put him to choler straight
he hath been us d ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction being once chaf d he cannot be rein d again to temperance then he speaks what s in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck
enter coriolanus menenius and cominius with others sicinius
ay as an ostler that for th poorest piece will bear the knave by th volume
th honour d gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men
throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war
re enter the aedile with the plebeians sicinius
shall i be charg d no further than this present
i do demand if you submit you to the people s voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be prov d upon you
lo citizens he says he is content
the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i th holy churchyard
scratches with briers scars to move laughter only
consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you
what is the matter that being pass d for consul with full voice i am so dishonour d that the very hour you take it off again
say then tis true i ought so
we charge you that you have contriv d to take from rome all season d office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people
the fires i th lowest hell fold in the people
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hands clutch d as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods
to th rock to th rock with him
we need not put new matter to his charge
what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves th extremest death
but since he hath serv d well for rome coriolanus
what do you prate of service
i talk of that that know it
is this the promise that you made your mother
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to have t with saying good morrow
for that he has as much as in him lies from time to time envied against the people seeking means to pluck away their power as now at last given hostile strokes and that not in the presence of dreaded justice but on the ministers that do distribute it in the name o th people and in the power of us the tribunes we ev n from this instant banish him our city in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates
i th people s name i say it shall be so
it shall be so it shall be so
he s banish d and it shall be so
hear me my masters and my common friends sicinius
he s sentenc d no more hearing
i have been consul and can show for rome her enemies marks upon me
i do love my country s good with a respect more tender more holy and profound than mine own life my dear wife s estimate her womb s increase and treasure of my loins
then if i would speak that sicinius
there s no more to be said but he is banish d as enemy to the people and his country
it shall be so it shall be so
you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o th rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you
and here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair
have the power still to banish your defenders till at length your ignorance which finds not till it feels making but reservation of yourselves still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows
despising for you the city thus i turn my back there is a world elsewhere
exeunt coriolanus cominius menenius with the other patricians aedile
the people s enemy is gone is gone
they all shout and throw up their caps plebeians
our enemy is banish d he is gone
go see him out at gates and follow him as he hath follow d you with all despite give him deserv d vexation
let a guard attend us through the city
come come let s see him out at gates come
the gods preserve our noble tribunes
before a gate of the city enter coriolanus volumnia virgilia menenius cominius with the young nobility of rome coriolanus
come leave your tears a brief farewell
the beast with many heads butts me away
nay mother where is your ancient courage
you were us d to say extremities was the trier of spirits that common chances common men could bear that when the sea was calm all boats alike show d mastership in floating fortune s blows when most struck home being gentle wounded craves a noble cunning
you were us d to load me with precepts that would make invincible the heart that conn d them
now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome and occupations perish
i shall be lov d when i am lack d
nay mother resume that spirit when you were wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules six of his labours you d have done and sav d your husband so much sweat
thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger man s and venomous to thine eyes
my sometime general i have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld heart hard ning spectacles tell these sad women tis fond to wail inevitable strokes as tis to laugh at em
my mother you wot well my hazards still have been your solace and believe t not lightly though i go alone like to a lonely dragon that his fen makes fear d and talk d of more than seen your son will or exceed the common or be caught with cautelous baits and practice
my first son whither wilt thou go
take good cominius with thee awhile determine on some course more than a wild exposture to each chance that starts i th way before thee
i ll follow thee a month devise with the where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us and we of thee so if the time thrust forth a cause for thy repeal we shall not send o er the vast world to seek a single man and lose advantage which doth ever cool i th absence of the needer
fare ye well thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full of the wars surfeits to go rove with one that s yet unbruis d bring me but out at gate
come my sweet wife my dearest mother and my friends of noble touch when i am forth bid me farewell and smile
while i remain above the ground you shall hear from me still and never of me aught but what is like me formerly
that s worthily as any ear can hear
if i could shake off but one seven years from these old arms and legs by the good gods i d with thee every foot
a street near the gate enter the two tribunes sicinius and brutus with the aedile sicinius
bid them all home he s gone and we ll no further
the nobility are vex d whom we see have sided in his behalf
now we have shown our power let us seem humbler after it is done than when it was a doing
say their great enemy is gone and they stand in their ancient strength
exit aedile here comes his mother
enter volumnia virgilia and menenius sicinius
they have ta en note of us keep on your way
o y are well met th hoarded plague o th gods requite your love
peace peace be not so loud
if that i could for weeping you should hear nay and you shall hear some
to brutus will you be gone
to sicinius you shall stay too
i would i had the power to say so to my husband
ay fool is that a shame
note but this fool was not a man my father
hadst thou foxship to banish him that struck more blows for rome than thou hast spoken words
moe noble blows than ever thou wise words and for rome s good
i ll tell thee what yet go
nay but thou shalt stay too
i would my son were in arabia and thy tribe before him his good sword in his hand
he d make an end of thy posterity
good man the wounds that he does bear for rome
i would he had continued to his country as he began and not unknit himself the noble knot he made
twas you incens d the rabble cats that can judge as fitly of his worth as i can of those mysteries which heaven will not have earth to know
now pray sir get you gone you have done a brave deed
ere you go hear this as far as doth the capitol exceed the meanest house in rome so far my son this lady s husband here this do you see whom you have banish d does exceed you an
well well we ll leave you
why stay we to be baited with one that wants her wits
i would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses
could i meet em but once a day it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to t
you have told them home and by my troth you have cause
anger s my meat i sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding
leave this faint puling and lament as i do in anger juno like
a highway between rome and antium enter a roman and a volsce meeting roman
i know you well sir and you know me your name i think is adrian
i am a roman and my services are as you are against em
you had more beard when i last saw you but your favour is well appear d by your tongue
what s the news in rome
i have a note from the volscian state to find you out there
you have well saved me a day s journey
there hath been in rome strange insurrections the people against the senators patricians and nobles
our state thinks not so they are in a most warlike preparation and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division
the main blaze of it is past but a small thing would make it flame again for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever
this lies glowing i can tell you and is almost mature for the violent breaking out
you will be welcome with this intelligence nicanor
the day serves well for them now
i have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man s wife is when she s fall n out with her husband
your noble tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars his great opposer coriolanus being now in no request of his country
i am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you you have ended my business and i will merrily accompany you home
i shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from rome all tending to the good of their adversaries
have you an army ready say you
a most royal one the centurions and their charges distinctly billeted already in th entertainment and to be on foot at an hour s warning
i am joyful to hear of their readiness and am the man i think that shall set them in present action
so sir heartily well met and most glad of your company
you take my part from me sir
i have the most cause to be glad of yours
before aufidius house enter coriolanus in mean apparel disguis d and muffled coriolanus
a goodly city is this antium
city tis i that made thy widows many an heir of these fair edifices fore my wars have i heard groan and drop
lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones in puny battle slay me
enter a citizen save you sir
direct me if it be your will where great aufidius lies
he is and feasts the nobles of the state at his house this night
which is his house beseech you
exit citizen o world thy slippery turns
friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twin as twere in love unseparable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues
so with me my birthplace hate i and my love s upon this enemy town
if he slay me he does fair justice if he give me way i ll do his country service
i think our fellows are asleep
exit enter another servingman second servant where s cotus
the feast smells well but i appear not like a guest
re enter the first servingman first servant
here s no place for you pray go to the door
i have deserv d no better entertainment in being coriolanus
re enter second servingman second servant
has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions
i ll have you talk d with anon
the first meets him third servant
a strange one as ever i look d on
i cannot get him out o th house
prithee call my master to him
what have you to do here fellow
let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth
pray you poor gentleman take up some other station here s no place for you
follow your function go and batten on cold bits
pushes him away from him third servant
prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here
i th city of kites and crows
i th city of kites and crows
then thou dwell st with daws too
no i serve not thy master
do you meddle with my master
ay tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress
thou prat st and prat st serve with thy trencher hence
beats him away enter aufidius with the second servingman aufidius
here sir i d have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within
unmuffling if tullus not yet thou know st me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself
a name unmusical to the volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine
thou has a grim appearance and thy face bears a command in t though thy tackle s torn thou show st a noble vessel
prepare thy brow to frown know st thou me yet
my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus
the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me
only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devour d the rest an suffer d me by th voice of slaves to be whoop d out of rome
now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me not to save my life for if i had fear d death of all the men i th world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here
then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn
so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cank red country with the spleen of all the under fiends
but if so be thou dar st not this and that to prove more fortunes th art tir d then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followed thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy country s breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy
if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true i d not believe them more than thee all noble marcius
let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr d the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour
know thou first i lov d the maid i married never man sigh d truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold
why thou mars i tell the we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm for t
thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other s throat and wak d half dead with nothing
worthy marcius had we no other quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banish d we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o erbeat
o come go in and take our friendly senators by th hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepar d against your territories though not for rome itself
absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take th one half of my commission and set down as best thou art experienc d since thou know st thy country s strength and weakness thine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy
but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires
and more a friend than e er an enemy yet marcius that was much
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two servingmen come forward first servant
by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him
he turn d me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought i cannot tell how to term it
he had so looking as it were would i were hang d but i thought there was more in him than i could think
so did i i ll be sworn
he is simply the rarest man i th world
i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on
nay it s no matter for that
nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier
faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent
ay and for an assault too
re enter the third servingman third servant
o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals
i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lief be a condemn d man
why here s he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius
why do you say thwack our general
i do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him
come we are fellows and friends
he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself
he was too hard for him directly to say the troth on t before corioli he scotch d him and notch d him like a carbonado
an he had been cannibally given he might have broil d and eaten him too
why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o th table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him
our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with s hand and turns up the white o th eye to his discourse
but the bottom of the news is our general is cut i th middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table
he ll go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by th ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage poll d
and he s as like to do t as any man i can imagine
he will do t for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he s in directitude
but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel an with him
you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips
why then we shall have a stirring world again
this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad makers
let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night it s spritely waking audible and full of vent
peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mull d deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war s a destroyer of men
tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds
ay and it makes men hate one another
reason because they then less need one another
i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians
they are rising they are rising
a public place enter the two tribunes sicinius and brutus sicinius
we hear not of him neither need we fear him
the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer by t behold dissentious numbers pest ring streets than see our tradesmen singing in their shops and going about their functions friendly
we stood to t in good time
o he is grown most kind of late
your coriolanus is not much miss d but with his friends
the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it
all s well and might have been much better he could have temporiz d
nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him
enter three or four citizens citizens
god den to you all god den to you an
ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both
farewell kind neighbours we wish d coriolanus had lov d you as we did
this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion
caius marcius was a worthy officer i the war but insolent o ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking self loving sicinius
and affecting one sole throne without assistance
we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so
the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him
worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with several powers are ent red in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before em
tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshell d when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out
come what talk you of marcius
go see this rumourer whipp d
it cannot be the volsces dare break with us
we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like hath been within my age
but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded
the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senate house some news is come that turns their countenances
tis this slave go whip him fore the people s eyes his raising nothing but his report
yes worthy sir the slave s report is seconded and more more fearful is deliver d
it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not know that marcius join d with aufidius leads a power gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the young st and oldest thing
rais d only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again
he and aufidius can no more atone than violent st contrariety
enter a second messenger second messenger
you are sent for to the senate
a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already o erborne their way consum d with fire and took what lay before them
o you have made good work
you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonour d to your noses menenius
your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confin d into an auger s bore
you have made fair work i fear me
if marcius should be join d wi th volscians cominius
he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies
you have made good work you and your apron men you that stood so much upon the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic eaters
he ll shake your rome about your ears
as hercules did shake down mellow fruit
ay and you ll look pale before you find it other
all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resists are mock d for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools
who is t can blame him
your enemies and his find something in him
we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy
the tribunes cannot do t for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they charg d him even as those should do that had deserv d his hate and therein show d fike enemies
tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease
you have made fair hands you and your crafts
you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never s incapable of help
we lov d him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o th city
but i fear they ll roar him in again
tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer
desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them
enter a troop of citizens menenius
you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile
now he s coming and not a hair upon a soldier s head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices
tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserv d it
for mine own part when i said banish him i said twas pity
and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us
that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will
y are goodly things you voices
you have made good work you and your cry
go masters get you be not dismay d these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear
go home and show no sign of fear
the gods be good to us
i ever said we were i th wrong when we banish d him
i do not like this news
would half my wealth would buy this for a lie
a camp at a short distance from rome enter aufidius with his lieutenant aufidius
do they still fly to th roman
i do not know what witchcraft s in him but your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are dark ned in this action sir even by your own
i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design
he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that s no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended
yet i wish sir i mean for your particular you had not join d in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely
i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him
although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragon like and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine whene er we come to our account
sir i beseech you think you he ll carry rome
all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too
the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence
i think he ll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature
first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even
whether twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from th casque to th cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll d the war but one of these as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him made him fear d so hated and so banish d
but he has a merit to choke it in the utt rance
so our virtues lie in th interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair t extol what it hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
when caius rome is thine thou art poor st of all then shortly art thou mine
exeunt act v scene i rome
a public place enter menenius cominius sicinius and brutus the two tribunes with others menenius
you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who lov d him in a most dear particular
he call d me father but what o that
go you that banish d him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy
nay if he coy d to hear cominius speak i ll keep at home
he would not seem to know me
yet one time he did call me by my name
i urg d our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together
coriolanus he would not answer to forbid all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forg d himself a name i th fire of burning rome
a pair of tribunes that have wrack d for rome to make coals cheap a noble memory
i minded him how royal twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish d
i offer d to awaken his regard for s private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff
he said twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose th offence
for one poor grain or two
his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon
we must be burnt for you
nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so never needed help yet do not upbraid s with our distress
but sure if you would be your country s pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman
only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius
well and say that marcius return me as cominius is return d unheard what then
but as a discontented friend grief shot with his unkindness
yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well
i ll undertake t i think he ll hear me
yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
he was not taken well he had not din d the veins unfill d our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuff d these pipes and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priest like fasts
therefore i ll watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i ll set upon him
you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way
good faith i ll prove him speed how it will
i shall ere long have knowledge of my success
i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity
i kneel d before him twas very faintly he said rise dismiss d me thus with his speechless hand
what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country
therefore let s hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on
the volscian camp before rome enter menenius to the watch on guard first watch
you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus
you may not pass you must return
our general will no more hear from thence
you ll see your rome embrac d with fire before you ll speak with coriolanus
good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touch d your ears it is menenius
the virtue of your name is not here passable
i tell thee fellow thy general is my lover
i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his fame unparallel d haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom he s chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer
nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stamp d the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass
faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely
prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general
howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass
has he din d canst thou tell
for i would not speak with him till after dinner
you are a roman are you
i am as thy general is
then you should hate rome as he does
can you when you have push d out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decay d dotant as you seem to be
can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this
no you are deceiv d therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution
you are condemn d our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon
sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation
come my captain knows you not
my general cares not for you
back i say go lest i let forth your half pint of blood
back that s the utmost of your having
nay but fellow fellow enter coriolanus with aufidius coriolanus
now you companion i ll say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from my son coriolanus
guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand st not i th state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what s to come upon thee
the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does
thou art preparing fire for us look thee here s water to quench it
i was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee i have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy petitionary countrymen
the good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee
wife mother child i know not
my affairs are servanted to others
though i owe my revenge properly my remission lies in volscian breasts
that we have been familiar ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather than pity note how much
mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force
yet for i lov d thee take this along i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have sent it
another word menenius i will not hear thee speak
this man aufidius was my belov d in rome yet thou behold st
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius first watch
now sir is your name menenius
tis a spell you see of much power
you know the way home again
do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back
what cause do you think i have to swoon
i neither care for th world nor your general for such things as you i can scarce think there s any y are so slight
he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another
let your general do his worst
for you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age
i say to you as i was said to away
a noble fellow i warrant him
the worthy fellow is our general he s the rock the oak not to be wind shaken
the tent of coriolanus enter coriolanus aufidius and others coriolanus
we will before the walls of rome to morrow set down our host
my partner in this action you must report to th volscian lords how plainly i have borne this business
only their ends you have respected stopp d your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you
this last old man whom with crack d heart i have sent to rome lov d me above the measure of a father nay godded me indeed
their latest refuge was to send him for whose old love i have though i show d sourly to him once more offer d the first conditions which they did refuse and cannot now accept
to grace him only that thought he could do more a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits nor from the state nor private friends hereafter will i lend ear to
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time tis made
enter in mourning habits virgilia volumnia valeria young marcius with attendants my wife comes foremost then the honour d mould wherein this trunk was fram d and in her hand the grandchild to her blood
all bond and privilege of nature break
let it be virtuous to be obstinate
or those doves eyes which can make gods forsworn
i melt and am not of stronger earth than others
my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not
let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy i ll never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin
these eyes are not the same i wore in rome
the sorrow that delivers us thus chang d makes you think so
like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace
best of my flesh forgive my tyranny but do not say for that forgive our romans
o a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge
now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss i carried from thee dear and my true lip hath virgin d it e er since
i prate and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted
sink my knee i th earth kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons
whilst with no softer cushion than the flint i kneel before thee and unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent
your knees to me to your corrected son
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun murd ring impossibility to make what cannot be slight work
thou art my warrior i holp to frame thee
the noble sister of publicola the moon of rome chaste as the icicle that s curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian s temple dear valeria
this is a poor epitome of yours which by th interpretation of full time may show like all yourself
the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable and stick i th wars like a great sea mark standing every flaw and saving those that eye thee
even he your wife this lady and myself are suitors to you
or if you d ask remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials
do not bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome s mechanics
tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not t allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons
you have said you will not grant us any thing for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us
aufidius and you volsces mark for we ll hear nought from rome in private
should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile
think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his country s bowels out
and to poor we thine enmity s most capital thou bar st us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy
for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound
alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country
we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles through our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy country s ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children s blood
for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i can not persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust to t thou shalt not on thy mother s womb that brought thee to this world
ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time
a shall not tread on me
i ll run away till i am bigger but then i ll fight
not of a woman s tenderness to be requires nor child nor woman s face to see
nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour
no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have show d the romans this we receiv d and each in either side give the all hail to thee and cry be blest for making up this peace
thou know st great son the end of war s uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be dogg d with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wip d it out destroy d his country and his name remains to th ensuing age abhorr d
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o th air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak
think st thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs
daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping
speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons
there s no man in the world more bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate like one i th stocks
thou hast never in thy life show d thy dear mother any courtesy when she poor hen fond of no second brood has cluck d thee to the wars and safely home loaden with honour
say my request s unjust and spurn me back but if it he not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrain st from me the duty which to a mother s part belongs
down ladies let us shame him with our knees
to his surname coriolanus longs more pride than pity to our prayers
an end this is the last
so we will home to rome and die among our neighbours
this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up hands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny t
this fellow had a volscian to his mother his wife is in corioli and his child like him by chance
i am hush d until our city be afire and then i ll speak a little
he holds her by the hand silent coriolanus
behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at
you have won a happy victory to rome but for your son believe it o believe it most dangerously you have with him prevail d if not most mortal to him
aufidius though i cannot make true wars i ll frame convenient peace
now good aufidius were you in my stead would you have heard a mother less or granted less aufidius
i dare be sworn you were
and sir it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion
but good sir what peace you fl make advise me
for my part i ll not to rome i ll back with you and pray you stand to me in this cause
aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour at difference in thee
out of that i ll work myself a former fortune
to the ladies ay by and by but we will drink together and you shall bear a better witness back than words which we on like conditions will have counter seal d
ladies you deserve to have a temple built you
all the swords in italy and her confederate arms could not have made this peace
a public place enter menenius and sicinius menenius
see you yond coign o th capitol yond cornerstone
if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of rome especially his mother may prevail with him
but i say there is no hope in t our throats are sentenc d and stay upon execution
is t possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub
this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he s more than a creeping thing
he lov d his mother dearly
so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse
the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading
he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery
he sits in his state as a thing made for alexander
what he bids be done is finish d with his bidding
he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in
yes mercy if you report him truly
i paint him in the character
mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him
there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find
and all this is long of you
the gods be good unto us
no in such a case the gods will not be good unto us
when we banish d him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us
sir if you d save your life fly to your house
the plebeians have got your fellow tribune and hale him up and down all swearing if the roman ladies bring not comfort home they ll give him death by inches
the ladies have prevail d the volscians are dislodg d and marcius gone
a merrier day did never yet greet rome no not th expulsion of the tarquins
friend art thou certain this is true
as certain as i know the sun is fire
where have you lurk d that you make doubt of it
ne er through an arch so hurried the blown tide as the recomforted through th gates
trumpets hautboys drums beat all together the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes tabors and cymbals and the shouting romans make the sun dance
i will go meet the ladies
this volumnia is worth of consuls senators patricians a city full of tribunes such as you a sea and land full
you have pray d well to day this morning for ten thousand of your throats i d not have given a doit
sound still with the shouts sicinius
first the gods bless you for your tidings next accept my thankfulness
sir we have all great cause to give great thanks
we ll meet them and help the joy
a street near the gate enter two senators with volumnia virgilia valeria passing over the stage with other lords first senator
behold our patroness the life of rome
call all your tribes together praise the gods and make triumphant fires strew flowers before them

a public place enter tullus aufidius with attendents aufidius
go tell the lords o th city i am here deliver them this paper having read it bid them repair to th market place where i even in theirs and in the commons ears will vouch the truth of it
him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter d and intends t appear before the people hoping to purge himself with words
exeunt attendants enter three or four conspirators of aufidius faction most welcome
how is it with our general
even so as with a man by his own alms empoison d and with his charity slain
most noble sir if you do hold the same intent wherein you wish d us parties we ll deliver you of your great danger
sir i cannot tell we must proceed as we do find the people
the people will remain uncertain whilst twixt you there s difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all
i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction
i rais d him and i pawn d mine honour for his truth who being so heighten d he watered his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bow d his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free
sir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping aufidius
that i would have spoken of
being banish d for t he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat
i took him made him joint servant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men serv d his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong
till at the last i seem d his follower not partner and he wag d me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary
the army marvell d at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we look d for no less spoil than glory aufidius
there was it for which my sinews shall be stretch d upon him
at a few drops of women s rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and i ll renew me in his fall
drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the people first conspirator
your native town you enter d like a post and had no welcomes home but he returns splitting the air with noise
and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glory
therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second
when he lies along after your way his tale pronounc d shall bury his reasons with his body
say no more here come the lords
enter the lords of the city lords
i have not deserv d it
but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you
what faults he made before the last i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies answering us with our own charge making a treaty where there was a yielding this admits no excuse
he approaches you shall hear him
enter coriolanus marching with drum and colours the commoners being with him coriolanus
i am return d your soldier no more infected with my country s love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command
you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome
our spoils we have brought home doth more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action
we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to th romans and we here deliver subscrib d by th consuls and patricians together with the seal o th senate what we have compounded on
read it not noble lords but tell the traitor in the highest degree he hath abus d your powers
dost thou think i ll grace thee with that robbery thy stol n name coriolanus in corioli
you lords and heads o th state perfidiously he has betray d your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city rome i say your city to his wife and mother breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk never admitting counsel o th war but at his nurse s tears he whin d and roar d away your victory that pages blush d at him and men of heart look d wond ring each at others
name not the god thou boy of tears coriolanus
measureless liar thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it
pardon me lords tis the first time that ever i was forc d to scold
your judgments my grave lords must give this cur the lie and his own notion who wears my stripes impress d upon him that must bear my beating to his grave shall join to thrust the lie unto him
peace both and hear me speak
cut me to pieces volsces men and lads stain all your edges on me
if you have writ your annals true tis there that like an eagle in a dove cote i flutter d your volscians in corioli
why noble lords will you be put in mind of his blind fortune which was your shame by this unholy braggart fore your own eyes and ears
he kill d my cousin marcus
the man is noble and his fame folds in this orb o th earth
his last offences to us shall have judicious hearing
stand aufidius and trouble not the peace
o that i had him with six aufidiuses or more his tribe to use my lawful sword
kill kill kill kill kill him
the conspirators draw and kill coriolanus who falls
my noble masters hear me speak
thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep
masters all be quiet put up your swords
my lords when you shall know as in this rage provok d by him you cannot the great danger which this man s life did owe you you ll rejoice that he is thus cut off
please it your honours to call me to your senate i ll deliver myself your loyal servant or endure your heaviest censure
bear from hence his body and mourn you for him
let him be regarded as the most noble corse that ever herald did follow to his um
his own impatience takes from aufidius a great part of blame
let s make the best of it
my rage is gone and i am struck with sorrow
help three o th chiefest soldiers i ll be one
beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully trail your steel pikes
though in this city he hath widowed and unchilded many a one which to this hour bewail the injury yet he shall have a noble memory

a mountainous country with a cave

you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods no more obey the heavens than our courtiers still seem as does the king’s
his daughter and the heir of’s kingdom whom he purpos’d to his wife’s sole son—a widow that late he married—hath referr’d herself unto a poor but worthy gentleman
she’s wedded her husband banish’d she imprison’d
all is outward sorrow though i think the king be touch’d at very heart
he that hath lost her too
so is the queen that most desir’d the match
but not a courtier although they wear their faces to the bent of the king’s looks hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at
he that hath miss’d the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her— i mean that married her alack good man
and therefore banish’d—is a creature such as to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like there would be something failing in him that should compare
i do not think so fair an outward and such stuff within endows a man but he
i do extend him sir within himself crush him together rather than unfold his measure duly
i cannot delve him to the root his father was call’d sicilius who did join his honour against the romans with cassibelan but had his titles by tenantius whom he serv’d with glory and admir’d success so gain’d the sur addition leonatus and had besides this gentleman in question two other sons who in the wars o’ th’ time died with their swords in hand for which their father then old and fond of issue took such sorrow that he quit being and his gentle lady big of this gentleman our theme deceas’d as he was born
the king he takes the babe to his protection calls him posthumus leonatus breeds him and makes him of his bed chamber puts to him all the learnings that his time could make him the receiver of which he took as we do air fast as ’twas minist’red and in’s spring became a harvest liv’d in court— which rare it is to do—most prais’d most lov’d a sample to the youngest to th’ more mature a glass that feated them and to the graver a child that guided dotards
to his mistress for whom he now is banish’d her own price proclaims how she esteem’d him and his virtue by her election may be truly read what kind of man he is
i honour him even out of your report
but pray you tell me is she sole child to th’ king
he had two sons—if this be worth your hearing mark it—the eldest of them at three years old i’ th’ swathing clothes the other from their nursery were stol’n and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went
that a king’s children should be so convey’d so slackly guarded and the search so slow that could not trace them
howsoe’er ’tis strange or that the negligence may well be laugh’d at yet is it true sir
we must forbear here comes the gentleman the queen and princess
no be assur’d you shall not find me daughter after the slander of most stepmothers evil ey’d unto you
you’re my prisoner but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys that lock up your restraint
for you posthumus so soon as i can win th’ offended king i will be known your advocate
marry yet the fire of rage is in him and ’twere good you lean’d unto his sentence with what patience your wisdom may inform you
please your highness i will from hence today
i’ll fetch a turn about the garden pitying the pangs of barr’d affections though the king hath charg’d you should not speak together
how fine this tyrant can tickle where she wounds
my dearest husband i something fear my father’s wrath but nothing always reserv’d my holy duty what his rage can do on me
you must be gone and i shall here abide the hourly shot of angry eyes not comforted to live but that there is this jewel in the world that i may see again
o lady weep no more lest i give cause to be suspected of more tenderness than doth become a man
i will remain the loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth my residence in rome at one philario’s who to my father was a friend to me known but by letter thither write my queen and with mine eyes i’ll drink the words you send though ink be made of gall
if the king come i shall incur i know not how much of his displeasure
aside yet i’ll move him to walk this way
i never do him wrong but he does buy my injuries to be friends pays dear for my offences
should we be taking leave as long a term as yet we have to live the loathness to depart would grow
were you but riding forth to air yourself such parting were too petty
look here love this diamond was my mother’s take it heart but keep it till you woo another wife when imogen is dead
you gentle gods give me but this i have and sear up my embracements from a next with bonds of death
remain remain thou here puts on the ring while sense can keep it on
and sweetest fairest as i my poor self did exchange for you to your so infinite loss so in our trifles i still win of you
for my sake wear this it is a manacle of love i’ll place it upon this fairest prisoner
puts a bracelet on her arm imogen
thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight if after this command thou fraught the court with thy unworthiness thou diest
the gods protect you and bless the good remainders of the court
there cannot be a pinch in death more sharp than this is
o disloyal thing that shouldst repair my youth thou heap’st a year’s age on me
i beseech you sir harm not yourself with your vexation
i am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare subdues all pangs all fears
past hope and in despair that way past grace
that mightst have had the sole son of my queen
o blessed that i might not
i chose an eagle and did avoid a puttock
thou took’st a beggar wouldst have made my throne a seat for baseness
no i rather added a lustre to it
sir it is your fault that i have lov’d posthumus
you bred him as my playfellow and he is a man worth any woman overbuys me almost the sum he pays
would i were a neat herd’s daughter and my leonatus our neighbour shepherd’s son
to the queen they were again together
you have done not after our command
away with her and pen her up
peace dear lady daughter peace —sweet sovereign leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort out of your best advice
nay let her languish a drop of blood a day and being aged die of this folly
my lord your son drew on my master
no harm i trust is done
there might have been but that my master rather play’d than fought and had no help of anger they were parted by gentlemen at hand
your son’s my father’s friend he takes his part to draw upon an exile
i would they were in afric both together myself by with a needle that i might prick the goer back
why came you from your master
he would not suffer me to bring him to the haven left these notes of what commands i should be subject to when’t pleas’d you to employ me
this hath been your faithful servant
i dare lay mine honour he will remain so
about some half hour hence pray you speak with me
you shall at least go see my lord aboard
sir i would advise you to shift a shirt the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice
where air comes out air comes in there’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent
if my shirt were bloody then to shift it
aside no faith not so much as his patience
his body’s a passable carcass if he be not hurt
it is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt
aside his steel was in debt it went o’ th’ backside the town
the villain would not stand me
aside no but he fled forward still toward your face
you have land enough of your own but he added to your having gave you some ground
aside as many inches as you have oceans
i would they had not come between us
aside so would i till you had measur’d how long a fool you were upon the ground
and that she should love this fellow and refuse me
aside if it be a sin to make a true election she is damn’d
sir as i told you always her beauty and her brain go not together she’s a good sign but i have seen small reflection of her wit
aside she shines not upon fools lest the reflection should hurt her
would there had been some hurt done
aside i wish not so unless it had been the fall of an ass which is no great hurt
i would thou grew’st unto the shores o’ th’ haven and questioned’st every sail if he should write and i not have it ’twere a paper lost as offer’d mercy is
what was the last that he spake to thee
it was his queen his queen
senseless linen happier therein than i
no madam for so long as he could make me with his eye or ear distinguish him from others he did keep the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief still waving as the fits and stirs of’s mind could best express how slow his soul sail’d on how swift his ship
thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to after eye him
i would have broke mine eyestrings crack’d them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followed him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turn’d mine eye and wept
but good pisanio when shall we hear from him
be assur’d madam with his next vantage
i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say
ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour or have charg’d him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight t’ encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing
the queen madam desires your highness’ company
those things i bid you do get them dispatch’d
enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard
believe it sir i have seen him in britain
he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of
but i could then have look’d on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items
you speak of him when he was less furnish’d than now he is with that which makes him both without and within
i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
this matter of marrying his king’s daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter
ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgement which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality
but how comes it he is to sojourn with you
his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life
let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality
i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine
how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing
sir we have known together in orleans
since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still
sir you o’errate my poor kindness
i was glad i did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature
i was then a young traveller rather shunn’d to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others’ experiences but upon my mended judgement if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight
faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall’n both
can we with manners ask what was the difference
’twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report
it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france
that lady is not now living or this gentleman’s opinion by this worn out
she holds her virtue still and i my mind
you must not so far prefer her ’fore ours of italy
being so far provok’d as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend
as fair and as good—a kind of hand in hand comparison—had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain
if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady
i prais’d her as i rated her
what do you esteem it at
either your unparagon’d mistress is dead or she’s outpriz’d by a trifle
you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods
which the gods have given you
which by their graces i will keep
you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds
your ring may be stol’n too
so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplish’d courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
your italy contains none so accomplish’d a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail
i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring
this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend
i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o’ervalues it something
but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world
you are a great deal abus’d in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what y’are worthy of by your attempt
a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too
it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted
would i had put my estate and my neighbour’s on th’ approbation of what i have spoke
what lady would you choose to assail
yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe
i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv’d
i will wage against your gold gold to it
my ring i hold dear as my finger ’tis part of it
you are a friend and therein the wiser
if you buy ladies’ flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting
but i see you have some religion in you that you fear
this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope
i am the master of my speeches and would undergo what’s spoken i swear
i shall but lend my diamond till your return
let there be covenants drawn between’s
my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking
i dare you to this match here’s my ring
i will have it no lay
by the gods it is one
if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoy’d the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too
if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment
i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us
only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail’d i am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduc’d you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th’ assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword
we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve
i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded
signior iachimo will not from it
whiles yet the dew’s on ground gather those flowers make haste who has the note of them
exeunt ladies now master doctor have you brought those drugs
presenting a box but i beseech your grace without offence my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have commanded of me these most poisonous compounds which are the movers of a languishing death but though slow deadly
i wonder doctor thou ask’st me such a question
have i not been thy pupil long
hast thou not learn’d me how to make perfumes
yea so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections
having thus far proceeded unless thou think’st me devilish is’t not meet that i did amplify my judgement in other conclusions
i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects
your highness shall from this practice but make hard your heart besides the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious
aside here comes a flattering rascal upon him will i first work
he’s for his master an enemy to my son
doctor your service for this time is ended take your own way
aside i do suspect you madam but you shall do no harm
to pisanio hark thee a word
aside i do not like her
she doth think she has strange ling’ring poisons
i do know her spirit and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damn’d nature
those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile which first perchance she’ll prove on cats and dogs then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes more than the locking up the spirits a time to be more fresh reviving
she is fool’d with a most false effect and i the truer so to be false with her
no further service doctor until i send for thee
dost thou think in time she will not quench and let instructions enter where folly now possesses
when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son i’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then as great as is thy master greater for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name is at last gasp
return he cannot nor continue where he is
to shift his being is to exchange one misery with another and every day that comes comes to decay a day’s work in him
what shalt thou expect to be depender on a thing that leans who cannot be new built nor has no friends so much as but to prop him
pisanio takes it up thou tak’st up thou know’st not what but take it for thy labour
it is a thing i made which hath the king five times redeem’d from death
i do not know what is more cordial
nay i prithee take it it is an earnest of a further good that i mean to thee
tell thy mistress how the case stands with her do’t as from thyself
think what a chance thou changest on but think thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son who shall take notice of thee
i’ll move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as thou’lt desire and then myself i chiefly that set thee on to this desert am bound to load thy merit richly
exit pisanio a sly and constant knave not to be shak’d the agent for his master and the remembrancer of her to hold the hand fast to her lord
i have given him that which if he take shall quite unpeople her of liegers for her sweet and which she after except she bend her humour shall be assur’d to taste of too
the violets cowslips and the primroses bear to my closet
fare thee well pisanio think on my words
but when to my good lord i prove untrue i’ll choke myself there’s all i’ll do for you
a father cruel and a step dame false a foolish suitor to a wedded lady that hath her husband banish’d
and those repeated vexations of it
had i been thief stol’n as my two brothers happy
but most miserable is the desire that’s glorious
blessed be those how mean soe’er that have their honest wills which seasons comfort
madam a noble gentleman of rome comes from my lord with letters
the worthy leonatus is in safety and greets your highness dearly
aside all of her that is out of door most rich
if she be furnish’d with a mind so rare she is alone th’ arabian bird and i have lost the wager
arm me audacity from head to foot
or like the parthian i shall flying fight rather directly fly
reads he is one of the noblest note to whose kindnesses i am most infinitely tied
reflect upon him accordingly as you value your trust
leonatus so far i read aloud but even the very middle of my heart is warm’d by th’ rest and takes it thankfully
you are as welcome worthy sir as i have words to bid you and shall find it so in all that i can do
hath nature given them eyes to see this vaulted arch and the rich crop of sea and land which can distinguish ’twixt the fiery orbs above and the twinn’d stones upon the number’d beach and can we not partition make with spectacles so precious ’twixt fair and foul
it cannot be i’ th’ eye for apes and monkeys ’twixt two such shes would chatter this way and contemn with mows the other nor i’ th’ judgement for idiots in this case of favour would be wisely definite nor i’ th’ appetite sluttery to such neat excellence oppos’d should make desire vomit emptiness not so allur’d to feed
the cloyed will— that satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub both fill’d and running—ravening first the lamb longs after for the garbage
what dear sir thus raps you
beseech you sir desire my man’s abode where i did leave him
i was going sir to give him welcome
exceeding pleasant none a stranger there so merry and so gamesome
he is call’d the briton reveller
when he was here he did incline to sadness and oft times not knowing why
there is a frenchman his companion one an eminent monsieur that it seems much loves a gallian girl at home
he furnaces the thick sighs from him whiles the jolly briton your lord i mean laughs from’s free lungs cries “o can my sides hold to think that man who knows by history report or his own proof what woman is yea what she cannot choose but must be will’s free hours languish for assured bondage ” imogen
ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman
but heavens know some men are much to blame
not he but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might be us’d more thankfully
in himself ’tis much in you which i account his beyond all talents
whilst i am bound to wonder i am bound to pity too
you look on me what wreck discern you in me deserves your pity
what to hide me from the radiant sun and solace i’ th’ dungeon by a snuff
i pray you sir deliver with more openness your answers to my demands
that others do i was about to say enjoy your—but it is an office of the gods to venge it not mine to speak on’t
you do seem to know something of me or what concerns me pray you since doubting things go ill often hurts more than to be sure they do for certainties either are past remedies or timely knowing the remedy then born—discover to me what both you spur and stop
my lord i fear has forgot britain
not i inclin’d to this intelligence pronounce the beggary of his change but ’tis your graces that from my mutest conscience to my tongue charms this report out
o dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart with pity that doth make me sick
a lady so fair and fasten’d to an empery would make the great’st king double to be partner’d with tomboys hir’d with that self exhibition which your own coffers yield
with diseas’d ventures that play with all infirmities for gold which rottenness can lend nature
such boil’d stuff as well might poison poison
be reveng’d or she that bore you was no queen and you recoil from your great stock
if this be true as i have such a heart that both mine ears must not in haste abuse if it be true how should i be reveng’d
should he make me live like diana’s priest betwixt cold sheets whiles he is vaulting variable ramps in your despite upon your purse
i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure more noble than that runagate to your bed and will continue fast to your affection still close as sure
let me my service tender on your lips
i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee
if thou wert honourable thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not for such an end thou seek’st as base as strange
thou wrong’st a gentleman who is as far from thy report as thou from honour and solicits here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike
the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault
if he shall think it fit a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us he hath a court he little cares for and a daughter who he not respects at all
i may say the credit that thy lady hath of thee deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness her assur’d credit
blessed live you long a lady to the worthiest sir that ever country call’d his
and you his mistress only for the most worthiest fit
i have spoke this to know if your affiance were deeply rooted and shall make your lord that which he is new o’er and he is one the truest manner’d such a holy witch that he enchants societies into him half all men’s hearts are his
he sits ’mongst men like a descended god he hath a kind of honour sets him off more than a mortal seeming
be not angry most mighty princess that i have adventur’d to try your taking of a false report which hath honour’d with confirmation your great judgement in the election of a sir so rare which you know cannot err
the love i bear him made me to fan you thus but the gods made you unlike all others chaffless
all’s well sir take my pow’r i’ th’ court for yours
i had almost forgot t’ entreat your grace but in a small request and yet of moment too for it concerns your lord myself and other noble friends are partners in the business
some dozen romans of us and your lord the best feather of our wing have mingled sums to buy a present for the emperor which i the factor for the rest have done in france
’tis plate of rare device and jewels of rich and exquisite form their values great and i am something curious being strange to have them in safe stowage
may it please you to take them in protection
willingly and pawn mine honour for their safety
since my lord hath interest in them i will keep them in my bedchamber
they are in a trunk attended by my men
i will make bold to send them to you only for this night i must aboard tomorrow
yes i beseech or i shall short my word by length’ning my return
from gallia i cross’d the seas on purpose and on promise to see your grace
i thank you for your pains
therefore i shall beseech you if you please to greet your lord with writing do’t tonight
i have outstood my time which is material to th’ tender of our present
send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept and truly yielded you
exeunt act ii scene i britain
enter cloten and the two lords
was there ever man had such luck
when i kiss’d the jack upon an upcast to be hit away
i had a hundred pound on’t and then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing as if i borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure
you have broke his pate with your bowl
aside if his wit had been like him that broke it it would have run all out
when a gentleman is dispos’d to swear it is not for any standers by to curtail his oaths
no my lord aside nor crop the ears of them
would he had been one of my rank
aside to have smell’d like a fool
i am not vex’d more at anything in th’ earth
i had rather not be so noble as i am they dare not fight with me because of the queen my mother
every jackslave hath his bellyful of fighting and i must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match
aside you are cock and capon too and you crow cock with your comb on
it is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you give offence to
no i know that but it is fit i should commit offence to my inferiors
ay it is fit for your lordship only
did you hear of a stranger that’s come to court tonight
a stranger and i not known on’t
aside he’s a strange fellow himself and knows it not
there’s an italian come and ’tis thought one of leonatus’ friends
a banish’d rascal and he’s another whatsoever he be
who told you of this stranger
is it fit i went to look upon him
aside you are a fool granted therefore your issues being foolish do not derogate
come i’ll go see this italian
what i have lost today at bowls i’ll win tonight of him
exeunt cloten and first lord that such a crafty devil as is his mother should yield the world this ass
a woman that bears all down with her brain and this her son cannot take two from twenty for his heart and leave eighteen
alas poor princess thou divine imogen what thou endur’st betwixt a father by thy step dame govern’d a mother hourly coining plots a wooer more hateful than the foul expulsion is of thy dear husband than that horrid act of the divorce he’d make
the heavens hold firm the walls of thy dear honour keep unshak’d that temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand t’ enjoy thy banish’d lord and this great land
imogen’s bedchamber in cymbeline’s palace a trunk in one corner
enter immogen in her bed and a lady attending
i have read three hours then
mine eyes are weak fold down the leaf where i have left
take not away the taper leave it burning and if thou canst awake by four o’ th’ clock i prithee call me
exit lady to your protection i commend me gods
from fairies and the tempters of the night guard me beseech ye
iachimo comes from the trunk iachimo
the crickets sing and man’s o’er labour’d sense repairs itself by rest
our tarquin thus did softly press the rushes ere he waken’d the chastity he wounded
cytherea how bravely thou becom’st thy bed
fresh lily and whiter than the sheets
rubies unparagon’d how dearly they do’t
’tis her breathing that perfumes the chamber thus
the flame o’ th’ taper bows toward her and would under peep her lids to see th’ enclosed lights now canopied under these windows white and azure lac’d with blue of heaven’s own tinct
but my design to note the chamber
i will write all down such and such pictures there the window such th’ adornment of her bed the arras figures why such and such and the contents o’ th’ story
ah but some natural notes about her body above ten thousand meaner movables would testify t’ enrich mine inventory
o sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
and be her sense but as a monument thus in a chapel lying
come off come off taking off her bracelet as slippery as the gordian knot was hard
’tis mine and this will witness outwardly as strongly as the conscience does within to th’ madding of her lord
on her left breast a mole cinque spotted like the crimson drops i’ th’ bottom of a cowslip
here’s a voucher stronger than ever law could make this secret will force him think i have pick’d the lock and ta’en the treasure of her honour
why should i write this down that’s riveted screw’d to my memory
she hath been reading late the tale of tereus here the leaf’s turn’d down where philomel gave up
to th’ trunk again and shut the spring of it
swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning may bare the raven’s eye
i lodge in fear though this a heavenly angel hell is here
exit into the trunk scene iii
an ante chamber adjoining imogen’s apartments
your lordship is the most patient man in loss the most coldest that ever turn’d up ace
it would make any man cold to lose
but not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship
you are most hot and furious when you win
winning will put any man into courage
if i could get this foolish imogen i should have gold enough
i would this music would come
i am advised to give her music a mornings they say it will penetrate
if you can penetrate her with your fingering so
if none will do let her remain but i’ll never give o’er
first a very excellent good conceited thing after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich words to it and then let her consider
the lark at heaven’s gate sings and phœbus ’gins arise his steeds to water at those springs on chalic’d flow’rs that lies and winking mary buds begin to ope their golden eyes
with everything that pretty is my lady sweet arise arise arise
if this penetrate i will consider your music the better if it do not it is a vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves’ guts nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot can never amend
exeunt musicians enter cymbeline and queen
i am glad i was up so late for that’s the reason i was up so early
he cannot choose but take this service i have done fatherly —good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother
attend you here the door of our stern daughter
i have assail’d her with musics but she vouchsafes no notice
the exile of her minion is too new she hath not yet forgot him some more time must wear the print of his remembrance on’t and then she’s yours
you are most bound to th’ king who lets go by no vantages that may prefer you to his daughter
frame yourself to orderly solicits and be friended with aptness of the season make denials increase your services so seem as if you were inspir’d to do those duties which you tender to her that you in all obey her save when command to your dismission tends and therein you are senseless
so like you sir ambassadors from rome the one is caius lucius
a worthy fellow albeit he comes on angry purpose now but that’s no fault of his
we must receive him according to the honour of his sender and towards himself his goodness forespent on us we must extend our notice
our dear son when you have given good morning to your mistress attend the queen and us we shall have need t’ employ you towards this roman
if she be up i’ll speak with her if not let her lie still and dream
knocks i know her women are about her what if i do line one of their hands
’tis gold which buys admittance oft it doth yea and makes diana’s rangers false themselves yield up their deer to th’ stand o’ th’ stealer and ’tis gold which makes the true man kill’d and saves the thief nay sometime hangs both thief and true man
what can it not do and undo
i will make one of her women lawyer to me for i yet not understand the case myself
that’s more than some whose tailors are as dear as yours can justly boast of
your lady’s person is she ready
there is gold for you sell me your good report
or to report of you what i shall think is good
you lay out too much pains for purchasing but trouble
the thanks i give is telling you that i am poor of thanks and scarce can spare them
still i swear i love you
if you but said so ’twere as deep with me
if you swear still your recompense is still that i regard it not
but that you shall not say i yield being silent i would not speak
faith i shall unfold equal discourtesy to your best kindness one of your great knowing should learn being taught forbearance
to leave you in your madness ’twere my sin i will not
as i am mad i do if you’ll be patient i’ll no more be mad that cures us both
i am much sorry sir you put me to forget a lady’s manners by being so verbal and learn now for all that i which know my heart do here pronounce by th’ very truth of it i care not for you and am so near the lack of charity to accuse myself i hate you which i had rather you felt than make’t my boast
you sin against obedience which you owe your father
for the contract you pretend with that base wretch one bred of alms and foster’d with cold dishes with scraps o’ th’ court it is no contract none
and though it be allowed in meaner parties yet who than he more mean
to knit their souls on whom there is no more dependency but brats and beggary in self figur’d knot yet you are curb’d from that enlargement by the consequence o’ th’ crown and must not foil the precious note of it with a base slave a hilding for a livery a squire’s cloth a pantler not so eminent
wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides thou wert too base to be his groom
thou wert dignified enough even to the point of envy if ’twere made comparative for your virtues to be styl’d the under hangman of his kingdom and hated for being preferr’d so well
he never can meet more mischance than come to be but nam’d of thee
his mean’st garment that ever hath but clipp’d his body is dearer in my respect than all the hairs above thee were they all made such men
to dorothy my woman hie thee presently
i am sprited with a fool frighted and ang’red worse
go bid my woman search for a jewel that too casually hath left mine arm
it was thy master’s shrew me if i would lose it for a revenue of any king’s in europe
i do think i saw’t this morning confident i am last night ’twas on mine arm i kiss’d it
i hope it be not gone to tell my lord that i kiss aught but he
if you will make ’t an action call witness to ’t
she’s my good lady and will conceive i hope but the worst of me
so i leave you sir to th’ worst of discontent
fear it not sir i would i were so sure to win the king as i am bold her honour will remain hers
what means do you make to him
not any but abide the change of time quake in the present winter’s state and wish that warmer days would come
in these fear’d hopes i barely gratify your love they failing i must die much your debtor
your very goodness and your company o’erpays all i can do
by this your king hath heard of great augustus
caius lucius will do’s commission throughly and i think he’ll grant the tribute send th’ arrearages or look upon our romans whose remembrance is yet fresh in their grief
i do believe statist though i am none nor like to be that this will prove a war and you shall hear the legions now in gallia sooner landed in our not fearing britain than have tidings of any penny tribute paid
our countrymen are men more order’d than when julius cæsar smil’d at their lack of skill but found their courage worthy his frowning at
their discipline now mingled with their courages will make known to their approvers they are people such that mend upon the world
the swiftest harts have posted you by land and winds of all the corners kiss’d your sails to make your vessel nimble
i hope the briefness of your answer made the speediness of your return
your lady is one of the fairest that i have look’d upon
and therewithal the best or let her beauty look through a casement to allure false hearts and be false with them
was caius lucius in the britain court when you were there
he was expected then but not approach’d
sparkles this stone as it was wont or is’t not too dull for your good wearing
if i have lost it i should have lost the worth of it in gold
i’ll make a journey twice as far t’ enjoy a second night of such sweet shortness which was mine in britain for the ring is won
the stone’s too hard to come by
not a whit your lady being so easy
make not sir your loss your sport
i hope you know that we must not continue friends
good sir we must if you keep covenant
had i not brought the knowledge of your mistress home i grant we were to question farther but i now profess myself the winner of her honour together with your ring and not the wronger of her or you having proceeded but by both your wills
if you can make’t apparent that you have tasted her in bed my hand and ring is yours
if not the foul opinion you had of her pure honour gains or loses your sword or mine or masterless leaves both to who shall find them
sir my circumstances being so near the truth as i will make them must first induce you to believe whose strength i will confirm with oath which i doubt not you’ll give me leave to spare when you shall find you need it not
first her bedchamber where i confess i slept not but profess had that was well worth watching it was hang’d with tapestry of silk and silver the story proud cleopatra when she met her roman and cydnus swell’d above the banks or for the press of boats or pride
a piece of work so bravely done so rich that it did strive in workmanship and value which i wonder’d could be so rarely and exactly wrought since the true life on’t was— posthumus
this is true and this you might have heard of here by me or by some other
more particulars must justify my knowledge
so they must or do your honour injury
the chimney is south the chamber and the chimneypiece chaste dian bathing
never saw i figures so likely to report themselves
the cutter was as another nature dumb outwent her motion and breath left out
this is a thing which you might from relation likewise reap being as it is much spoke of
the roof o’ th’ chamber with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons i had forgot them were two winking cupids of silver each on one foot standing nicely depending on their brands
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise be given to your remembrance the description of what is in her chamber nothing saves the wager you have laid
then if you can shows the bracelet be pale
i beg but leave to air this jewel
it must be married to that your diamond i’ll keep them
once more let me behold it
is it that which i left with her
she stripp’d it from her arm i see her yet her pretty action did outsell her gift and yet enrich’d it too
she gave it me and said she priz’d it once
may be she pluck’d it of to send it me
she writes so to you doth she
here take this too gives the ring it is a basilisk unto mine eye kills me to look on’t
let there be no honour where there is beauty truth where semblance love where there’s another man
the vows of women of no more bondage be to where they are made than they are to their virtues which is nothing
have patience sir and take your ring again ’tis not yet won
it may be probable she lost it or who knows if one her women being corrupted hath stol’n it from her
very true and so i hope he came by’t
render to me some corporal sign about her more evident than this for this was stol’n
by jupiter i had it from her arm
hark you he swears by jupiter he swears
’tis true nay keep the ring ’tis true
i am sure she would not lose it
her attendants are all sworn and honourable —they induc’d to steal it
the cognizance of her incontinency is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell divide themselves between you
sir be patient this is not strong enough to be believ’d of one persuaded well of
never talk on’t she hath been colted by him
if you seek for further satisfying under her breast worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud of that most delicate lodging
by my life i kiss’d it and it gave me present hunger to feed again though full
you do remember this stain upon her
ay and it doth confirm another stain as big as hell can hold were there no more but it
spare your arithmetic never count the turns
if you will swear you have not done’t you lie and i will kill thee if thou dost deny thou’st made me cuckold
o that i had her here to tear her limb meal
i will go there and do’t i’ th’ court before her father
quite besides the government of patience
let’s follow him and pervert the present wrath he hath against himself
is there no way for men to be but women must be half workers
we are all bastards and that most venerable man which i did call my father was i know not where when i was stamp’d
some coiner with his tools made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem’d the dian of that time
so doth my wife the nonpareil of this
me of my lawful pleasure she restrain’d and pray’d me oft forbearance did it with a pudency so rosy the sweet view on’t might well have warm’d old saturn that i thought her as chaste as unsunn’d snow
this yellow iachimo in an hour was’t not
perchance he spoke not but like a full acorn’d boar a german one cried “o ” and mounted found no opposition but what he look’d for should oppose and she should from encounter guard
could i find out the woman’s part in me
for there’s no motion that tends to vice in man but i affirm it is the woman’s part
be it lying note it the woman’s flattering hers deceiving hers lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers ambitions covetings change of prides disdain nice longing slanders mutability all faults that man may name nay that hell knows why hers in part or all but rather all for even to vice they are not constant but are changing still one vice but of a minute old for one not half so old as that
i’ll write against them detest them curse them
yet ’tis greater skill in a true hate to pray they have their will the very devils cannot plague them better
exit act iii scene i britain
enter in state cymbeline queen cloten and lords at one door and at another caius lucius and attendants
now say what would augustus cæsar with us
when julius cæsar whose remembrance yet lives in men’s eyes and will to ears and tongues be theme and hearing ever was in this britain and conquer’d it cassibelan thine uncle famous in cæsar’s praises no whit less than in his feats deserving it for him and his succession granted rome a tribute yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately is left untender’d
and to kill the marvel shall be so ever
there be many cæsars ere such another julius
britain is a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses
that opportunity which then they had to take from’s to resume we have again
remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptune’s park ribb’d and pal’d in with rocks unscaleable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats but suck them up to th’ top mast
a kind of conquest cæsar made here but made not here his brag of ‘came and saw and overcame ’ with shame the first that ever touch’d him he was carried from off our coast twice beaten and his shipping poor ignorant baubles
on our terrible seas like egg shells mov’d upon their surges crack’d as easily ’gainst our rocks for joy whereof the fam’d cassibelan who was once at point o giglot fortune
to master cæsar’s sword made lud’s town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage
come there’s no more tribute to be paid
our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as i said there is no moe such cæsars
other of them may have crook’d noses but to owe such straight arms none
we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as cassibelan
i do not say i am one but i have a hand
if cæsar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now
you must know till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us we were free
cæsar’s ambition which swell’d so much that it did almost stretch the sides o’ th’ world against all colour here did put the yoke upon’s which to shake of becomes a warlike people whom we reckon ourselves to be
say then to cæsar our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordain’d our laws whose use the sword of cæsar hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise shall by the power we hold be our good deed though rome be therefore angry
mulmutius made our laws who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and call’d himself a king
i am sorry cymbeline that i am to pronounce augustus cæsar cæsar that hath moe kings his servants than thyself domestic officers thine enemy
receive it from me then war and confusion in cæsar’s name pronounce i ’gainst thee look for fury not to be resisted
thus defied i thank thee for myself
thy cæsar knighted me my youth i spent much under him of him i gather’d honour which he to seek of me again perforce behoves me keep at utterance
i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so cæsar shall not find them
make pastime with us a day or two or longer
if you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our salt water girdle
if you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there’s an end
i know your master’s pleasure and he mine all the remain is welcome
enter pisanio reading of a letter
wherefore write you not what monsters her accuse
o master what a strange infection is fall’n into thy ear
what false italian as poisonous tongu’d as handed hath prevail’d on thy too ready hearing
she’s punish’d for her truth and undergoes more goddess like than wife like such assaults as would take in some virtue
o my master thy mind to her is now as low as were thy fortunes
upon the love and truth and vows which i have made to thy command
if it be so to do good service never let me be counted serviceable
how look i that i should seem to lack humanity so much as this fact comes to
the letter that i have sent her by her own command shall give thee opportunity ’ o damn’d paper black as the ink that’s on thee
senseless bauble art thou a fedary for this act and look’st so virgin like without
i am ignorant in what i am commanded
madam here is a letter from my lord
o learn’d indeed were that astronomer that knew the stars as i his characters he’d lay the future open
you good gods let what is here contain’d relish of love of my lord’s health of his content yet not that we two are asunder let that grieve him
some griefs are med’cinable that is one of them for it doth physic love of his content all but in that
blest be you bees that make these locks of counsel
lovers and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike though forfeiters you cast in prison yet you clasp young cupid’s tables
reads justice and your father’s wrath should he take me in his dominion could not be so cruel to me as you o the dearest of creatures would even renew me with your eyes
take notice that i am in cambria at milford haven
what your own love will out of this advise you follow
so he wishes you all happiness that remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love
leonatus posthumus o for a horse with wings
read and tell me how far ’tis thither
if one of mean affairs may plod it in a week why may not i glide thither in a day
then true pisanio who long’st like me to see thy lord who long’st o let me ’bate
but not like me yet long’st but in a fainter kind
o not like me for mine’s beyond beyond say and speak thick love’s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing to th’ smothering of the sense how far it is to this same blessed milford
and by th’ way tell me how wales was made so happy as t’ inherit such a haven
but first of all how we may steal from hence and for the gap that we shall make in time from our hence going and our return to excuse
why should excuse be born or ere begot
prithee speak how many score of miles may we well rid ’twixt hour and hour
one score ’twixt sun and sun madam ’s enough for you and too much too
why one that rode to’s execution man could never go so slow
i have heard of riding wagers where horses have been nimbler than the sands that run i’ th’ clock’s behalf
go bid my woman feign a sickness say she’ll home to her father and provide me presently a riding suit no costlier than would fit a franklin’s huswife
nor here nor here nor what ensues but have a fog in them that i cannot look through
away i prithee do as i bid thee
accessible is none but milford way
a mountainous country with a cave
enter from the cave belarius guiderius and arviragus
a goodly day not to keep house with such whose roof’s as low as ours
stoop boys this gate instructs you how t’ adore the heavens and bows you to a morning’s holy office
the gates of monarchs are arch’d so high that giants may jet through and keep their impious turbans on without good morrow to the sun
we house i’ th’ rock yet use thee not so hardly as prouder livers do
up to yond hill your legs are young i’ll tread these flats
consider when you above perceive me like a crow that it is place which lessens and sets off and you may then revolve what tales i have told you of courts of princes of the tricks in war
this service is not service so being done but being so allow’d
to apprehend thus draws us a profit from all things we see and often to our comfort shall we find the sharded beetle in a safer hold than is the full wing’d eagle
o this life is nobler than attending for a check richer than doing nothing for a robe prouder than rustling in unpaid for silk such gain the cap of him that makes him fine yet keeps his book uncross’d
out of your proof you speak
we poor unfledg’d have never wing’d from view o’ th’ nest nor know not what air’s from home
haply this life is best if quiet life be best sweeter to you that have a sharper known well corresponding with your stiff age
but unto us it is a cell of ignorance travelling abed a prison for a debtor that not dares to stride a limit
what should we speak of when we are old as you
when we shall hear the rain and wind beat dark december how in this our pinching cave shall we discourse
we have seen nothing we are beastly subtle as the fox for prey like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
our valour is to chase what flies our cage we make a choir as doth the prison’d bird and sing our bondage freely
did you but know the city’s usuries and felt them knowingly the art o’ th’ court as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb is certain falling or so slipp’ry that the fear’s as bad as falling the toil o’ th’ war a pain that only seems to seek out danger i’ th’ name of fame and honour which dies i’ th’ search and hath as oft a sland’rous epitaph as record of fair act nay many times doth ill deserve by doing well what’s worse must curtsy at the censure
o boys this story the world may read in me my body’s mark’d with roman swords and my report was once first with the best of note
cymbeline lov’d me and when a soldier was the theme my name was not far off
then was i as a tree whose boughs did bend with fruit
but in one night a storm or robbery call it what you will shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves and left me bare to weather
my fault being nothing as i have told you oft but that two villains whose false oaths prevail’d before my perfect honour swore to cymbeline i was confederate with the romans
so follow’d my banishment and this twenty years this rock and these demesnes have been my world where i have liv’d at honest freedom paid more pious debts to heaven than in all the fore end of my time
he that strikes the venison first shall be the lord o’ th’ feast to him the other two shall minister and we will fear no poison which attends in place of greater state
i’ll meet you in the valleys
exeunt guiderius and arviragus how hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
these boys know little they are sons to th’ king nor cymbeline dreams that they are alive
they think they are mine and though train’d up thus meanly i’ th’ cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit the roofs of palaces and nature prompts them in simple and low things to prince it much beyond the trick of others
this polydore the heir of cymbeline and britain who the king his father call’d guiderius—jove
when on my three foot stool i sit and tell the warlike feats i have done his spirits fly out into my story say ‘thus mine enemy fell and thus i set my foot on’s neck’ even then the princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture that acts my words
the younger brother cadwal once arviragus in as like a figure strikes life into my speech and shows much more his own conceiving
o cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows thou didst unjustly banish me
whereon at three and two years old i stole these babes thinking to bar thee of succession as thou refts me of my lands
euriphile thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother and every day do honour to her grave
myself belarius that am morgan call’d they take for natural father
thou told’st me when we came from horse the place was near at hand
ne’er long’d my mother so to see me first as i have now
what is in thy mind that makes thee stare thus
wherefore breaks that sigh from th’ inward of thee
one but painted thus would be interpreted a thing perplex’d beyond self explication
put thyself into a haviour of less fear ere wildness vanquish my staider senses
why tender’st thou that paper to me with a look untender
if’t be summer news smile to’t before if winterly thou need’st but keep that count’nance still
that drug damn’d italy hath out craftied him and he’s at some hard point
speak man thy tongue may take off some extremity which to read would be even mortal to me
please you read and you shall find me wretched man a thing the most disdain’d of fortune
reads thy mistress pisanio hath play’d the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me
i speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as i expect my revenge
that part thou pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers
let thine own hands take away her life i shall give thee opportunity at milford haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pandar to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal pisanio
what shall i need to draw my sword
the paper hath cut her throat already
no ’tis slander whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath rides on the posting winds and doth belie all corners of the world
kings queens and states maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave this viperous slander enters
what is it to be false
to lie in watch there and to think on him
to weep twixt clock and clock
if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake
that’s false to’s bed is it
iachimo thou didst accuse him of incontinency thou then look’dst like a villain now methinks thy favour’s good enough
some jay of italy whose mother was her painting hath betray’d him
poor i am stale a garment out of fashion and for i am richer than to hang by th’ walls i must be ripp’d
o men’s vows are women’s traitors
all good seeming by thy revolt o husband shall be thought put on for villainy not born where’t grows but worn a bait for ladies
true honest men being heard like false æneas were in his time thought false and sinon’s weeping did scandal many a holy tear took pity from most true wretchedness
so thou posthumus wilt lay the leaven on all proper men goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur’d from thy great fail
come fellow be thou honest do thou thy master’s bidding when thou seest him a little witness my obedience
i draw the sword myself take it and hit the innocent mansion of my love my heart
fear not ’tis empty of all things but grief thy master is not there who was indeed the riches of it
thou mayst be valiant in a better cause but now thou seem’st a coward
thou shalt not damn my hand
why i must die and if i do not by thy hand thou art no servant of thy master’s
against self slaughter there is a prohibition so divine that cravens my weak hand
come here’s my heart something’s afore’t
we’ll no defence obedient as the scabbard
the scriptures of the loyal leonatus all turn’d to heresy
away away corrupters of my faith you shall no more be stomachers to my heart
thus may poor fools believe false teachers though those that are betray’d do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor stands in worse case of woe
and thou posthumus that didst set up my disobedience ’gainst the king my father and make me put into contempt the suits of princely fellows shalt hereafter find it is no act of common passage but a strain of rareness and i grieve myself to think when thou shalt be disedg’d by her that now thou tirest on how thy memory will then be pang’d by me
thou art too slow to do thy master’s bidding when i desire it too
o gracious lady since i receiv’d command to do this busines i have not slept one wink
why hast thou abus’d so many miles with a pretence
the perturb’d court for my being absent
why hast thou gone so far to be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand th’ elected deer before thee
but to win time to lose so bad employment in the which i have consider’d of a course
good lady hear me with patience
i have heard i am a strumpet and mine ear therein false struck can take no greater wound nor tent to bottom that
then madam i thought you would not back again
most like bringing me here to kill me
not so neither but if i were as wise as honest then my purpose would prove well
it cannot be but that my master is abus’d
some villain ay and singular in his art hath done you both this cursed injury
i’ll give but notice you are dead and send him some bloody sign of it for ’tis commanded i should do so
you shall be miss’d at court and that will well confirm it
why good fellow what shall i do the while
or in my life what comfort when i am dead to my husband
if you’ll back to th’ court— imogen
no court no father nor no more ado with that harsh noble simple nothing that cloten whose love suit hath been to me as fearful as a siege
if not at court then not in britain must you bide
hath britain all the sun that shines
day night are they not but in britain
i’ th’ world’s volume our britain seems as of it but not in’t in a great pool a swan’s nest
prithee think there’s livers out of britain
i am most glad you think of other place
th’ ambassador lucius the roman comes to milford haven tomorrow
now if you could wear a mind dark as your fortune is and but disguise that which t’ appear itself must not yet be but by self danger you should tread a course pretty and full of view yea happily near the residence of posthumus so nigh at least that though his actions were not visible yet report should render him hourly to your ear as truly as he moves
for such means though peril to my modesty not death on’t i would adventure
well then here’s the point you must forget to be a woman change command into obedience fear and niceness the handmaids of all women or more truly woman it pretty self into a waggish courage ready in gibes quick answer’d saucy and as quarrelous as the weasel
nay you must forget that rarest treasure of your cheek exposing it but o the harder heart
alack no remedy to the greedy touch of common kissing titan and forget your laboursome and dainty trims wherein you made great juno angry
nay be brief i see into thy end and am almost a man already
first make yourself but like one
fore thinking this i have already fit ’tis in my cloak bag doublet hat hose all that answer to them
would you in their serving and with what imitation you can borrow from youth of such a season ’fore noble lucius present yourself desire his service tell him wherein you’re happy which will make him know if that his head have ear in music doubtless with joy he will embrace you for he’s honourable and doubling that most holy
your means abroad you have me rich and i will never fail beginning nor supplyment
thou art all the comfort the gods will diet me with
there’s more to be consider’d but we’ll even all that good time will give us
this attempt i am soldier to and will abide it with a prince’s courage
well madam we must take a short farewell lest being miss’d i be suspected of your carriage from the court
my noble mistress here is a box i had it from the queen
if you are sick at sea or stomach qualm’d at land a dram of this will drive away distemper
to some shade and fit you to your manhood
may the gods direct you to the best
enter cymbeline queen cloten lucius and lords
my emperor hath wrote i must from hence and am right sorry that i must report ye my master’s enemy
our subjects sir will not endure his yoke and for ourself to show less sovereignty than they must needs appear unkinglike
i desire of you a conduct overland to milford haven
madam all joy befall your grace and you
my lords you are appointed for that office the due of honour in no point omit
receive it friendly but from this time forth i wear it as your enemy
sir the event is yet to name the winner
leave not the worthy lucius good my lords till he have cross’d the severn
he goes hence frowning but it honours us that we have given him cause
’tis all the better your valiant britons have their wishes in it
lucius hath wrote already to the emperor how it goes here
it fits us therefore ripely our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness
the pow’rs that he already hath in gallia will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves his war for britain
’tis not sleepy business but must be look’d to speedily and strongly
our expectation that it would be thus hath made us forward
but my gentle queen where is our daughter
she hath not appear’d before the roman nor to us hath tender’d the duty of the day
she looks us like a thing more made of malice than of duty we have noted it
call her before us for we have been too slight in sufferance
royal sir since the exile of posthumus most retir’d hath her life been the cure whereof my lord ’tis time must do
beseech your majesty forbear sharp speeches to her she’s a lady so tender of rebukes that words are strokes and strokes death to her
how can her contempt be answer’d
please you sir her chambers are all lock’d and there’s no answer that will be given to th’ loud of noise we make
my lord when last i went to visit her she pray’d me to excuse her keeping close whereto constrain’d by her infirmity she should that duty leave unpaid to you which daily she was bound to proffer
this she wish’d me to make known but our great court made me to blame in memory
grant heavens that which i fear prove false
son i say follow the king
that man of hers pisanio her old servant i have not seen these two days
exit cloten pisanio thou that stand’st so for posthumus
he hath a drug of mine
i pray his absence proceed by swallowing that for he believes it is a thing most precious
but for her where is she gone
haply despair hath seiz’d her or wing’d with fervour of her love she’s flown to her desir’d posthumus
gone she is to death or to dishonour and my end can make good use of either
she being down i have the placing of the british crown
go in and cheer the king
he rages none dare come about him
may this night forestall him of the coming day
i love and hate her for she’s fair and royal and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite than lady ladies woman
from every one the best she hath and she of all compounded outsells them all
i love her therefore but disdaining me and throwing favours on the low posthumus slanders so her judgement that what’s else rare is chok’d and in that point i will conclude to hate her nay indeed to be reveng’d upon her
for when fools shall— enter pisanio
in a word or else thou art straightway with the fiends
or by jupiter— i will not ask again
close villain i’ll have this secret from thy heart or rip thy heart to find it
from whose so many weights of baseness cannot a dram of worth be drawn
alas my lord how can she be with him
satisfy me home what is become of her
discover where thy mistress is at once at the next word
speak or thy silence on the instant is thy condemnation and thy death
then sir this paper is the history of my knowledge touching her flight
i will pursue her even to augustus’ throne
she’s far enough and what he learns by this may prove his travel not her danger
aside i’ll write to my lord she’s dead
o imogen safe mayst thou wander safe return again
it is posthumus’ hand i know’t
sirrah if thou wouldst not be a villain but do me true service undergo those employments wherein i should have cause to use thee with a serious industry—that is what villainy soe’er i bid thee do to perform it directly and truly—i would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment
for since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar posthumus thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine
give me thy hand here’s my purse
hast any of thy late master’s garments in thy possession
i have my lord at my lodging the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress
the first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither
let it be thy first service go
i forgot to ask him one thing i’ll remember’t anon
even there thou villain posthumus will i kill thee
i would these garments were come
she said upon a time—the bitterness of it i now belch from my heart—that she held the very garment of posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities
with that suit upon my back will i ravish her first kill him and in her eyes
there shall she see my valour which will then be a torment to her contempt
he on the ground my speech of insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined—which as i say to vex her i will execute in the clothes that she so prais’d—to the court i’ll knock her back foot her home again
she hath despis’d me rejoicingly and i’ll be merry in my revenge
how long is’t since she went to milford haven
she can scarce be there yet
bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing that i have commanded thee
the third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design
be but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself to thee
my revenge is now at milford would i had wings to follow it
thou bid’st me to my loss for true to thee were to prove false which i will never be to him that is most true
to milford go and find not her whom thou pursuest
flow flow you heavenly blessings on her
this fool’s speed be cross’d with slowness
enter imogen alone in boy’s clothes
i see a man’s life is a tedious one
i have tir’d myself and for two nights together have made the ground my bed
i should be sick but that my resolution helps me
milford when from the mountain top pisanio show’d thee thou wast within a ken
i think foundations fly the wretched such i mean where they should be reliev’d
two beggars told me i could not miss my way
will poor folks lie that have afflictions on them knowing ’tis a punishment or trial
yes no wonder when rich ones scarce tell true
to lapse in fulness is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars
thou art one o’ th’ false ones
now i think on thee my hunger’s gone but even before i was at point to sink for food
here is a path to’t ’tis some savage hold
i were best not call i dare not call
yet famine ere clean it o’erthrow nature makes it valiant
plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever of hardiness is mother
if anything that’s civil speak if savage take or lend
best draw my sword and if mine enemy but fear the sword like me he’ll scarcely look on’t
exit into the cave scene vii
you polydore have prov’d best woodman and are master of the feast
cadwal and i will play the cook and servant ’tis our match
the sweat of industry would dry and die but for the end it works to
come our stomachs will make what’s homely savoury weariness can snore upon the flint when resty sloth finds the down pillow hard
now peace be here poor house that keep’st thyself
i am weak with toil yet strong in appetite
there is cold meat i’ th’ cave we’ll browse on that whilst what we have kill’d be cook’d
looking into the cave stay come not in
but that it eats our victuals i should think here were a fairy
or if not an earthly paragon
behold divineness no elder than a boy
before i enter’d here i call’d and thought to have begg’d or bought what i have took
good troth i have stol’n nought nor would not though i had found gold strew’d i’ th’ floor
i would have left it on the board so soon as i had made my meal and parted with pray’rs for the provider
all gold and silver rather turn to dirt as ’tis no better reckon’d but of those who worship dirty gods
know if you kill me for my fault i should have died had i not made it
i have a kinsman who is bound for italy he embark’d at milford to whom being going almost spent with hunger i am fall’n in this offence
prithee fair youth think us no churls nor measure our good minds by this rude place we live in
’tis almost night you shall have better cheer ere you depart and thanks to stay and eat it
were you a woman youth i should woo hard but be your groom
in honesty i bid for you as i’d buy
i’ll make’t my comfort he is a man
i’ll love him as my brother and such a welcome as i’d give to him after long absence such is yours
be sprightly for you fall ’mongst friends
aside would it had been so that they had been my father’s sons
then had my prize been less and so more equal ballasting to thee posthumus
or i whate’er it be what pain it cost what danger
aside great men that had a court no bigger than this cave that did attend themselves and had the virtue which their own conscience seal’d them laying by that nothing gift of differing multitudes could not out peer these twain
i’d change my sex to be companion with them since leonatus false
boys we’ll go dress our hunt
discourse is heavy fasting when we have supp’d we’ll mannerly demand thee of thy story so far as thou wilt speak it
the night to th’ owl and morn to th’ lark less welcome
enter two roman senators and tribunes
this is the tenour of the emperor’s writ that since the common men are now in action ’gainst the pannonians and dalmatians and that the legions now in gallia are full weak to undertake our wars against the fall’n off britons that we do incite the gentry to this business
he creates lucius proconsul and to you the tribunes for this immediate levy he commands his absolute commission
is lucius general of the forces
with those legions which i have spoke of whereunto your levy must be supplyant
the words of your commission will tie you to the numbers and the time of their dispatch
exeunt act iv scene i wales
i am near to th’ place where they should meet if pisanio have mapp’d it truly
how fit his garments serve me
why should his mistress who was made by him that made the tailor not be fit too
the rather saving reverence of the word for ’tis said a woman’s fitness comes by fits
therein i must play the workman
i dare speak it to myself for it is not vain glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber i mean the lines of my body are as well drawn as his no less young more strong not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the advantage of the time above him in birth alike conversant in general services and more remarkable in single oppositions
yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite
posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before her face and all this done spurn her home to her father who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage but my mother having power of his testiness shall turn all into my commendations
my horse is tied up safe
out sword and to a sore purpose
fortune put them into my hand
this is the very description of their meeting place and the fellow dares not deceive me
enter from the cave belarius guiderius arviragus and imogen
to imogen you are not well
remain here in the cave we’ll come to you after hunting
so man and man should be but clay and clay differs in dignity whose dust is both alike
go you to hunting i’ll abide with him
so sick i am not yet i am not well but not so citizen a wanton as to seem to die ere sick
so please you leave me stick to your journal course
the breach of custom is breach of all
i am ill but your being by me cannot amend me society is no comfort to one not sociable
i am not very sick since i can reason of it
i’ll rob none but myself and let me die stealing so poorly
i love thee i have spoke it
how much the quantity the weight as much as i do love my father
if it be sin to say so sir i yoke me in my good brother’s fault
i know not why i love this youth and i have heard you say love’s reason’s without reason
the bier at door and a demand who is’t shall die i’d say ‘my father not this youth ’ belarius
cowards father cowards and base things sire base
nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace
i’m not their father yet who this should be doth miracle itself lov’d before me — ’tis the ninth hour o’ th’ morn
to belarius so please you sir
gods what lies i have heard
our courtiers say all’s savage but at court
th’ imperious seas breed monsters for the dish poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
i am sick still heart sick
pisanio i’ll now taste of thy drug
he said he was gentle but unfortunate dishonestly afflicted but yet honest
thus did he answer me yet said hereafter i might know more
to th’ field to th’ field
we’ll leave you for this time
pray be not sick for you must be our huswife
well or ill i am bound to you
exit imogen into the cave this youth howe’er distress’d appears he hath had good ancestors
he cut our roots in characters and sauc’d our broths as juno had been sick and he her dieter
nobly he yokes a smiling with a sigh as if the sigh was that it was for not being such a smile the smile mocking the sigh that it would fly from so divine a temple to commix with winds that sailors rail at
i do note that grief and patience rooted in him both mingle their spurs together
and let the stinking elder grief untwine his perishing root with the increasing vine
i cannot find those runagates that villain hath mock’d me
i partly know him ’tis cloten the son o’ th’ queen
i saw him not these many years and yet i know ’tis he
he is but one you and my brother search what companies are near
pray you away let me alone with him
what are you that fly me thus
a thing more slavish did i ne’er than answering a slave without a knock
thou art a robber a law breaker a villain
have not i an arm as big as thine a heart as big
thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not my dagger in my mouth
say what thou art why i should yield to thee
thou villain base know’st me not by my clothes
no nor thy tailor rascal who is thy grandfather he made those clothes which as it seems make thee
thou precious varlet my tailor made them not
hence then and thank the man that gave them thee
thou art some fool i am loath to beat thee
thou injurious thief hear but my name and tremble
cloten thou double villain be thy name i cannot tremble at it
were it toad or adder spider ’twould move me sooner
to thy further fear nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know i am son to th’ queen
i’m sorry for’t not seeming so worthy as thy birth
those that i reverence those i fear—the wise at fools i laugh not fear them
when i have slain thee with my proper hand i’ll follow those that even now fled hence and on the gates of lud’s town set your heads
exeunt fighting enter belarius and arviragus
none in the world you did mistake him sure
i cannot tell long is it since i saw him but time hath nothing blurr’d those lines of favour which then he wore the snatches in his voice and burst of speaking were as his
i am absolute ’twas very cloten
in this place we left them
i wish my brother make good time with him you say he is so fell
being scarce made up i mean to man he had not apprehension or roaring terrors for defect of judgement is oft the cease of fear
this cloten was a fool an empty purse there was no money in’t
not hercules could have knock’d out his brains for he had none yet i not doing this the fool had borne my head as i do his
i am perfect what cut off one cloten’s head son to the queen after his own report who call’d me traitor mountaineer and swore with his own single hand he’d take us in displace our heads where thank the gods they grow and set them on lud’s town
why worthy father what have we to lose but that he swore to take our lives
the law protects not us then why should we be tender to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us play judge and executioner all himself for we do fear the law
no single soul can we set eye on but in all safe reason he must have some attendants
though his humour was nothing but mutation ay and that from one bad thing to worse not frenzy not absolute madness could so far have rav’d to bring him here alone
although perhaps it may be heard at court that such as we cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time may make some stronger head the which he hearing as it is like him might break out and swear he’d fetch us in yet is’t not probable to come alone either he so undertaking or they so suffering
then on good ground we fear if we do fear this body hath a tail more perilous than the head
let ordinance come as the gods foresay it
howsoe’er my brother hath done well
i had no mind to hunt this day the boy fidele’s sickness did make my way long forth
with his own sword which he did wave against my throat i have ta’en his head from him
i’ll throw’t into the creek behind our rock and let it to the sea and tell the fishes he’s the queen’s son cloten
would polydore thou hadst not done’t
though valour becomes thee well enough
would i had done’t so the revenge alone pursu’d me
polydore i love thee brotherly but envy much thou hast robb’d me of this deed
i would revenges that possible strength might meet would seek us through and put us to our answer
we’ll hunt no more today nor seek for danger where there’s no profit
you and fidele play the cooks i’ll stay till hasty polydore return and bring him to dinner presently
i’ll willingly to him to gain his colour i’d let a parish of such cloten’s blood and praise myself for charity
o thou goddess thou divine nature thou thyself thou blazon’st in these two princely boys
they are as gentle as zephyrs blowing below the violet not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough their royal blood enchaf’d as the rud’st wind that by the top doth take the mountain pine and make him stoop to th’ vale
’tis wonder that an invisible instinct should frame them to royalty unlearn’d honour untaught civility not seen from other valour that wildly grows in them but yields a crop as if it had been sow’d
yet still it’s strange what cloten’s being here to us portends or what his death will bring us
i have sent cloten’s clotpoll down the stream in embassy to his mother his body’s hostage for his return
but what occasion hath cadwal now to give it motion
since death of my dear’st mother it did not speak before
all solemn things should answer solemn accidents
triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys is jollity for apes and grief for boys
enter arviragus with imogen as dead bearing her in his arms
look here he comes and brings the dire occasion in his arms of what we blame him for
the bird is dead that we have made so much on
i had rather have skipp’d from sixteen years of age to sixty to have turn’d my leaping time into a crutch than have seen this
my brother wears thee not the one half so well as when thou grew’st thyself
who ever yet could sound thy bottom
find the ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare might’st easiliest harbour in
jove knows what man thou mightst have made but i thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
stark as you see thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber not as death’s dart being laugh’d at his right cheek reposing on a cushion
o’ th’ floor his arms thus leagu’d
i thought he slept and put my clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness answer’d my steps too loud
if he be gone he’ll make his grave a bed with female fairies will his tomb be haunted and worms will not come to thee
with fairest flowers whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele i’ll sweeten thy sad grave
thou shalt not lack the flower that’s like thy face pale primrose nor the azur’d hare bell like thy veins no nor the leaf of eglantine whom not to slander out sweet’ned not thy breath
the ruddock would with charitable bill o bill sore shaming those rich left heirs that let their fathers lie without a monument
bring thee all this yea and furr’d moss besides when flow’rs are none to winter ground thy corse— guiderius
prithee have done and do not play in wench like words with that which is so serious
let us bury him and not protract with admiration what is now due debt
be’t so and let us polydore though now our voices have got the mannish crack sing him to th’ ground as once to our mother use like note and words save that euriphile must be fidele
i’ll weep and word it with thee for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse than priests and fanes that lie
great griefs i see med’cine the less for cloten is quite forgot
he was a queen’s son boys and though he came our enemy remember he was paid for that
though mean and mighty rotting together have one dust yet reverence that angel of the world doth make distinction of place ’tween high and low
our foe was princely and though you took his life as being our foe yet bury him as a prince
thersites’ body is as good as ajax’ when neither are alive
if you’ll go fetch him we’ll say our song the whilst
nay cadwal we must lay his head to th’ east my father hath a reason for’t
come on then and remove him
fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun nor the furious winter’s rages thou thy worldly task hast done home art gone and ta’en thy wages
golden lads and girls all must as chimney sweepers come to dust arviragus
fear no more the frown o’ th’ great thou art past the tyrant’s stroke
care no more to clothe and eat to thee the reed is as the oak
the sceptre learning physic must all follow this and come to dust guiderius
fear no more the lightning flash arviragus
nor th’ all dreaded thunder stone guiderius
fear not slander censure rash arviragus
thou hast finish’d joy and moan both
all lovers young all lovers must consign to thee and come to dust guiderius
nor no witchcraft charm thee guiderius
nothing ill come near thee both
quiet consummation have and renowned be thy grave enter belarius with the body of cloten
here’s a few flowers but ’bout midnight more
the herbs that have on them cold dew o’ th’ night are strewings fit’st for graves
you were as flow’rs now wither’d
even so these herblets shall which we upon you strew
the ground that gave them first has them again
their pleasures here are past so is their pain
awaking yes sir to milford haven
can it be six mile yet
faith i’ll lie down and sleep
seeing the body these flow’rs are like the pleasures of the world this bloody man the care on’t
i hope i dream for so i thought i was a cave keeper and cook to honest creatures
but ’tis not so ’twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing which the brain makes of fumes
our very eyes are sometimes like our judgements blind
good faith i tremble still with fear but if there be yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity as a wren’s eye fear’d gods a part of it
even when i wake it is without me as within me not imagin’d felt
i know the shape of’s leg this is his hand his foot mercurial his martial thigh the brawns of hercules but his jovial face— murder in heaven
pisanio all curses madded hecuba gave the greeks and mine to boot be darted on thee
thou conspir’d with that irregulous devil cloten hath here cut off my lord
to write and read be henceforth treacherous
damn’d pisanio hath with his forged letters damn’d pisanio from this most bravest vessel of the world struck the main top
pisanio might have kill’d thee at the heart and left this head on
’tis he and cloten malice and lucre in them have laid this woe here
the drug he gave me which he said was precious and cordial to me have i not found it murd’rous to th’ senses
this is pisanio’s deed and cloten
give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood that we the horrider may seem to those which chance to find us
falls fainting on the body enter lucius captains and a soothsayer
to them the legions garrison’d in gallia after your will have cross’d the sea attending you here at milford haven with your ships they are in readiness
the senate hath stirr’d up the confiners and gentlemen of italy most willing spirits that promise noble service and they come under the conduct of bold iachimo sienna’s brother
with the next benefit o’ th’ wind
this forwardness makes our hopes fair
command our present numbers be muster’d bid the captains look to’t
now sir what have you dream’d of late of this war’s purpose
last night the very gods show’d me a vision i fast and pray’d for their intelligence thus i saw jove’s bird the roman eagle wing’d from the spongy south to this part of the west there vanish’d in the sunbeams which portends unless my sins abuse my divination success to th’ roman host
dream often so and never false
what trunk is here without his top
the ruin speaks that sometime it was a worthy building
or dead or sleeping on him
but dead rather for nature doth abhor to make his bed with the defunct or sleep upon the dead
he’ll then instruct us of this body
young one inform us of thy fortunes for it seems they crave to be demanded
who is this thou mak’st thy bloody pillow
or who was he that otherwise than noble nature did hath alter’d that good picture
what’s thy interest in this sad wreck
i am nothing or if not nothing to be were better
this was my master a very valiant briton and a good that here by mountaineers lies slain
there is no more such masters
i may wander from east to occident cry out for service try many all good serve truly never find such another master
thou mov’st no less with thy complaining than thy master in bleeding
aside if i do lie and do no harm by it though the gods hear i hope they’ll pardon it —say you sir
thou dost approve thyself the very same thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name
wilt take thy chance with me
i will not say thou shalt be so well master’d but be sure no less belov’d
the roman emperor’s letters sent by a consul to me should not sooner than thine own worth prefer thee
but first an’t please the gods i’ll hide my master from the flies as deep as these poor pickaxes can dig and when with wild wood leaves and weeds i ha’ strew’d his grave and on it said a century of prayers such as i can twice o’er i’ll weep and sigh and leaving so his service follow you so please you entertain me
ay good youth and rather father thee than master thee
my friends the boy hath taught us manly duties let us find out the prettiest daisied plot we can and make him with our pikes and partisans a grave
boy he is preferr’d by thee to us and he shall be interr’d as soldiers can
some falls are means the happier to arise
enter cymbeline lords pisanio and attendants
and bring me word how ’tis with her
exit an attendant a fever with the absence of her son a madness of which her life’s in danger
heavens how deeply you at once do touch me
imogen the great part of my comfort gone my queen upon a desperate bed and in a time when fearful wars point at me her son gone so needful for this present
it strikes me past the hope of comfort
but for thee fellow who needs must know of her departure and dost seem so ignorant we’ll enforce it from thee by a sharp torture
sir my life is yours i humbly set it at your will but for my mistress i nothing know where she remains why gone nor when she purposes return
beseech your highness hold me your loyal servant
good my liege the day that she was missing he was here
i dare be bound he’s true and shall perform all parts of his subjection loyally
for cloten there wants no diligence in seeking him and will no doubt be found
to pisanio we’ll slip you for a season but our jealousy does yet depend
so please your majesty the roman legions all from gallia drawn are landed on your coast with a supply of roman gentlemen by the senate sent
now for the counsel of my son and queen
good my liege your preparation can affront no less than what you hear of
come more for more you’re ready
the want is but to put those pow’rs in motion that long to move
let’s withdraw and meet the time as it seeks us
we fear not what can from italy annoy us but we grieve at chances here
i heard no letter from my master since i wrote him imogen was slain
nor hear i from my mistress who did promise to yield me often tidings
neither know i what is betid to cloten but remain perplex’d in all
wherein i am false i am honest not true to be true
these present wars shall find i love my country even to the note o’ th’ king or i’ll fall in them
all other doubts by time let them be clear’d fortune brings in some boats that are not steer’d
the noise is round about us
what pleasure sir find we in life to lock it from action and adventure
nay what hope have we in hiding us
this way the romans must or for britons slay us or receive us for barbarous and unnatural revolts during their use and slay us after
sons we’ll higher to the mountains there secure us
to the king’s party there’s no going
newness of cloten’s death we being not known not muster’d among the bands may drive us to a render where we have liv’d and so extort from’s that which we have done whose answer would be death drawn on with torture
this is sir a doubt in such a time nothing becoming you nor satisfying us
it is not likely that when they hear the roman horses neigh behold their quarter’d fires have both their eyes and ears so cloy’d importantly as now that they will waste their time upon our note to know from whence we are
o i am known of many in the army
many years though cloten then but young you see not wore him from my remembrance
and besides the king hath not deserv’d my service nor your loves who find in my exile the want of breeding the certainty of this hard life aye hopeless to have the courtesy your cradle promis’d but to be still hot summer’s tanlings and the shrinking slaves of winter
than be so better to cease to be
i and my brother are not known yourself so out of thought and thereto so o’ergrown cannot be questioned
by this sun that shines i’ll thither
what thing is’t that i never did see man die
scarce ever look’d on blood but that of coward hares hot goats and venison
never bestrid a horse save one that had a rider like myself who ne’er wore rowel nor iron on his heel
i am asham’d to look upon the holy sun to have the benefit of his blest beams remaining so long a poor unknown
if you will bless me sir and give me leave i’ll take the better care but if you will not the hazard therefore due fall on me by the hands of romans
no reason i since of your lives you set so slight a valuation should reserve my crack’d one to more care
if in your country wars you chance to die that is my bed too lads and there i’ll lie
aside the time seems long their blood thinks scorn till it fly out and show them princes born
exeunt act v scene i britain
enter posthumus alone with a bloody handkerchief
yea bloody cloth i’ll keep thee for i wish’d thou shouldst be colour’d thus
you married ones if each of you should take this course how many must murder wives much better than themselves for wrying but a little
every good servant does not all commands no bond but to do just ones
if you should have ta’en vengeance on my faults i never had liv’d to put on this so had you saved the noble imogen to repent and struck me wretch more worth your vengeance
but alack you snatch some hence for little faults that’s love to have them fall no more
you some permit to second ills with ills each elder worse and make them dread it to the doers’ thrift
do your best wills and make me blest to obey
i am brought hither among th’ italian gentry and to fight against my lady’s kingdom
’tis enough that britain i have kill’d thy mistress peace
i’ll give no wound to thee
therefore good heavens hear patiently my purpose
i’ll disrobe me of these italian weeds and suit myself as does a britain peasant
so i’ll fight against the part i come with so i’ll die for thee o imogen even for whom my life is every breath a death
and thus unknown pitied nor hated to the face of peril myself i’ll dedicate
let me make men know more valour in me than my habits show
gods put the strength o’ th’ leonati in me
to shame the guise o’ th’ world i will begin the fashion less without and more within
a field of battle between the british and roman camps
enter lucius iachimo and the roman army at one door and the british army at another leonatus posthumus following like a poor soldier
they march over and go out
then enter again in skirmish iachimo and posthumus
he vanquisheth and disarmeth iachimo and then leaves him
the heaviness and guilt within my bosom takes off my manhood
i have belied a lady the princess of this country and the air on’t revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl a very drudge of nature’s have subdu’d me in my profession
knighthoods and honours borne as i wear mine are titles but of scorn
if that thy gentry britain go before this lout as he exceeds our lords the odds is that we scarce are men and you are gods
exit the battle continues the britons fly cymbeline is taken
then enter to his rescue belarius guiderius and arviragus
we have th’ advantage of the ground the lane is guarded nothing routs us but the villainy of our fears
enter posthumus and seconds the britons they rescue cymbeline and exeunt
then re enter lucius and iachimo with imogen
away boy from the troops and save thyself for friends kill friends and the disorder’s such as war were hoodwink’d
it is a day turn’d strangely
or betimes let’s reinforce or fly
enter posthumus and a briton lord
cam’st thou from where they made the stand
i did though you it seems come from the fliers
no blame be to you sir for all was lost but that the heavens fought
the king himself of his wings destitute the army broken and but the backs of britons seen all flying through a strait lane the enemy full hearted lolling the tongue with slaught’ring having work more plentiful than tools to do’t struck down some mortally some slightly touch’d some falling merely through fear that the strait pass was damm’d with dead men hurt behind and cowards living to die with length’ned shame
close by the battle ditch’d and wall’d with turf which gave advantage to an ancient soldier an honest one i warrant who deserv’d so long a breeding as his white beard came to in doing this for’s country
athwart the lane he with two striplings lads more like to run the country base than to commit such slaughter with faces fit for masks or rather fairer than those for preservation cas’d or shame made good the passage cried to those that fled ‘our britain’s harts die flying not our men
to darkness fleet souls that fly backwards
stand or we are romans and will give you that like beasts which you shun beastly and may save but to look back in frown
stand stand ’ these three three thousand confident in act as many— for three performers are the file when all the rest do nothing—with this word ‘stand stand ’ accommodated by the place more charming with their own nobleness which could have turn’d a distaff to a lance gilded pale looks part shame part spirit renew’d that some turn’d coward but by example o a sin in war damn’d in the first beginners ’gan to look the way that they did and to grin like lions upon the pikes o’ th’ hunters
then began a stop i’ th’ chaser a retire anon a rout confusion thick
forthwith they fly chickens the way which they stoop’d eagles slaves the strides they victors made and now our cowards like fragments in hard voyages became the life o’ th’ need
having found the back door open of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound
some slain before some dying some their friends o’erborne i’ th’ former wave
ten chas’d by one are now each one the slaughterman of twenty
those that would die or ere resist are grown the mortal bugs o’ th’ field
this was strange chance a narrow lane an old man and two boys
nay do not wonder at it you are made rather to wonder at the things you hear than to work any
will you rhyme upon’t and vent it for a mock’ry
here is one ‘two boys an old man twice a boy a lane preserv’d the britons was the romans’ bane ’ lord
who dares not stand his foe i’ll be his friend for if he’ll do as he is made to do i know he’ll quickly fly my friendship too
you have put me into rhyme
o noble misery to be i’ th’ field and ask ‘what news ’ of me
today how many would have given their honours to have sav’d their carcasses
took heel to do’t and yet died too
i in mine own woe charm’d could not find death where i did hear him groan nor feel him where he struck
being an ugly monster ’tis strange he hides him in fresh cups soft beds sweet words or hath moe ministers than we that draw his knives i’ th’ war
well i will find him for being now a favourer to the briton no more a briton i have resum’d again the part i came in
fight i will no more but yield me to the veriest hind that shall once touch my shoulder
great the slaughter is here made by th’ roman great the answer be britons must take
for me my ransom’s death on either side i come to spend my breath which neither here i’ll keep nor bear again but end it by some means for imogen
enter two british captains and soldiers
’tis thought the old man and his sons were angels
there was a fourth man in a silly habit that gave th’ affront with them
so ’tis reported but none of ’em can be found
a roman who had not now been drooping here if seconds had answer’d him
lay hands on him a dog
a leg of rome shall not return to tell what crows have peck’d them here
he brags his service as if he were of note
enter cymbeline belarius guiderius arviragus pisanio and roman captives
the captains present posthumus to cymbeline who delivers him over to a gaoler
you shall not now be stol’n you have locks upon you so graze as you find pasture
for thou art a way i think to liberty
yet am i better than one that’s sick o’ th’ gout since he had rather groan so in perpetuity than be cur’d by th’ sure physician death who is the key t’ unbar these locks
my conscience thou art fetter’d more than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me the penitent instrument to pick that bolt then free for ever
so children temporal fathers do appease gods are more full of mercy
must i repent i cannot do it better than in gyves desir’d more than constrain’d
to satisfy if of my freedom ’tis the main part take no stricter render of me than my all
i know you are more clement than vile men who of their broken debtors take a third a sixth a tenth letting them thrive again on their abatement that’s not my desire
for imogen’s dear life take mine and though ’tis not so dear yet ’tis a life you coin’d it
’tween man and man they weigh not every stamp though light take pieces for the figure’s sake you rather mine being yours
and so great pow’rs if you will take this audit take this life and cancel these cold bonds
i’ll speak to thee in silence
enter as in an apparition sicilius leonatus father to posthumus an old man attired like a warrior leading in his hand an ancient matron his wife and mother to posthumus with music before them
then after other music follows the two young leonati brothers to posthumus with wounds as they died in the wars
they circle posthumus round as he lies sleeping
no more thou thunder master show thy spite on mortal flies
with mars fall out with juno chide that thy adulteries rates and revenges
hath my poor boy done aught but well whose face i never saw
i died whilst in the womb he stay’d attending nature’s law whose father then as men report thou orphans’ father art thou shouldst have been and shielded him from this earth vexing smart
lucina lent not me her aid but took me in my throes that from me was posthumus ripp’d came crying ’mongst his foes a thing of pity
great nature like his ancestry moulded the stuff so fair that he deserv’d the praise o’ th’ world as great sicilius’ heir
when once he was mature for man in britain where was he that could stand up his parallel or fruitful object be in eye of imogen that best could deem his dignity
with marriage wherefore was he mock’d to be exil’d and thrown from leonati seat and cast from her his dearest one sweet imogen
why did you suffer iachimo slight thing of italy to taint his nobler heart and brain with needless jealousy and to become the geck and scorn o’ th’ other’s villainy
for this from stiller seats we came our parents and us twain that striking in our country’s cause fell bravely and were slain our fealty and tenantius’ right with honour to maintain
like hardiment posthumus hath to cymbeline perform’d
then jupiter thou king of gods why hast thou thus adjourn’d the graces for his merits due being all to dolours turn’d
thy crystal window ope look out no longer exercise upon a valiant race thy harsh and potent injuries
since jupiter our son is good take off his miseries
or we poor ghosts will cry to th’ shining synod of the rest against thy deity
or we appeal and from thy justice fly
jupiter descends in thunder and lightning sitting upon an eagle
the ghosts fall on their knees
no more you petty spirits of region low offend our hearing hush
how dare you ghosts accuse the thunderer whose bolt you know sky planted batters all rebelling coasts
poor shadows of elysium hence and rest upon your never withering banks of flow’rs
be not with mortal accidents opprest no care of yours it is you know ’tis ours
whom best i love i cross to make my gift the more delay’d delighted
be content your low laid son our godhead will uplift his comforts thrive his trials well are spent
our jovial star reign’d at his birth and in our temple was he married
he shall be lord of lady imogen and happier much by his affliction made
this tablet lay upon his breast wherein our pleasure his full fortune doth confine and so away no farther with your din express impatience lest you stir up mine
mount eagle to my palace crystalline
he came in thunder his celestial breath was sulphurous to smell the holy eagle stoop’d as to foot us
his ascension is more sweet than our blest fields
his royal bird prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak as when his god is pleas’d
the marble pavement closes he is enter’d his radiant roof
and to be blest let us with care perform his great behest
waking sleep thou has been a grandsire and begot a father to me and thou hast created a mother and two brothers
they went hence so soon as they were born
poor wretches that depend on greatness’ favour dream as i have done wake and find nothing
but alas i swerve many dream not to find neither deserve and yet are steep’d in favours so am i that have this golden chance and know not why
be not as is our fangled world a garment nobler than that it covers
let thy effects so follow to be most unlike our courtiers as good as promise
reads when as a lion’s whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embrac’d by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp’d branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty ’tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen tongue and brain not either both or nothing or senseless speaking or a speaking such as sense cannot untie
be what it is the action of my life is like it which i’ll keep if but for sympathy
come sir are you ready for death
over roasted rather ready long ago
hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are well cook’d
so if i prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot
a heavy reckoning for you sir
but the comfort is you shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth
you come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness
o of this contradiction you shall now be quit
o the charity of a penny cord
it sums up thousands in a trice
you have no true debitor and creditor but it of what’s past is and to come the discharge
your neck sir is pen book and counters so the acquittance follows
i am merrier to die than thou art to live
indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache
but a man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to bed i think he would change places with his officer for look you sir you know not which way you shall go
your death has eyes in’s head then i have not seen him so pictur’d
you must either be directed by some that take upon them to know or to take upon yourself that which i am sure you do not know or jump the after inquiry on your own peril
and how you shall speed in your journey’s end i think you’ll never return to tell one
i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them
what an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness
i am sure hanging’s the way of winking
knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the king
thou bring’st good news i am call’d to be made free
thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the dead
unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets i never saw one so prone
yet on my conscience there are verier knaves desire to live for all he be a roman and there be some of them too that die against their wills so should i if i were one
i would we were all of one mind and one mind good
o there were desolation of gaolers and gallowses
i speak against my present profit but my wish hath a preferment in’t
enter cymbeline belarius guiderius arviragus pisanio lords officers and attendants
stand by my side you whom the gods have made preservers of my throne
woe is my heart that the poor soldier that so richly fought whose rags sham’d gilded arms whose naked breast stepp’d before targes of proof cannot be found
he shall be happy that can find him if our grace can make him so
i never saw such noble fury in so poor a thing such precious deeds in one that promis’d nought but beggary and poor looks
he hath been search’d among the dead and living but no trace of him
to my grief i am the heir of his reward to belarius guiderius and arviragus which i will add to you the liver heart and brain of britain by whom i grant she lives
’tis now the time to ask of whence you are
sir in cambria are we born and gentlemen further to boast were neither true nor modest unless i add we are honest
arise my knights o’ th’ battle i create you companions to our person and will fit you with dignities becoming your estates
why so sadly greet you our victory
you look like romans and not o’ th’ court of britain
to sour your happiness i must report the queen is dead
who worse than a physician would this report become
but i consider by med’cine life may be prolong’d yet death will seize the doctor too
with horror madly dying like her life which being cruel to the world concluded most cruel to herself
what she confess’d i will report so please you these her women can trip me if i err who with wet cheeks were present when she finish’d
first she confess’d she never lov’d you only affected greatness got by you not you married your royalty was wife to your place abhorr’d your person
she alone knew this and but she spoke it dying i would not believe her lips in opening it
your daughter whom she bore in hand to love with such integrity she did confess was as a scorpion to her sight whose life but that her flight prevented it she had ta’en off by poison
who is’t can read a woman
she did confess she had for you a mortal mineral which being took should by the minute feed on life and ling’ring by inches waste you
in which time she purpos’d by watching weeping tendance kissing to o’ercome you with her show and in time when she had fitted you with her craft to work her son into th’ adoption of the crown but failing of her end by his strange absence grew shameless desperate open’d in despite of heaven and men her purposes repented the evils she hatch’d were not effected so despairing died
heard you all this her women
we did so please your highness
mine eyes were not in fault for she was beautiful mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart that thought her like her seeming
it had been vicious to have mistrusted her yet o my daughter
that it was folly in me thou mayst say and prove it in thy feeling
enter lucius iachimo the soothsayer and other roman prisoners guarded posthumus behind and imogen
thou com’st not caius now for tribute that the britons have raz’d out though with the loss of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit that their good souls may be appeas’d with slaughter of you their captives which ourself have granted so think of your estate
consider sir the chance of war
the day was yours by accident had it gone with us we should not when the blood was cool have threaten’d our prisoners with the sword
but since the gods will have it thus that nothing but our lives may be call’d ransom let it come
sufficeth a roman with a roman’s heart can suffer
augustus lives to think on’t and so much for my peculiar care
this one thing only i will entreat my boy a briton born let him be ransom’d
never master had a page so kind so duteous diligent so tender over his occasions true so feat so nurse like let his virtue join with my request which i’ll make bold your highness cannot deny he hath done no briton harm though he have serv’d a roman
save him sir and spare no blood beside
i have surely seen him his favour is familiar to me
boy thou hast look’d thyself into my grace and art mine own
i know not why wherefore to say “live boy ” ne’er thank thy master
live and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt fitting my bounty and thy state i’ll give it yea though thou do demand a prisoner the noblest ta’en
i do not bid thee beg my life good lad and yet i know thou wilt
alack there’s other work in hand
i see a thing bitter to me as death your life good master must shuffle for itself
the boy disdains me he leaves me scorns me
briefly die their joys that place them on the truth of girls and boys
i love thee more and more think more and more what’s best to ask
he is a roman no more kin to me than i to your highness who being born your vassal am something nearer
i’ll tell you sir in private if you please to give me hearing
ay with all my heart and lend my best attention
thou’rt my good youth my page i’ll be thy master
cymbeline and imogen converse apart belarius
is not this boy reviv’d from death
one sand another not more resembles that sweet rosy lad who died and was fidele
creatures may be alike were’t he i am sure he would have spoke to us
since she is living let the time run on to good or bad
come stand thou by our side make thy demand aloud
to iachimo sir step you forth give answer to this boy and do it freely or by our greatness and the grace of it which is our honour bitter torture shall winnow the truth from falsehood
my boon is that this gentleman may render of whom he had this ring
that diamond upon your finger say how came it yours
thou’lt torture me to leave unspoken that which to be spoke would torture thee
i am glad to be constrain’d to utter that which torments me to conceal
by villainy i got this ring ’twas leonatus’ jewel whom thou didst banish and—which more may grieve thee as it doth me—a nobler sir ne’er liv’d ’twixt sky and ground
wilt thou hear more my lord
that paragon thy daughter for whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits quail to remember—give me leave i faint
renew thy strength i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will than die ere i hear more
upon a time unhappy was the clock that struck the hour was in rome accurs’d the mansion where ’twas at a feast o would our viands had been poison’d or at least those which i heav’d to head the good posthumus what should i say
he was too good to be where ill men were and was the best of all amongst the rar’st of good ones sitting sadly hearing us praise our loves of italy for beauty that made barren the swell’d boast of him that best could speak for feature laming the shrine of venus or straight pight minerva postures beyond brief nature for condition a shop of all the qualities that man loves woman for besides that hook of wiving fairness which strikes the eye
all too soon i shall unless thou wouldst grieve quickly
this posthumus most like a noble lord in love and one that had a royal lover took his hint and not dispraising whom we prais’d therein he was as calm as virtue he began his mistress’ picture which by his tongue being made and then a mind put in’t either our brags were crack’d of kitchen trulls or his description prov’d us unspeaking sots
your daughter’s chastity there it begins he spake of her as dian had hot dreams and she alone were cold whereat i wretch made scruple of his praise and wager’d with him pieces of gold ’gainst this which then he wore upon his honour’d finger to attain in suit the place of’s bed and win this ring by hers and mine adultery
he true knight no lesser of her honour confident than i did truly find her stakes this ring and would so had it been a carbuncle of phoebus’ wheel and might so safely had it been all the worth of’s car
away to britain post i in this design
well may you sir remember me at court where i was taught of your chaste daughter the wide difference ’twixt amorous and villainous
being thus quench’d of hope not longing mine italian brain gan in your duller britain operate most vilely for my vantage excellent and to be brief my practice so prevail’d that i return’d with simular proof enough to make the noble leonatus mad by wounding his belief in her renown with tokens thus and thus averring notes of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet o cunning how i got it
nay some marks of secret on her person that he could not but think her bond of chastity quite crack’d i having ta’en the forfeit
whereupon methinks i see him now— posthumus
coming forward ay so thou dost italian fiend
ay me most credulous fool egregious murderer thief anything that’s due to all the villains past in being to come
o give me cord or knife or poison some upright justicer
thou king send out for torturers ingenious
it is i that all th’ abhorred things o’ th’ earth amend by being worse than they
i am posthumus that kill’d thy daughter villain like i lie that caus’d a lesser villain than myself a sacrilegious thief to do’t
the temple of virtue was she yea and she herself
spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set the dogs o’ th’ street to bay me
every villain be call’d posthumus leonatus and be villainy less than ’twas
my queen my life my wife
shall’s have a play of this
thou scornful page there lies thy part
you ne’er kill’d imogen till now
how comes these staggers on me
if this be so the gods do mean to strike me to death with mortal joy
o get thee from my sight thou gav’st me poison
lady the gods throw stones of sulphur on me if that box i gave you was not thought by me a precious thing
i had it from the queen
i left out one thing which the queen confess’d which must approve thee honest
‘if pisanio have’ said she ‘given his mistress that confection which i gave him for cordial she is serv’d as i would serve a rat ’ cymbeline
the queen sir very oft importun’d me to temper poisons for her still pretending the satisfaction of her knowledge only in killing creatures vile as cats and dogs of no esteem
i dreading that her purpose was of more danger did compound for her a certain stuff which being ta’en would cease the present pow’r of life but in short time all offices of nature should again do their due functions
most like i did for i was dead
my boys there was our error
why did you throw your wedded lady from you
think that you are upon a rock and now throw me again
hang there like fruit my soul till the tree die
what mak’st thou me a dullard in this act
wilt thou not speak to me
to guiderius and arviragus though you did love this youth i blame ye not you had a motive for’t
my tears that fall prove holy water on thee
i am sorry for’t my lord
o she was naught and long of her it was that we meet here so strangely but her son is gone we know not how nor where
my lord now fear is from me i’ll speak troth
lord cloten upon my lady’s missing came to me with his sword drawn foam’d at the mouth and swore if i discover’d not which way she was gone it was my instant death
by accident i had a feigned letter of my master’s then in my pocket which directed him to seek her on the mountains near to milford where in a frenzy in my master’s garments which he enforc’d from me away he posts with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate my lady’s honour
what became of him i further know not
let me end the story i slew him there
i would not thy good deeds should from my lips pluck a hard sentence
i have spoke it and i did it
the wrongs he did me were nothing prince like for he did provoke me with language that would make me spurn the sea if it could so roar to me
i cut off’s head and am right glad he is not standing here to tell this tale of mine
by thine own tongue thou art condemn’d and must endure our law
that headless man i thought had been my lord
bind the offender and take him from our presence
this man is better than the man he slew as well descended as thyself and hath more of thee merited than a band of clotens had ever scar for
to the guard let his arms alone they were not born for bondage
why old soldier wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for by tasting of our wrath
how of descent as good as we
in that he spake too far
we will die all three but i will prove that two on’s are as good as i have given out him
my sons i must for mine own part unfold a dangerous speech though haply well for you
have at it then by leave
thou hadst great king a subject who was call’d belarius
he it is that hath assum’d this age indeed a banish’d man i know not how a traitor
take him hence the whole world shall not save him
first pay me for the nursing of thy sons and let it be confiscate all so soon as i have receiv’d it
i am too blunt and saucy here’s my knee
ere i arise i will prefer my sons then spare not the old father
mighty sir these two young gentlemen that call me father and think they are my sons are none of mine they are the issue of your loins my liege and blood of your begetting
so sure as you your father’s
i old morgan am that belarius whom you sometime banish’d
your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment itself and all my treason that i suffer’d was all the harm i did
these gentle princes for such and so they are these twenty years have i train’d up those arts they have as i could put into them
my breeding was sir as your highness knows
their nurse euriphile whom for the theft i wedded stole these children upon my banishment i mov’d her to’t having receiv’d the punishment before for that which i did then
beaten for loyalty excited me to treason
their dear loss the more of you ’twas felt the more it shap’d unto my end of stealing them
but gracious sir here are your sons again and i must lose two of the sweet’st companions in the world
the benediction of these covering heavens fall on their heads like dew
for they are worthy to inlay heaven with stars
the service that you three have done is more unlike than this thou tell’st
if these be they i know not how to wish a pair of worthier sons
this gentleman whom i call polydore most worthy prince as yours is true guiderius this gentleman my cadwal arviragus your younger princely son he sir was lapp’d in a most curious mantle wrought by th’ hand of his queen mother which for more probation i can with ease produce
guiderius had upon his neck a mole a sanguine star it was a mark of wonder
this is he who hath upon him still that natural stamp
it was wise nature’s end in the donation to be his evidence now
a mother to the birth of three
blest pray you be that after this strange starting from your orbs you may reign in them now
o imogen thou hast lost by this a kingdom
no my lord i have got two worlds by’t
o my gentle brothers have we thus met
o never say hereafter but i am truest speaker
you call’d me brother when i was but your sister i you brothers when we were so indeed
and at first meeting lov’d continu’d so until we thought he died
by the queen’s dram she swallow’d
when shall i hear all through
this fierce abridgement hath to it circumstantial branches which distinction should be rich in
and when came you to serve our roman captive
why fled you from the court
these and your three motives to the battle with i know not how much more should be demanded and all the other by dependances from chance to chance but nor the time nor place will serve our long interrogatories
see posthumus anchors upon imogen and she like harmless lightning throws her eye on him her brothers me her master hitting each object with a joy the counterchange is severally in all
let’s quit this ground and smoke the temple with our sacrifices
to belarius thou art my brother so we’ll hold thee ever
you are my father too and did relieve me to see this gracious season
all o’erjoy’d save these in bonds
let them be joyful too for they shall taste our comfort
my good master i will yet do you service
the forlorn soldier that so nobly fought he would have well becom’d this place and grac’d the thankings of a king
i am sir the soldier that did company these three in poor beseeming ’twas a fitment for the purpose i then follow’d
that i was he speak iachimo
i had you down and might have made you finish
kneeling i am down again but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee as then your force did
take that life beseech you which i so often owe but your ring first and here the bracelet of the truest princess that ever swore her faith
the pow’r that i have on you is to spare you the malice towards you to forgive you
live and deal with others better
we’ll learn our freeness of a son in law pardon’s the word to all
you holp us sir as you did mean indeed to be our brother joy’d are we that you are
good my lord of rome call forth your soothsayer
as i slept methought great jupiter upon his eagle back’d appear’d to me with other spritely shows of mine own kindred
when i wak’d i found this label on my bosom whose containing is so from sense in hardness that i can make no collection of it
let him show his skill in the construction
reads when as a lion’s whelp shall to himself unknown without seeking find and be embrac’d by a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp’d branches which being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow then shall posthumus end his miseries britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty thou leonatus art the lion’s whelp the fit and apt construction of thy name being leo natus doth import so much
to cymbeline the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter which we call mollis aer and mollis aer we term it mulier which mulier i divine is this most constant wife who even now answering the letter of the oracle unknown to you unsought were clipp’d about with this most tender air
the lofty cedar royal cymbeline personates thee and thy lopp’d branches point thy two sons forth who by belarius stol’n for many years thought dead are now reviv’d to the majestic cedar join’d whose issue promises britain peace and plenty
well my peace we will begin
and caius lucius although the victor we submit to cæsar and to the roman empire promising to pay our wonted tribute from the which we were dissuaded by our wicked queen whom heavens in justice both on her and hers have laid most heavy hand
the fingers of the pow’rs above do tune the harmony of this peace
the vision which i made known to lucius ere the stroke of yet this scarce cold battle at this instant is full accomplish’d for the roman eagle from south to west on wing soaring aloft lessen’d herself and in the beams o’ th’ sun so vanish’d which foreshow’d our princely eagle th’ imperial cæsar cæsar should again unite his favour with the radiant cymbeline which shines here in the west
laud we the gods and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils from our bless’d altars
publish we this peace to all our subjects
set we forward let a roman and a british ensign wave friendly together
so through lud’s town march and in the temple of great jupiter our peace we’ll ratify seal it with feasts
never was a war did cease ere bloody hands were wash’d with such a peace

scene v a more remote part of the castle
dramatis personæ hamlet prince of denmark
claudius king of denmark hamlet’s uncle
the ghost of the late king hamlet’s father
gertrude the queen hamlet’s mother now wife of claudius
lords ladies officers soldiers sailors messengers and attendants
enter francisco and barnardo two sentinels
you come most carefully upon your hour
’tis bitter cold and i am sick at heart
if you do meet horatio and marcellus the rivals of my watch bid them make haste
o farewell honest soldier who hath reliev’d you
what has this thing appear’d again tonight
horatio says ’tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it
sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we two nights have seen
well sit we down and let us hear barnardo speak of this
last night of all when yond same star that’s westward from the pole had made his course t’illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one— marcellus
in the same figure like the king that’s dead
thou art a scholar speak to it horatio
looks it not like the king
it harrows me with fear and wonder
barnardo it would be spoke to
what art thou that usurp’st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march
by heaven i charge thee speak
’tis gone and will not answer
is not this something more than fantasy
before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes
is it not like the king
as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he th’ambitious norway combated so frown’d he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state
good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week
what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is’t that can inform me
that can i at least the whisper goes so
now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in’t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost
and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land
i think it be no other but e’en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars
a mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye
in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune’s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen
i’ll cross it though it blast me
if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me
if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me
if thou art privy to thy country’s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it
the cock crows stop it marcellus
shall i strike at it with my partisan
do if it will not stand
we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery
it was about to speak when the cock crew
and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons
i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th’extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine
and of the truth herein this present object made probation
it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever ’gainst that season comes wherein our saviour’s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow’d and so gracious is the time
so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill
break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty
let’s do’t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently
a room of state in the castle
enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant
though yet of hamlet our dear brother’s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves
therefore our sometime sister now our queen th’imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as ’twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr’d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along
now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother’s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail’d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother
now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew’s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow
farewell and let your haste commend your duty
in that and all things will we show our duty
we doubt it nothing heartily farewell
exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what’s the news with you
you told us of some suit
you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice
what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking
the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father
dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal’d my hard consent
i do beseech you give him leave to go
take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will
but now my cousin hamlet and my son— hamlet
aside a little more than kin and less than kind
how is it that the clouds still hang on you
not so my lord i am too much i’ the sun
good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust
thou know’st ’tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity
if it be why seems it so particular with thee
nay it is i know not seems
’tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly
these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe
’tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow
but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness
’tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool’d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart
fie ’tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today ‘this must be so ’ we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you
for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg
i shall in all my best obey you madam
why ’tis a loving and a fair reply
madam come this gentle and unforc’d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder
o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew
or that the everlasting had not fix’d his canon ’gainst self slaughter
how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world
’tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely
that it should come to this
but two months dead—nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly
why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month— let me not think on’t—frailty thy name is woman
a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father’s body like niobe all tears —why she even she— o god
a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn’d longer —married with mine uncle my father’s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married
o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
it is not nor it cannot come to good
but break my heart for i must hold my tongue
i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself
the same my lord and your poor servant ever
sir my good friend i’ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio — marcellus
i am very glad to see you —good even sir — but what in faith make you from wittenberg
a truant disposition good my lord
i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself
i know you are no truant
but what is your affair in elsinore
we’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
my lord i came to see your father’s funeral
i prithee do not mock me fellow student
i think it was to see my mother’s wedding
indeed my lord it follow’d hard upon
the funeral bak’d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio
my father —methinks i see my father
i saw him once he was a goodly king
he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
my lord i think i saw him yesternight
my lord the king your father
season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you
for god’s love let me hear
two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter’d
a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap à pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk’d by their oppress’d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon’s length whilst they distill’d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him
this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver’d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes
i knew your father these hands are not more like
my lord upon the platform where we watch
did you not speak to it
my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak
but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish’d from our sight
as i do live my honour’d lord ’tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it
indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
my lord from head to foot
then saw you not his face
o yes my lord he wore his beaver up
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger
and fix’d his eyes upon you
i would i had been there
it would have much amaz’d you
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver’d
i will watch tonight perchance ’twill walk again
if it assume my noble father’s person i’ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace
i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal’d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue
upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve i’ll visit you
your loves as mine to you farewell
exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father’s spirit in arms
all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come
till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o’erwhelm them to men’s eyes
and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you
for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more
for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal
perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh’d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu’d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head
then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster’d importunity
fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire
the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon
virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos’d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent
be wary then best safety lies in fear
youth to itself rebels though none else near
i shall th’effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart
but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff’d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede
a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay’d for
laying his hand on laertes’s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character
give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion’d thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch’d unfledg’d comrade
beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear’t that th’opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express’d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that
neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man
farewell my blessing season this in thee
most humbly do i take my leave my lord
the time invites you go your servants tend
farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you
’tis in my memory lock’d and you yourself shall keep the key of it
what is’t ophelia he hath said to you
so please you something touching the lord hamlet
marry well bethought ’tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous
if it be so —as so ’tis put on me and that in way of caution —i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour
he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me
you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his tenders as you call them
i do not know my lord what i should think
marry i’ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta’en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling
tender yourself more dearly or —not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus —you’ll tender me a fool
my lord he hath importun’d me with love in honourable fashion
ay fashion you may call it go to go to
and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven
i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire
from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley
for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you
in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile
i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
look to’t i charge you come your ways
the air bites shrewdly it is very cold
it is a nipping and an eager air
i think it lacks of twelve
it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord
the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge
ay marry is’t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour’d in the breach than the observance
this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform’d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute
the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal
angels and ministers of grace defend us
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com’st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee
i’ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane
let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz’d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again
what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone
look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground
but do not go with it
it will not speak then will i follow it
why what should be the fear
i do not set my life at a pin’s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself
what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o’er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness
the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath
you shall not go my lord
be rul’d you shall not go
my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion’s nerve
ghost beckons still am i call’d
breaking free from them by heaven i’ll make a ghost of him that lets me
i say away —go on i’ll follow thee
let’s follow ’tis not fit thus to obey him
to what issue will this come
something is rotten in the state of denmark
exeunt scene v a more remote part of the castle
my hour is almost come when i to sulph’rous and tormenting flames must render up myself
pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold
speak i am bound to hear
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
i am thy father’s spirit doom’d for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confin’d to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purg’d away
but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood
if thou didst ever thy dear father love— hamlet
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural
haste me to know’t that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge
i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this
’tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abus’d but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy father’s life now wears his crown
ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts — o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce —won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen
o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine
but virtue as it never will be mov’d though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link’d will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage
methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be
sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood
so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark’d about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body
thus was i sleeping by a brother’s hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatch’d cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhous’led disappointed unanel’d no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head
if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest
but howsoever thou pursu’st this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her
the glow worm shows the matin to be near and ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire
o all you host of heaven
hold my heart and you my sinews grow not instant old but bear me stiffly up
ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe
yea from the table of my memory i’ll wipe away all trivial fond records all saws of books all forms all pressures past that youth and observation copied there and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain unmix’d with baser matter
o villain villain smiling damned villain
meet it is i set it down that one may smile and smile and be a villain
at least i am sure it may be so in denmark
writing so uncle there you are
now to my word it is ‘adieu adieu remember me ’ i have sworn’t
within illo ho ho my lord
not i my lord by heaven
how say you then would heart of man once think it — but you’ll be secret
there’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he’s an arrant knave
there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave to tell us this
why right you are i’ the right and so without more circumstance at all i hold it fit that we shake hands and part you as your business and desires shall point you — for every man hath business and desire such as it is —and for my own poor part look you i’ll go pray
these are but wild and whirling words my lord
i’m sorry they offend you heartily yes faith heartily
yes by saint patrick but there is horatio and much offence too
touching this vision here it is an honest ghost that let me tell you
for your desire to know what is between us o’ermaster’t as you may
and now good friends as you are friends scholars and soldiers give me one poor request
never make known what you have seen tonight
in faith my lord not i marcellus
nor i my lord in faith
we have sworn my lord already
ha ha boy say’st thou so
come on you hear this fellow in the cellarage
never to speak of this that you have seen
hic et ubique then we’ll shift our ground
come hither gentlemen and lay your hands again upon my sword
never to speak of this that you have heard
canst work i’ th’earth so fast
o day and night but this is wondrous strange
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome
there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
but come here as before never so help you mercy how strange or odd soe’er i bear myself — as i perchance hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on— that you at such times seeing me never shall with arms encumber’d thus or this head shake or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase as ‘well we know’ or ‘we could and if we would’ or ‘if we list to speak’ or ‘there be and if they might’ or such ambiguous giving out to note that you know aught of me —this not to do
so grace and mercy at your most need help you swear
so gentlemen with all my love i do commend me to you and what so poor a man as hamlet is may do t’express his love and friending to you god willing shall not lack
let us go in together and still your fingers on your lips i pray
the time is out of joint
o cursed spite that ever i was born to set it right
give him this money and these notes reynaldo
you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behaviour
my lord i did intend it
marry well said very well said
look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it
take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him as thus ‘i know his father and his friends and in part him’—do you mark this reynaldo
‘and in part him but ’ you may say ‘not well but if’t be he i mean he’s very wild addicted so and so ’ and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty
ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing
my lord that would dishonour him
faith no as you may season it in the charge
you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that’s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault
ay my lord i would know that
marry sir here’s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant
you laying these slight sullies on my son as ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ th’ working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur’d he closes with you in this consequence ‘good sir ’ or so or ‘friend ’ or ‘gentleman’— according to the phrase or the addition of man and country
and then sir does he this — he does—what was i about to say
by the mass i was about to say something
at ‘closes in the consequence ’ at ‘friend or so ’ and ‘gentleman ’ polonius
at ‘closes in the consequence’ ay marry
he closes with you thus ‘i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t’other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o’ertook in’s rouse there falling out at tennis’ or perchance ‘i saw him enter such a house of sale’— videlicet a brothel or so forth
see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out
so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son
you have me have you not
god b’ wi’ you fare you well
and let him ply his music
how now ophelia what’s the matter
alas my lord i have been so affrighted
with what in the name of god
my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac’d no hat upon his head his stockings foul’d ungart’red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me
my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it
he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o’er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it
long stay’d he so at last —a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being
that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn’d he seem’d to find his way without his eyes for out o’ doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me
i will go seek the king
this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures
i am sorry — what have you given him any hard words of late
no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him
i fear’d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee
it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion
come go we to the king
this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love
enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants
moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending
something have you heard of hamlet’s transformation so i call it since nor th’exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was
what it should be more than his father’s death that thus hath put him so much from th’understanding of himself i cannot dream of
i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour’d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open’d lies within our remedy
good gentlemen he hath much talk’d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres
if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king’s remembrance
both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty
we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son
go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him
exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some attendants enter polonius
th’ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully return’d
thou still hast been the father of good news
assure you my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think —or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath us’d to do—that i have found the very cause of hamlet’s lunacy
o speak of that that do i long to hear
give first admittance to th’ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast
thyself do grace to them and bring them in
exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son’s distemper
i doubt it is no other but the main his father’s death and our o’erhasty marriage
enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius
say voltemand what from our brother norway
most fair return of greetings and desires
upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew’s levies which to him appear’d to be a preparation ’gainst the polack but better look’d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev’d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th’assay of arms against your majesty
whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down
it likes us well and at our more consider’d time we’ll read answer and think upon this business
meantime we thank you for your well took labour
go to your rest at night we’ll feast together
my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time
were nothing but to waste night day and time
therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief
mad call i it for to define true madness what is’t but to be nothing else but mad
madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad ’tis true ’tis true ’tis pity and pity ’tis ’tis true
a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art
mad let us grant him then
and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause
thus it remains and the remainder thus
perpend i have a daughter—have whilst she is mine— who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this
reads to the celestial and my soul’s idol the most beautified ophelia — that’s an ill phrase a vile phrase ‘beautified’ is a vile phrase but you shall hear
reads these in her excellent white bosom these c queen
came this from hamlet to her
good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
reads doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love
o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers
i have not art to reckon my groans
but that i love thee best o most best believe it
thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show’d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear
but how hath she receiv’d his love
what do you think of me
as of a man faithful and honourable
but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv’d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play’d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look’d upon this love with idle sight what might you think
no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak ‘lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star
this must not be ’ and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens
which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed —a short tale to make— fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for
hath there been such a time i’d fain know that that i have positively said ‘’tis so ’ when it prov’d otherwise
take this from this if this be otherwise
points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre
how may we try it further
you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby
at such a time i’ll loose my daughter to him
be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter
if he love her not and be not from his reason fall’n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
away i do beseech you both away i’ll board him presently
exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet
do you know me my lord
then i would you were so honest a man
ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion — have you a daughter
let her not walk i’ th’ sun
conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
aside still harping on my daughter
yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger
he is far gone far gone
and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this
i’ll speak to him again —what do you read my lord
what is the matter my lord
i mean the matter that you read my lord
for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams
all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down
for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward
aside though this be madness yet there is a method in’t — will you walk out of the air my lord
indeed that is out o’ the air
aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are
a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of
i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter
my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you
you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life
you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is
to polonius god save you sir
good lads how do ye both
as the indifferent children of the earth
happy in that we are not over happy on fortune’s cap we are not the very button
nor the soles of her shoe
then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours
in the secret parts of fortune
o most true she is a strumpet
none my lord but that the world’s grown honest
but your news is not true
let me question more in particular
what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither
a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o’ th’ worst
we think not so my lord
why then ’tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
to me it is a prison
why then your ambition makes it one ’tis too narrow for your mind
o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
a dream itself is but a shadow
truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow
then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch’d heroes the beggars’ shadows
for by my fay i cannot reason
i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended
but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore
to visit you my lord no other occasion
beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you
and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny
what should we say my lord
you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
i know the good king and queen have sent for you
but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no
aside nay then i have an eye of you
if you love me hold not off
my lord we were sent for
i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather
i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o’erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
what a piece of work is man
how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable
in action how like an angel
in apprehension how like a god
the beauty of the world the paragon of animals
and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust
man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
why did you laugh then when i said ‘man delights not me’
to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you
we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
he that plays the king shall be welcome —his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’ sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for’t
even those you were wont to take such delight in—the tragedians of the city
their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city
nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for’t
these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing
will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession
faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy
there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question
o there has been much throwing about of brains
do the boys carry it away
ay that they do my lord
it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
’sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out
gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore
the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony
let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours
but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived
i am but mad north north west
when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw
hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer
that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts
happily he’s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child
i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
mark it —you say right sir for a monday morning ’twas so indeed
my lord i have news to tell you
my lord i have news to tell you
when roscius was an actor in rome— polonius
the actors are come hither my lord
then came each actor on his ass— polonius
the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral comical historical pastoral tragical historical tragical comical historical pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited
seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty
o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou
what treasure had he my lord
why— ’one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well ’ polonius
am i not i’ th’ right old jephthah
if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well
why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was
the first row of the pious chanson will show you more
for look where my abridgement comes
you are welcome masters welcome all
i am glad to see thee well
thy face is valanc’d since i saw thee last
com’st thou to beard me in denmark
what my young lady and mistress
by’r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine
pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring
we’ll e’en to’t like french falconers fly at anything we see
come give us a taste of your quality
i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million ’twas caviare to the general
but it was—as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning
i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine
one speech in it i chiefly loved
’twas aeneas’ tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam’s slaughter
if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th’ hyrcanian beast — it is not so it begins with pyrrhus— the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d with heraldry more dismal
head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick’d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak’d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders
roasted in wrath and fire and thus o’ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you
’fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion
anon he finds him striking too short at greeks
his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command
unequal match’d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th’unnerved father falls
then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus’ ear
for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem’d i’ th’air to stick
so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing
but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus’ pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops’ hammers fall on mars’s armour forg’d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus’ bleeding sword now falls on priam
all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends polonius
it shall to the barber’s with your beard —prythee say on
he’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps
but who o who had seen the mobled queen — hamlet
run barefoot up and down threat’ning the flames with bisson rheum
a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all o’erteemed loins a blanket in th’alarm of fear caught up— who this had seen with tongue in venom steep’d ’gainst fortune’s state would treason have pronounc’d
but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made — unless things mortal move them not at all — would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods polonius
look where he has not turn’d his colour and has tears in’s eyes
i’ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon —good my lord will you see the players well bestowed
do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time
after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live
my lord i will use them according to their desert
use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping
use them after your own honour and dignity
the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend
can you play the murder of gonzago
you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in’t could you not
follow that lord and look you mock him not
exit first player to rosencrantz and guildenstern my good friends i’ll leave you till night
ay so god b’ wi’ ye
o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan’d tears in his eyes distraction in’s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit
what’s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her
what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have
he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears
yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing
no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn’d defeat was made
who calls me villain breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i’ th’ throat as deep as to the lungs
’swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon liver’d and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave’s offal
why what an ass am i
this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murder’d prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion
i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim’d their malefactions
for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ
i’ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle
i’ll observe his looks i’ll tent him to the quick
if he but blench i know my course
the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t’assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me
i’ll have grounds more relative than this
the play’s the thing wherein i’ll catch the conscience of the king
enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern
and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy
he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak
nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state
but with much forcing of his disposition
niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply
did you assay him to any pastime
madam it so fell out that certain players we o’er raught on the way
of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it
they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him
’tis most true and he beseech’d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter
with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin’d
good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights
sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as ’twere by accident may here affront ophelia
her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav’d if’t be th’affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for
and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet’s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours
ophelia walk you here —gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves — to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness —we are oft to blame in this ’tis too much prov’d that with devotion’s visage and pious action we do sugar o’er the devil himself
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
the harlot’s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word
exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet
to be or not to be that is the question whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them
to die—to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to ’tis a consummation devoutly to be wish’d
to sleep perchance to dream—ay there’s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause
there’s the respect that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor’s wrong the proud man’s contumely the pangs of dispriz’d love the law’s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin
who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover’d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action
soft you now the fair ophelia
nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember’d
good my lord how does your honour for this many a day
i humbly thank you well well well
my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver
i pray you now receive them
no not i i never gave you aught
my honour’d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos’d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty
could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness
this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof
indeed my lord you made me believe so
you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it
why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners
i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me
i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in
what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven
we are arrant knaves all believe none of us
go thy ways to a nunnery
let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own house
o help him you sweet heavens
if thou dost marry i’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry
be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny
get thee to a nunnery go farewell
or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them
to a nunnery go and quickly too
i have heard of your paintings too well enough
god hath given you one face and you make yourselves another
you jig you amble and you lisp and nickname god’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance
go to i’ll no more on’t it hath made me mad
i say we will have no more marriages
those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are
o what a noble mind is here o’erthrown
the courtier’s soldier’s scholar’s eye tongue sword th’expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form th’observ’d of all observers quite quite down
and i of ladies most deject and wretched that suck’d the honey of his music vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatch’d form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy
o woe is me t’have seen what i have seen see what i see
his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lack’d form a little was not like madness
there’s something in his soul o’er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself
but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love
you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all
my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i’ll be plac’d so please you in the ear of all their conference
if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think
madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go
speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue
but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines
nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness
o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise
i would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing termagant
be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor
suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure
now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others
o there be players that i have seen play—and heard others praise and that highly—not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably
i hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us sir
and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered
that’s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it
exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern
will the king hear this piece of work
and the queen too and that presently
exit polonius will you two help to hasten them
here sweet lord at your service
horatio thou art e’en as just a man as e’er my conversation cop’d withal
nay do not think i flatter for what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits to feed and clothe thee
why should the poor be flatter’d
no let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish her election hath seal’d thee for herself
for thou hast been as one in suffering all that suffers nothing a man that fortune’s buffets and rewards hast ta’en with equal thanks
and bles’d are those whose blood and judgment are so well co mingled that they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger to sound what stop she please
give me that man that is not passion’s slave and i will wear him in my heart’s core ay in my heart of heart as i do thee
there is a play tonight before the king
one scene of it comes near the circumstance which i have told thee of my father’s death
i prythee when thou see’st that act a foot even with the very comment of thy soul observe mine uncle
if his occulted guilt do not itself unkennel in one speech it is a damned ghost that we have seen and my imaginations are as foul as vulcan’s stithy
give him heedful note for i mine eyes will rivet to his face and after we will both our judgments join in censure of his seeming
if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and scape detecting i will pay the theft
they are coming to the play
enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz guildenstern and others
excellent i’ faith of the chameleon’s dish i eat the air promise crammed you cannot feed capons so
i have nothing with this answer hamlet these words are not mine
to polonius my lord you play’d once i’ th’university you say
that did i my lord and was accounted a good actor
i was kill’d i’ th’ capitol
it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there
ay my lord they stay upon your patience
come hither my dear hamlet sit by me
no good mother here’s metal more attractive
lady shall i lie in your lap
lying down at ophelia’s feet ophelia
i mean my head upon your lap
do you think i meant country matters
that’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs
o god your only jig maker
what should a man do but be merry
for look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within’s two hours
nay ’tis twice two months my lord
nay then let the devil wear black for i’ll have a suit of sables
die two months ago and not forgotten yet
then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year
but by’r lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is ‘for o for o the hobby horse is forgot ’ trumpets sound
enter a king and a queen very lovingly the queen embracing him and he her
she kneels and makes show of protestation unto him
he takes her up and declines his head upon her neck
lays him down upon a bank of flowers
she seeing him asleep leaves him
anon comes in a fellow takes off his crown kisses it pours poison in the king’s ears and exits
the queen returns finds the king dead and makes passionate action
the poisoner with some three or four mutes comes in again seeming to lament with her
the dead body is carried away
the poisoner woos the queen with gifts
she seems loth and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts his love exeunt ophelia
marry this is miching mallicho it means mischief
belike this show imports the argument of the play
we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they’ll tell all
will they tell us what this show meant
ay or any show that you’ll show him
be not you ashamed to show he’ll not shame to tell you what it means
you are naught you are naught i’ll mark the play
for us and for our tragedy here stooping to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently hamlet
is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
enter a king and a queen
full thirty times hath phoebus’ cart gone round neptune’s salt wash and tellus’ orbed ground and thirty dozen moons with borrow’d sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been since love our hearts and hymen did our hands unite commutual in most sacred bands
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o’er ere love be done
but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust you
yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must for women’s fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity
now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is siz’d my fear is so
where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there
faith i must leave thee love and shortly too my operant powers their functions leave to do and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honour’d belov’d and haply one as kind for husband shalt thou— player queen
such love must needs be treason in my breast
in second husband let me be accurst
none wed the second but who kill’d the first
the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love
a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed
i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break
purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be
most necessary ’tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose
the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy
where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
this world is not for aye nor ’tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for ’tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanc’d makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
so think thou wilt no second husband wed but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
nor earth to me give food nor heaven light sport and repose lock from me day and night to desperation turn my trust and hope an anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope each opposite that blanks the face of joy meet what i would have well and it destroy
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife if once a widow ever i be wife
to ophelia if she should break it now
my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile the tedious day with sleep
sleep rock thy brain and never come mischance between us twain
madam how like you this play
the lady protests too much methinks
o but she’ll keep her word
no no they do but jest poison in jest no offence i’ th’ world
what do you call the play
this play is the image of a murder done in vienna
gonzago is the duke’s name his wife baptista you shall see anon ’tis a knavish piece of work but what o’ that
your majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not
let the gall’d jade wince our withers are unwrung
this is one lucianus nephew to the king
you are a good chorus my lord
i could interpret between you and your love if i could see the puppets dallying
you are keen my lord you are keen
it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
so you mistake your husbands —begin murderer
pox leave thy damnable faces and begin
come the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge
thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing confederate season else no creature seeing thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected with hecate’s ban thrice blasted thrice infected thy natural magic and dire property on wholesome life usurp immediately
pours the poison into the sleeper’s ears hamlet
he poisons him i’ th’garden for’s estate
the story is extant and written in very choice italian
you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of gonzago’s wife
exeunt all but hamlet and horatio hamlet
why let the strucken deer go weep the hart ungalled play for some must watch while some must sleep so runs the world away
would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn turk with me with two provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir
for thou dost know o damon dear this realm dismantled was of jove himself and now reigns here a very very—pajock
o good horatio i’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound
upon the talk of the poisoning
i did very well note him
for if the king like not the comedy why then belike he likes it not perdie
good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
is in his retirement marvellous distempered
no my lord rather with choler
your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler
good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair
the queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you
nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed
if it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer i will do your mother’s commandment if not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business
but sir such answer as i can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother
therefore no more but to the matter
my mother you say — rosencrantz
then thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration
o wonderful son that can so stonish a mother
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed
we shall obey were she ten times our mother
have you any further trade with us
my lord you once did love me
and so i do still by these pickers and stealers
good my lord what is your cause of distemper
you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend
how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark
ay sir but while the grass grows—the proverb is something musty
re enter the players with recorders
let me see one —to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil
o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly
i do not well understand that
will you play upon this pipe
i know no touch of it my lord
’tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with your finger and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
look you these are the stops
but these cannot i command to any utterance of harmony
why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me
you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak
’sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe
call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me
my lord the queen would speak with you and presently
do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel
by the mass and ’tis like a camel indeed
methinks it is like a weasel
it is backed like a weasel
then will i come to my mother by and by —they fool me to the top of my bent —i will come by and by
by and by is easily said
exeunt all but hamlet ’tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out contagion to this world
now could i drink hot blood and do such bitter business as the day would quake to look on
o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel not unnatural
i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
how in my words somever she be shent to give them seals never my soul consent
i like him not nor stands it safe with us to let his madness range
therefore prepare you i your commission will forthwith dispatch and he to england shall along with you
the terms of our estate may not endure hazard so near us as doth hourly grow out of his lunacies
most holy and religious fear it is to keep those many many bodies safe that live and feed upon your majesty
the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from ’noyance but much more that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest the lives of many
the cease of majesty dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw what’s near it with it
it is a massy wheel fix’d on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortis’d and adjoin’d which when it falls each small annexment petty consequence attends the boist’rous ruin
never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan
arm you i pray you to this speedy voyage for we will fetters put upon this fear which now goes too free footed
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern enter polonius
my lord he’s going to his mother’s closet
behind the arras i’ll convey myself to hear the process
i’ll warrant she’ll tax him home and as you said and wisely was it said ’tis meet that some more audience than a mother since nature makes them partial should o’erhear the speech of vantage
fare you well my liege i’ll call upon you ere you go to bed and tell you what i know
exit polonius o my offence is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon’t — a brother’s murder
pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brother’s blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow
whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence
and what’s in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardon’d being down
but o what form of prayer can serve my turn
that cannot be since i am still possess’d of those effects for which i did the murder — my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardon’d and retain th’offence
in the corrupted currents of this world offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice and oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law
but ’tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compell’d even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence
yet what can it when one cannot repent
o limed soul that struggling to be free art more engag’d
make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the new born babe
now might i do it pat now he is praying
and so he goes to heaven and so am i reveng’d
that would be scann’d a villain kills my father and for that i his sole son do this same villain send to heaven
o this is hire and salary not revenge
he took my father grossly full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may and how his audit stands who knows save heaven
but in our circumstance and course of thought ’tis heavy with him
and am i then reveng’d to take him in the purging of his soul when he is fit and season’d for his passage
up sword and know thou a more horrid hent when he is drunk asleep or in his rage or in th’incestuous pleasure of his bed at gaming swearing or about some act that has no relish of salvation in’t then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven and that his soul may be as damn’d and black as hell whereto it goes
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days
exit the king rises and advances
my words fly up my thoughts remain below
words without thoughts never to heaven go
look you lay home to him tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with and that your grace hath screen’d and stood between much heat and him
pray you be round with him
i’ll warrant you fear me not
polonius goes behind the arras enter hamlet
hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
mother you have my father much offended
come come you answer with an idle tongue
go go you question with a wicked tongue
no by the rood not so
you are the queen your husband’s brother’s wife and would it were not so
nay then i’ll set those to you that can speak
come come and sit you down you shall not budge
you go not till i set you up a glass where you may see the inmost part of you
draws dead for a ducat dead
makes a pass through the arras polonius
o me what hast thou done
o what a rash and bloody deed is this
almost as bad good mother as kill a king and marry with his brother
ay lady ’twas my word — to polonius thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
i took thee for thy better
take thy fortune thou find’st to be too busy is some danger — leave wringing of your hands
peace sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damned custom have not braz’d it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense
what have i done that thou dar’st wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me
such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there
makes marriage vows as false as dicers’ oaths
o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words
heaven’s face doth glow yea this solidity and compound mass with tristful visage as against the doom is thought sick at the act
ay me what act that roars so loud and thunders in the index
look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion’s curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heaven kissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man
here is your husband like a mildew’d ear blasting his wholesome brother
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor
you cannot call it love for at your age the hey day in the blood is tame it’s humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this
sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplex’d for madness would not err nor sense to ecstacy was ne’er so thrall’d but it reserv’d some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference
what devil was’t that thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman blind
eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope
rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire
proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will
thou turn’st mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct
nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed stew’d in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty
o speak to me no more these words like daggers enter in mine ears no more sweet hamlet
a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord
a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket
a king of shreds and patches — enter ghost
save me and hover o’er me with your wings you heavenly guards
do you not come your tardy son to chide that laps’d in time and passion lets go by the important acting of your dread command
this visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
but look amazement on thy mother sits
o step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
how is it with you lady
alas how is’t with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm your bedded hairs like life in excrements start up and stand an end
o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience
look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoin’d preaching to stones would make them capable —do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects
then what i have to do will want true colour tears perchance for blood
to whom do you speak this
nothing at all yet all that is i see
my father in his habit as he liv’d
look where he goes even now out at the portal
this is the very coinage of your brain
this bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time and makes as healthful music
it is not madness that i have utter’d
bring me to the test and i the matter will re word which madness would gambol from
mother for love of grace lay not that flattering unction to your soul that not your trespass but my madness speaks
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place whilst rank corruption mining all within infects unseen
confess yourself to heaven repent what’s past avoid what is to come and do not spread the compost on the weeds to make them ranker
forgive me this my virtue for in the fatness of these pursy times virtue itself of vice must pardon beg yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
o throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half
but go not to mine uncle’s bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
that monster custom who all sense doth eat of habits evil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on
refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence
the next more easy for use almost can change the stamp of nature and either curb the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency
once more good night and when you are desirous to be bles’d i’ll blessing beg of you
for this same lord pointing to polonius i do repent but heaven hath pleas’d it so to punish me with this and this with me that i must be their scourge and minister
i will bestow him and will answer well the death i gave him
i must be cruel only to be kind thus bad begins and worse remains behind
not this by no means that i bid you do let the bloat king tempt you again to bed pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse and let him for a pair of reechy kisses or paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers make you to ravel all this matter out that i essentially am not in madness but mad in craft
’twere good you let him know for who that’s but a queen fair sober wise would from a paddock from a bat a gib such dear concernings hide
no in despite of sense and secrecy unpeg the basket on the house’s top let the birds fly and like the famous ape to try conclusions in the basket creep and break your own neck down
be thou assur’d if words be made of breath and breath of life i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me
i must to england you know that
there’s letters seal’d and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fang’d — they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery
let it work for ’tis the sport to have the enginer hoist with his own petard and ’t shall go hard but i will delve one yard below their mines and blow them at the moon
o ’tis most sweet when in one line two crafts directly meet
this man shall set me packing
i’ll lug the guts into the neighbour room
indeed this counsellor is now most still most secret and most grave who was in life a foolish peating knave
come sir to draw toward an end with you
exit hamlet dragging out polonius act iv scene i
enter king queen rosencrantz and guildenstern
these profound heaves you must translate
bestow this place on us a little while
to rosencrantz and guildenstern who go out ah my good lord what have i seen tonight
mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the mightier
in his lawless fit behind the arras hearing something stir whips out his rapier cries ‘a rat a rat ’ and in this brainish apprehension kills the unseen good old man
it had been so with us had we been there
his liberty is full of threats to all to you yourself to us to everyone
alas how shall this bloody deed be answer’d
it will be laid to us whose providence should have kept short restrain’d and out of haunt this mad young man
but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit but like the owner of a foul disease to keep it from divulging let it feed even on the pith of life
to draw apart the body he hath kill’d o’er whom his very madness like some ore among a mineral of metals base shows itself pure
he weeps for what is done
the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch but we will ship him hence and this vile deed we must with all our majesty and skill both countenance and excuse —ho guildenstern
friends both go join you with some further aid hamlet in madness hath polonius slain and from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him
go seek him out speak fair and bring the body into the chapel
i pray you haste in this
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern come gertrude we’ll call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do and what’s untimely done so haply slander whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter as level as the cannon to his blank transports his poison’d shot may miss our name and hit the woundless air
my soul is full of discord and dismay
what have you done my lord with the dead body
compounded it with dust whereto ’tis kin
tell us where ’tis that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel
that i can keep your counsel and not mine own
besides to be demanded of a sponge—what replication should be made by the son of a king
take you me for a sponge my lord
ay sir that soaks up the king’s countenance his rewards his authorities
but such officers do the king best service in the end he keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to be last swallowed when he needs what you have gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again
i understand you not my lord
a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear
my lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king
the body is with the king but the king is not with the body
the king is a thing— guildenstern
i have sent to seek him and to find the body
how dangerous is it that this man goes loose
yet must not we put the strong law on him he’s lov’d of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where ’tis so th’offender’s scourge is weigh’d but never the offence
to bear all smooth and even this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause
diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are reliev’d or not at all
where the dead body is bestow’d my lord we cannot get from him
without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
not where he eats but where he is eaten
a certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him
your worm is your only emperor for diet
we fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots
your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service —two dishes but to one table
a man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
what dost thou mean by this
nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar
if your messenger find him not there seek him i’ th’other place yourself
but indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby
to some attendants go seek him there
he will stay till you come
hamlet this deed for thine especial safety — which we do tender as we dearly grieve for that which thou hast done —must send thee hence with fiery quickness
therefore prepare thyself the bark is ready and the wind at help th’associates tend and everything is bent for england
so is it if thou knew’st our purposes
i see a cherub that sees them
father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother
tempt him with speed aboard delay it not i’ll have him hence tonight
away for everything is seal’d and done that else leans on th’affair
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern and england if my love thou hold’st at aught — as my great power thereof may give thee sense since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red after the danish sword and thy free awe pays homage to us —thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign process which imports at full by letters conjuring to that effect the present death of hamlet
do it england for like the hectic in my blood he rages and thou must cure me
till i know ’tis done howe’er my haps my joys were ne’er begun
go captain from me greet the danish king
tell him that by his license fortinbras craves the conveyance of a promis’d march over his kingdom
if that his majesty would aught with us we shall express our duty in his eye and let him know so
exeunt all but the captain enter hamlet rosencrantz guildenstern c hamlet
good sir whose powers are these
how purpos’d sir i pray you
the nephew to old norway fortinbras
goes it against the main of poland sir or for some frontier
truly to speak and with no addition we go to gain a little patch of ground that hath in it no profit but the name
to pay five ducats five i would not farm it nor will it yield to norway or the pole a ranker rate should it be sold in fee
why then the polack never will defend it
two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw
this is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace that inward breaks and shows no cause without why the man dies
will’t please you go my lord
exeunt all but hamlet how all occasions do inform against me and spur my dull revenge
what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed
sure he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unus’d
now whether it be bestial oblivion or some craven scruple of thinking too precisely on th’event — a thought which quarter’d hath but one part wisdom and ever three parts coward —i do not know why yet i live to say this thing’s to do sith i have cause and will and strength and means to do’t
examples gross as earth exhort me witness this army of such mass and charge led by a delicate and tender prince whose spirit with divine ambition puff’d makes mouths at the invisible event exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell
rightly to be great is not to stir without great argument but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour’s at the stake
how stand i then that have a father kill’d a mother stain’d excitements of my reason and my blood and let all sleep while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain
o from this time forth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
enter queen horatio and a gentleman
i will not speak with her
her mood will needs be pitied
she speaks much of her father says she hears there’s tricks i’ th’ world and hems and beats her heart spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt that carry but half sense
her speech is nothing yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection they aim at it and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them indeed would make one think there might be thought though nothing sure yet much unhappily
’twere good she were spoken with for she may strew dangerous conjectures in ill breeding minds
exit gentleman to my sick soul as sin’s true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt
where is the beauteous majesty of denmark
sings how should i your true love know from another one
by his cockle bat and staff and his sandal shoon
alas sweet lady what imports this song
sings he is dead and gone lady he is dead and gone at his head a grass green turf at his heels a stone
sings white his shroud as the mountain snow
sings larded all with sweet flowers which bewept to the grave did go with true love showers
they say the owl was a baker’s daughter
lord we know what we are but know not what we may be
pray you let’s have no words of this but when they ask you what it means say you this sings tomorrow is saint valentine’s day all in the morning betime and i a maid at your window to be your valentine
then up he rose and donn’d his clothes and dupp’d the chamber door let in the maid that out a maid never departed more
indeed la without an oath i’ll make an end on’t
sings by gis and by saint charity alack and fie for shame
young men will do’t if they come to’t by cock they are to blame
quoth she before you tumbled me you promis’d me to wed
so would i ha’ done by yonder sun an thou hadst not come to my bed
how long hath she been thus
i hope all will be well
but i cannot choose but weep to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground
my brother shall know of it
and so i thank you for your good counsel
good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night
follow her close give her good watch i pray you
exit horatio o this is the poison of deep grief it springs all from her father’s death
o gertrude gertrude when sorrows come they come not single spies but in battalions
first her father slain next your son gone and he most violent author of his own just remove the people muddied thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers for good polonius’ death and we have done but greenly in hugger mugger to inter him
poor ophelia divided from herself and her fair judgment without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
last and as much containing as all these her brother is in secret come from france feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds and wants not buzzers to infect his ear with pestilent speeches of his father’s death wherein necessity of matter beggar’d will nothing stick our person to arraign in ear and ear
o my dear gertrude this like to a murdering piece in many places gives me superfluous death
the ocean overpeering of his list eats not the flats with more impetuous haste than young laertes in a riotous head o’erbears your offices
the rabble call him lord and as the world were now but to begin antiquity forgot custom not known the ratifiers and props of every word they cry ‘choose we
laertes shall be king ’ caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds ‘laertes shall be king laertes king ’ queen
how cheerfully on the false trail they cry
o this is counter you false danish dogs
where is this king —sirs stand you all without
i pray you give me leave
they retire without the door laertes
o thou vile king give me my father
that drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot even here between the chaste unsmirched brow of my true mother
what is the cause laertes that thy rebellion looks so giant like — let him go gertrude
there’s such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would acts little of his will —tell me laertes why thou art thus incens’d —let him go gertrude — speak man
conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
to this point i stand that both the worlds i give to negligence let come what comes only i’ll be reveng’d most throughly for my father
my will not all the world
and for my means i’ll husband them so well they shall go far with little
good laertes if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father’s death is’t writ in your revenge that sweepstake you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser
to his good friends thus wide i’ll ope my arms and like the kind life rendering pelican repast them with my blood
why now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman
that i am guiltless of your father’s death and am most sensibly in grief for it it shall as level to your judgment ’pear as day does to your eye
re enter ophelia fantastically dressed with straws and flowers
o heat dry up my brains
tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
by heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight till our scale turn the beam
dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia
o heavens is’t possible a young maid’s wits should be as mortal as an old man’s life
nature is fine in love and where ’tis fine it sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves
sings they bore him barefac’d on the bier hey no nonny nonny hey nonny and on his grave rain’d many a tear — fare you well my dove
hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge it could not move thus
you must sing ‘down a down and you call him a down a ’ o how the wheel becomes it
it is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter
there’s rosemary that’s for remembrance pray love remember
and there is pansies that’s for thoughts
a document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
there’s fennel for you and columbines
there’s rue for you and here’s some for me
we may call it herb of grace o’ sundays
o you must wear your rue with a difference
i would give you some violets but they wither’d all when my father died
they say he made a good end
sings for bonny sweet robin is all my joy
thought and affliction passion hell itself she turns to favour and to prettiness
sings and will he not come again
and will he not come again
no no he is dead go to thy death bed he never will come again
his beard was as white as snow all flaxen was his poll
he is gone he is gone and we cast away moan
god ha’ mercy on his soul
and of all christian souls i pray god
do you see this o god
laertes i must commune with your grief or you deny me right
go but apart make choice of whom your wisest friends you will and they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me
if by direct or by collateral hand they find us touch’d we will our kingdom give our crown our life and all that we call ours to you in satisfaction but if not be you content to lend your patience to us and we shall jointly labour with your soul to give it due content
let this be so his means of death his obscure burial — no trophy sword nor hatchment o’er his bones no noble rite nor formal ostentation — cry to be heard as ’twere from heaven to earth that i must call’t in question
and where th’offence is let the great axe fall
i pray you go with me
what are they that would speak with me
they say they have letters for you
exit servant i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet
he shall sir and’t please him
there’s a letter for you sir
it comes from th’ambassador that was bound for england if your name be horatio as i am let to know it is
reads ‘horatio when thou shalt have overlooked this give these fellows some means to the king
ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase
finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple i boarded them
on the instant they got clear of our ship so i alone became their prisoner
they have dealt with me like thieves of mercy
but they knew what they did i am to do a good turn for them
let the king have the letters i have sent and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death
i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter
these good fellows will bring thee where i am
rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for england of them i have much to tell thee
he that thou knowest thine hamlet ’ come i will give you way for these your letters and do’t the speedier that you may direct me to him from whom you brought them
now must your conscience my acquittance seal and you must put me in your heart for friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursu’d my life
but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so crimeful and so capital in nature as by your safety wisdom all things else you mainly were stirr’d up
o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew’d but yet to me they are strong
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself — my virtue or my plague be it either which — she’s so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her
the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again and not where i had aim’d them
and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desperate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections
break not your sleeps for that
you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger and think it pastime
i lov’d your father and we love ourself and that i hope will teach you to imagine— enter a messenger
this to your majesty this to the queen
sailors my lord they say i saw them not
they were given me by claudio
he receiv’d them of him that brought them
exit messenger reads ‘high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom
tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes
when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return
hamlet ’ what should this mean
are all the rest come back
or is it some abuse and no such thing
’naked ’ and in a postscript here he says ‘alone ’ can you advise me
i am lost in it my lord
but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth ‘thus diest thou ’ king
if it be so laertes — as how should it be so
how otherwise — will you be rul’d by me
ay my lord so you will not o’errule me to a peace
if he be now return’d as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident
my lord i will be rul’d the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ
you have been talk’d of since your travel much and that in hamlet’s hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine
your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege
what part is that my lord
a very riband in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness
two months since here was a gentleman of normandy — i’ve seen myself and serv’d against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in’t
he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been incorps’d and demi natur’d with the brave beast
so far he topp’d my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did
he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation
he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence and for your rapier most especially that he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed if one could match you
the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you oppos’d them
sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o’er to play with him
now out of this — laertes
what out of this my lord
laertes was your father dear to you
or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart
not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it
there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much
that we would do we should do when we would for this ‘would’ changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing
but to the quick o’ th’ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your father’s son in deed more than in words
to cut his throat i’ th’ church
no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds
but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber
hamlet return’d shall know you are come home we’ll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads
he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father
and for that purpose i’ll anoint my sword
i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death this is but scratch’d withal
i’ll touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death
let’s further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape
if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance
therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof
we’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings — i ha’t
when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink i’ll have prepar’d him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping if he by chance escape your venom’d stuck our purpose may hold there
one woe doth tread upon another’s heel so fast they follow
there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream
there with fantastic garlands did she make of crow flowers nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them
there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clamb’ring to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook
her clothes spread wide and mermaid like awhile they bore her up which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and indued unto that element
but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death
too much of water hast thou poor ophelia and therefore i forbid my tears
but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds let shame say what it will
when these are gone the woman will be out
adieu my lord i have a speech of fire that fain would blaze but that this folly douts it
let’s follow gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage
now fear i this will give it start again therefore let’s follow
enter two clowns with spades c first clown
is she to be buried in christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation
i tell thee she is and therefore make her grave straight
the crowner hath sat on her and finds it christian burial
how can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defence
it must be se offendendo it cannot be else
for here lies the point if i drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an act hath three branches
it is to act to do and to perform argal she drowned herself wittingly
nay but hear you goodman delver — first clown
if the man go to this water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes —mark you that
but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself
argal he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life
ay marry is’t crowner’s quest law
will you ha’ the truth on’t
if this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o’ christian burial
and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian
there is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners ditchers and grave makers they hold up adam’s profession
he was the first that ever bore arms
how dost thou understand the scripture
i’ll put another question to thee
if thou answerest me not to the purpose confess thyself— second clown
what is he that builds stronger than either the mason the shipwright or the carpenter
the gallows maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants
i like thy wit well in good faith the gallows does well
it does well to those that do ill now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal the gallows may do well to thee
who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a carpenter
ay tell me that and unyoke
enter hamlet and horatio at a distance
cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating and when you are asked this question next say ‘a grave maker’
the houses he makes last till doomsday
go get thee to yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor
exit second clown digs and sings in youth when i did love did love methought it was very sweet to contract o the time for a my behove o methought there was nothing meet
has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave making
custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
’tis e’en so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense
sings but age with his stealing steps hath claw’d me in his clutch and hath shipp’d me into the land as if i had never been such
that skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
how the knave jowls it to th’ ground as if ’twere cain’s jawbone that did the first murder
this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er offices one that would circumvent god might it not
or of a courtier which could say ‘good morrow sweet lord
how dost thou good lord ’ this might be my lord such a one that praised my lord such a one’s horse when he meant to beg it might it not
why e’en so and now my lady worm’s chapless and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade
here’s fine revolution an we had the trick to see’t
did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em
sings a pickaxe and a spade a spade for and a shrouding sheet o a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet
why may not that be the skull of a lawyer
where be his quiddits now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery
this fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries
is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt
will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures
the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
not a jot more my lord
is not parchment made of sheep skins
ay my lord and of calf skins too
they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that
i will speak to this fellow —whose grave’s this sir
sings o a pit of clay for to be made for such a guest is meet
i think it be thine indeed for thou liest in’t
you lie out on’t sir and therefore ’tis not yours
for my part i do not lie in’t yet it is mine
thou dost lie in’t to be in’t and say it is thine
’tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest
’tis a quick lie sir ’t will away again from me to you
what man dost thou dig it for
who is to be buried in’t
one that was a woman sir but rest her soul she’s dead
we must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us
by the lord horatio these three years i have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe —how long hast thou been a grave maker
of all the days i’ th’ year i came to’t that day that our last king hamlet o’ercame fortinbras
it was the very day that young hamlet was born —he that is mad and sent into england
ay marry why was he sent into england
why because he was mad he shall recover his wits there or if he do not it’s no great matter there
’twill not be seen in him there there the men are as mad as he
faith e’en with losing his wits
i have been sexton here man and boy thirty years
how long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot
faith if he be not rotten before he die —as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in —he will last you some eight year or nine year
a tanner will last you nine year
why sir his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while
and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
here’s a skull now this skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty years
a whoreson mad fellow’s it was
whose do you think it was
a pestilence on him for a mad rogue
a pour’d a flagon of rhenish on my head once
this same skull sir was yorick’s skull the king’s jester
takes the skull alas poor yorick
i knew him horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy
he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now how abhorred in my imagination it is
here hung those lips that i have kiss’d i know not how oft
your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar
not one now to mock your own grinning
now get you to my lady’s chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this favour she must come
make her laugh at that —prythee horatio tell me one thing
dost thou think alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth
to what base uses we may return horatio
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bung hole
’twere to consider too curiously to consider so
but to follow him thither with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as thus
alexander died alexander was buried alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer barrel
imperious caesar dead and turn’d to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away
o that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw
enter priests c in procession the corpse of ophelia laertes and mourners following king queen their trains c the queen the courtiers
this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo it own life
that is laertes a very noble youth
her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d as we have warranties
her death was doubtful and but that great command o’ersways the order she should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d till the last trumpet
for charitable prayers shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
yet here she is allowed her virgin rites her maiden strewments and the bringing home of bell and burial
must there no more be done
we should profane the service of the dead to sing sage requiem and such rest to her as to peace parted souls
lay her i’ th’earth and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring
i tell thee churlish priest a minist’ring angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling
scattering flowers sweets to the sweet
i hop’d thou shouldst have been my hamlet’s wife i thought thy bride bed to have deck’d sweet maid and not have strew’d thy grave
o treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense depriv’d thee of
hold off the earth a while till i have caught her once more in mine arms
leaps into the grave now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made to o’ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus
advancing what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis
whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wand’ring stars and makes them stand like wonder wounded hearers
this is i hamlet the dane
grappling with him the devil take thy soul
i prythee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenative and rash yet have i in me something dangerous which let thy wiseness fear
the attendants part them and they come out of the grave hamlet
why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag
i lov’d ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum
what wilt thou do for her
for love of god forbear him
’swounds show me what thou’lt do woul’t weep
dost thou come here to whine
to outface me with leaping in her grave
be buried quick with her and so will i
and if thou prate of mountains let them throw millions of acres on us till our ground singeing his pate against the burning zone make ossa like a wart
nay an thou’lt mouth i’ll rant as well as thou
this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclos’d his silence will sit drooping
hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus
let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day
i pray thee good horatio wait upon him
exit horatio to laertes strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech we’ll put the matter to the present push — good gertrude set some watch over your son
this grave shall have a living monument
an hour of quiet shortly shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be
now let me see the other you do remember all the circumstance
sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep
methought i lay worse than the mutinies in the bilboes
rashly and prais’d be rashness for it —let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us there’s a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will
up from my cabin my sea gown scarf’d about me in the dark grop’d i to find out them had my desire finger’d their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unseal their grand commission where i found horatio oh royal knavery
an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark’s health and england’s too with ho
such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the axe my head should be struck off
here’s the commission read it at more leisure
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed
being thus benetted round with villanies — or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play —i sat me down devis’d a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labour’d much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman’s service
wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote
an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma ’tween their amities and many such like ‘as’es of great charge that on the view and know of these contents without debatement further more or less he should the bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allow’d
why even in that was heaven ordinant
i had my father’s signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of the other subscrib’d it gave’t th’impression plac’d it safely the changeling never known
now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou know’st already
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to’t
why man they did make love to this employment
they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow
’tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites
why what a king is this
does it not thinks’t thee stand me now upon — he that hath kill’d my king and whor’d my mother popp’d in between th’election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm
and is’t not to be damn’d to let this canker of our nature come in further evil
it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there
the interim is mine and a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘one’
but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow’ring passion
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark
thy state is the more gracious for ’tis a vice to know him
he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess ’tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt
sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty
i will receive it with all diligence of spirit
put your bonnet to his right use ’tis for the head
i thank your lordship ’tis very hot
no believe me ’tis very cold the wind is northerly
it is indifferent cold my lord indeed
methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
exceedingly my lord it is very sultry —as ’twere—i cannot tell how
but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head
sir this is the matter — hamlet
i beseech you remember — hamlet moves him to put on his hat osric
nay in good faith for mine ease in good faith
sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing
indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see
sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath
is’t not possible to understand in another tongue
what imports the nomination of this gentleman
his purse is empty already all’s golden words are spent
i know you are not ignorant — hamlet
i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is — hamlet
i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he’s unfellowed
the king sir hath wager’d with him six barbary horses against the which he has imponed as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so
three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit
i knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done
the carriages sir are the hangers
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides
i would it might be hangers till then
six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages that’s the french bet against the danish
why is this all imponed as you call it
the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him he shall not exceed you three hits
he hath laid on twelve for nine
and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
sir i will walk here in the hall
if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me
let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him if i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
shall i re deliver you e’en so
to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
i commend my duty to your lordship
exit osric he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for’s turn
this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
he did comply with his dug before he suck’d it
thus has he —and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on — only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out enter a lord
my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall
he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time
i am constant to my purposes they follow the king’s pleasure
if his fitness speaks mine is ready
now or whensoever provided i be so able as now
the king and queen and all are coming down
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play
you will lose this wager my lord
since he went into france i have been in continual practice
i shall win at the odds
but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart but it is no matter
it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman
if your mind dislike anything obey it
i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit
not a whit we defy augury
there’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow
if it be now ’tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
since no man has aught of what he leaves what is’t to leave betimes
enter king queen laertes lords osric and attendants with foils c king
come hamlet come and take this hand from me
the king puts laertes’s hand into hamlet’s hamlet
i have done you wrong but pardon’t as you are a gentleman
this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punish’d with sore distraction
what i have done that might your nature honour and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
if hamlet from himself be ta’en away and when he’s not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
if’t be so hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d his madness is poor hamlet’s enemy
sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o’er the house and hurt my brother
i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge
but in my terms of honour i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungor’d
but till that time i do receive your offer’d love like love and will not wrong it
i embrace it freely and will this brother’s wager frankly play — give us the foils come on
i’ll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night stick fiery off indeed
give them the foils young osric
cousin hamlet you know the wager
your grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side
i have seen you both but since he is better’d we have therefore odds
these foils have all a length
set me the stoups of wine upon that table
if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet’s better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark’s crown have worn
give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth ‘now the king drinks to hamlet ’ come begin
and you the judges bear a wary eye
a hit a very palpable hit
hamlet this pearl is thine here’s to thy health
trumpets sound and cannon shot off within give him the cup
i’ll play this bout first set it by awhile
a touch a touch i do confess
he’s fat and scant of breath
here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet
i will my lord i pray you pardon me
aside it is the poison’d cup it is too late
i dare not drink yet madam
come let me wipe thy face
my lord i’ll hit him now
aside and yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience
i pray you pass with your best violence
i am afeard you make a wanton of me
laertes wounds hamlet then in scuffling they change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes king
look to the queen there ho
why as a woodcock to my own springe osric
i am justly kill’d with mine own treachery
she swoons to see them bleed
no no the drink the drink
let the door be lock’d treachery
no medicine in the world can do thee good
in thee there is not half an hour of life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenom’d
the foul practice hath turn’d itself on me
lo here i lie never to rise again
the king the king’s to blame
stabs the king osric and lords
here thou incestuous murderous damned dane drink off this potion
it is a poison temper’d by himself
exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet
mine and my father’s death come not upon thee nor thine on me
heaven make thee free of it
you that look pale and tremble at this chance that are but mutes or audience to this act had i but time —as this fell sergeant death is strict in his arrest —o i could tell you — but let it be
horatio i am dead thou liv’st report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied
i am more an antique roman than a dane
as th’art a man give me the cup
let go by heaven i’ll have’t
o good horatio what a wounded name things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story
march afar off and shot within what warlike noise is this
young fortinbras with conquest come from poland to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley
the potent poison quite o’er crows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy th’election lights on fortinbras
so tell him with the occurrents more and less which have solicited
good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
why does the drum come hither
march within enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others
what is it you would see
if aught of woe or wonder cease your search
o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck
the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfill’d that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
where should we have our thanks
not from his mouth had it th’ability of life to thank you
he never gave commandment for their death
but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arriv’d give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world how these things came about
so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fall’n on the inventors’ heads
all this can i truly deliver
let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience
for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
but let this same be presently perform’d even while men’s minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen
let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have prov’d most royally and for his passage the soldiers’ music and the rites of war speak loudly for him
such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss
a dead march exeunt bearing off the bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off the first part of king henry the fourth contents act i scene i london

henry percy surnamed hotspur his son
sir michael a friend to the archbishop of york
lords officers sheriff vintner chamberlain drawers carriers ostler messengers servant travellers and attendants
enter the king lord john of lancaster earl of westmoreland with others
so shaken as we are so wan with care find we a time for frighted peace to pant and breathe short winded accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood no more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual well beseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies
the edge of war like an ill sheathed knife no more shall cut his master
therefore friends as far as to the sepulchre of christ— whose soldier now under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight— forthwith a power of english shall we levy whose arms were molded in their mothers’ womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walked those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed for our advantage on the bitter cross
but this our purpose now is twelve month old and bootless ’tis to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now
then let me hear of you my gentle cousin westmoreland what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience
my liege this haste was hot in question and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news whose worst was that the noble mortimer leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower was by the rude hands of that welshman taken a thousand of his people butchered upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse such beastly shameless transformation by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of
it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land
this matched with other did my gracious lord for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on holy rood day the gallant hotspur there young harry percy and brave archibald that ever valiant and approved scot at holmedon met where they did spend a sad and bloody hour as by discharge of their artillery and shape of likelihood the news was told for he that brought them in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse uncertain of the issue any way
here is a dear and true industrious friend sir walter blunt new lighted from his horse stained with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots two and twenty knights balked in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedon’s plains of prisoners hotspur took mordake earl of fife and eldest son to beaten douglas and the earl of athol of murray angus and menteith
and is not this an honourable spoil a gallant prize
in faith it is a conquest for a prince to boast of
yea there thou mak’st me sad and mak’st me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son a son who is the theme of honour’s tongue amongst a grove the very straightest plant who is sweet fortune’s minion and her pride whilst i by looking on the praise of him see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry
o that it could be proved that some night tripping fairy had exchanged in cradle clothes our children where they lay and called mine percy his plantagenet
then would i have his harry and he mine but let him from my thoughts
what think you coz of this young percy’s pride
the prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised to his own use he keeps and sends me word i shall have none but mordake earl of fife
this is his uncle’s teaching this is worcester malevolent to you in all aspects which makes him prune himself and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity
but i have sent for him to answer this and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem
cousin on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered
enter prince henry and sir john falstaff
now hal what time of day is it lad
thou art so fat witted with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know
what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day
unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame coloured taffeta i see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day
indeed you come near me now hal for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars and not by phœbus he that wand’ring knight so fair
and i prithee sweet wag when thou art king as god save thy grace—majesty i should say for grace thou wilt have none— prince
no by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter
marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty let us be diana’s foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the moon and let men say we be men of good government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea being governed as the sea is by the moon
as for proof now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on monday night and most dissolutely spent on tuesday morning got with swearing “lay by” and spent with crying “bring in” now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows
by the lord thou say’st true lad
and is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench
as the honey of hybla my old lad of the castle
and is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
how now how now mad wag
what in thy quips and thy quiddities
what a plague have i to do with a buff jerkin
why what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern
well thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft
did i ever call for thee to pay thy part
no i’ll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there
yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch and where it would not i have used my credit
yea and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent—but i prithee sweet wag shall there be gallows standing in england when thou art king
and resolution thus fubbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law
do not thou when thou art king hang a thief
by the lord i’ll be a brave judge
thou judgest false already i mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman
well hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court i can tell you
yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe
’sblood i am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear
or an old lion or a lover’s lute
yea or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe
what sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of moor ditch
thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative rascalliest sweet young prince
but hal i prithee trouble me no more with vanity
i would to god thou and i knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought
an old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you sir but i marked him not and yet he talked very wisely but i regarded him not and yet he talked wisely and in the street too
thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and no man regards it
o thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint
thou hast done much harm upon me hal god forgive thee for it
before i knew thee hal i knew nothing and now am i if a man should speak truly little better than one of the wicked
i must give over this life and i will give it over
by the lord an i do not i am a villain
i’ll be damned for never a king’s son in christendom
where shall we take a purse tomorrow jack
zounds where thou wilt lad i’ll make one
an i do not call me villain and baffle me
i see a good amendment of life in thee from praying to purse taking
why hal ’tis my vocation hal ’tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation
poins —now shall we know if gadshill have set a match
o if men were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for him
this is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried “stand ” to a true man
good morrow sweet hal —what says monsieur remorse
what says sir john sack and sugar
jack how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on good friday last for a cup of madeira and a cold capon’s leg
sir john stands to his word the devil shall have his bargain for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs
he will give the devil his due
then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil
else he had been damned for cozening the devil
but my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four o’clock early at gad’s hill there are pilgrims going to canterbury with rich offerings and traders riding to london with fat purses
i have visards for you all you have horses for yourselves
i have bespoke supper tomorrow night in eastcheap
we may do it as secure as sleep
if you will go i will stuff your purses full of crowns
if you will not tarry at home and be hanged
hear ye yedward if i tarry at home and go not i’ll hang you for going
there’s neither honesty manhood nor good fellowship in thee nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand for ten shillings
well then once in my days i’ll be a madcap
well come what will i’ll tarry at home
by the lord i’ll be a traitor then when thou art king
sir john i prithee leave the prince and me alone
i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go
well god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed that the true prince may for recreation sake prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want countenance
farewell you shall find me in eastcheap
now my good sweet honey lord ride with us tomorrow
i have a jest to execute that i cannot manage alone
falstaff bardolph peto and gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid
yourself and i will not be there
and when they have the booty if you and i do not rob them cut this head off from my shoulders
but how shall we part with them in setting forth
why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they shall have no sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them
yea but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses by our habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves
tut our horses they shall not see i’ll tie them in the wood our visards we will change after we leave them and sirrah i have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our noted outward garments
yea but i doubt they will be too hard for us
well for two of them i know them to be as true bred cowards as ever turned back and for the third if he fight longer than he sees reason i’ll forswear arms
the virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he endured and in the reproof of this lives the jest
provide us all things necessary and meet me tomorrow night in eastcheap there i’ll sup
i know you all and will awhile uphold the unyok’d humour of your idleness
yet herein will i imitate the sun who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world that when he please again to be himself being wanted he may be more wonder’d at by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him
if all the year were playing holidays to sport would be as tedious as to work but when they seldom come they wish’d for come and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
so when this loose behaviour i throw off and pay the debt i never promised by how much better than my word i am by so much shall i falsify men’s hopes and like bright metal on a sullen ground my reformation glitt’ring o’er my fault shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off
i’ll so offend to make offence a skill redeeming time when men think least i will
enter king henry northumberland worcester hotspur sir walter blunt and others
my blood hath been too cold and temperate unapt to stir at these indignities and you have found me for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself mighty and to be fear’d than my condition which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul ne’er pays but to the proud
our house my sovereign liege little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly
worcester get thee gone for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o sir your presence is too bold and peremptory and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow
you have good leave to leave us
when we need your use and counsel we shall send for you
exit worcester to northumberland you were about to speak
those prisoners in your highness’ name demanded which harry percy here at holmedon took were as he says not with such strength denied as is deliver’d to your majesty
either envy therefore or misprision is guilty of this fault and not my son
my liege i did deny no prisoners
but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress’d fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap’d show’d like a stubble land at harvest home
he was perfumed like a milliner and ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncet box which ever and anon he gave his nose and took’t away again who therewith angry when it next came there took it in snuff and still he smiled and talk’d
and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by he call’d them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility
with many holiday and lady terms he question’d me amongst the rest demanded my prisoners in your majesty’s behalf
i then all smarting with my wounds being cold out of my grief and my impatience to be so pester’d with a popinjay answer’d neglectingly i know not what he should or he should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark
and telling me the sovereignest thing on earth was parmacety for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpetre should be digg’d out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroy’d so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier
this bald unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty
the circumstance consider’d good my lord whatever harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place at such a time with all the rest retold may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said so he unsay it now
why yet he doth deny his prisoners but with proviso and exception that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his brother in law the foolish mortimer who on my soul hath wilfully betray’d the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician damn’d glendower whose daughter as we hear the earl of march hath lately married
shall our coffers then be emptied to redeem a traitor home
shall we buy treason and indent with fears when they have lost and forfeited themselves
no on the barren mountains let him starve for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer
he never did fall off my sovereign liege but by the chance of war
to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn’s sedgy bank in single opposition hand to hand he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower
three times they breathed and three times did they drink upon agreement of swift severn’s flood who then affrighted with their bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank blood stained with these valiant combatants
never did bare and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds nor never could the noble mortimer receive so many and all willingly
then let not him be slander’d with revolt
thou dost belie him percy thou dost belie him he never did encounter with glendower
i tell thee he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy
but sirrah henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer
send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you —my lord northumberland we license your departure with your son — send us your prisoners or you’ll hear of it
exit king henry blunt and train hotspur
an if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them
i will after straight and tell him so for i will ease my heart albeit i make a hazard of my head
zounds i will speak of him and let my soul want mercy if i do not join with him
yea on his part i’ll empty all these veins and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust but i will lift the down trod mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king as this ingrate and canker’d bolingbroke
to worcester brother the king hath made your nephew mad
who struck this heat up after i was gone
he will forsooth have all my prisoners and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife’s brother then his cheek look’d pale and on my face he turn’d an eye of death trembling even at the name of mortimer
was not he proclaim’d by richard that dead is the next of blood
he was i heard the proclamation
and then it was when the unhappy king— whose wrongs in us god pardon —did set forth upon his irish expedition from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered
and for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of
but soft i pray you did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown
he did myself did hear it
nay then i cannot blame his cousin king that wish’d him on the barren mountains starve
but shall it be that you that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation—shall it be that you a world of curses undergo being the agents or base second means the cords the ladder or the hangman rather
o pardon me that i descend so low to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king
shall it for shame be spoken in these days or fill up chronicles in time to come that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf as both of you god pardon it have done to put down richard that sweet lovely rose and plant this thorn this canker bolingbroke
and shall it in more shame be further spoken that you are fool’d discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent
no yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish’d honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again revenge the jeering and disdain’d contempt of this proud king who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths
and now i will unclasp a secret book and to your quick conceiving discontents i’ll read you matter deep and dangerous as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to o’er walk a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear
if we fall in good night or sink or swim
send danger from the east unto the west so honour cross it from the north to south and let them grapple
o the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare
imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience
by heaven methinks it were an easy leap to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathom line could never touch the ground and pluck up drowned honour by the locks so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival all her dignities
but out upon this half faced fellowship
he apprehends a world of figures here but not the form of what he should attend — good cousin give me audience for a while
those same noble scots that are your prisoners— hotspur
i’ll keep them all by god he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not
i’ll keep them by this hand
you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes those prisoners you shall keep— hotspur
he said he would not ransom mortimer forbade my tongue to speak of mortimer but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i’ll holla “mortimer ” nay i’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but “mortimer” and give it him to keep his anger still in motion
all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same sword and buckler prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance— i would have him poison’d with a pot of ale
i will talk to you when you are better temper’d to attend
why what a wasp stung and impatient fool art thou to break into this woman’s mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
why look you i am whipp’d and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolingbroke
in richard’s time—what do you call the place
’twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept his uncle york where i first bow’d my knee unto this king of smiles this bolingbroke ’sblood when you and he came back from ravenspurgh
why what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me
“look when his infant fortune came to age ” and “gentle harry percy ” and “kind cousin ” o the devil take such cozeners —god forgive me
nay if you have not to it again we will stay your leisure
then once more to your scottish prisoners deliver them up without their ransom straight and make the douglas’ son your only mean for powers in scotland which for divers reasons which i shall send you written be assured will easily be granted — to northumberland you my lord your son in scotland being thus employ’d shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate well beloved the archbishop
true who bears hard his brother’s death at bristol the lord scroop
i speak not this in estimation as what i think might be but what i know is ruminated plotted and set down and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on
upon my life it will do well
before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip
why it cannot choose but be a noble plot and then the power of scotland and of york to join with mortimer ha
in faith it is exceedingly well aim’d
and ’tis no little reason bids us speed to save our heads by raising of a head for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we think ourselves unsatisfied till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love
he does he does we’ll be revenged on him
no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course
when time is ripe which will be suddenly i’ll steal to glendower and lord mortimer where you and douglas and our powers at once as i will fashion it shall happily meet to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms which now we hold at much uncertainty
farewell good brother we shall thrive i trust
o let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport
exeunt act ii scene i rochester
enter a carrier with a lantern in his hand
an it be not four by the day i’ll be hang’d
charles’ wain is over the new chimney and yet our horse not pack’d —what ostler
i prithee tom beat cut’s saddle put a few flocks in the point poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess
peas and beans are as dank here as a dog and that is the next way to give poor jades the bots
this house is turned upside down since robin ostler died
poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose it was the death of him
i think this be the most villainous house in all london road for fleas
i am stung like a tench
by the mass there is ne’er a king christen could be better bit than i have been since the first cock
why they will allow us ne’er a jordan and then we leak in your chimney and your chamber lye breeds fleas like a loach
come away and be hanged come away
i have a gammon of bacon and two razes of ginger to be delivered as far as charing cross
the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved —what ostler
hast thou never an eye in thy head
an ’twere not as good deed as drink to break the pate on thee i am a very villain
i think it be two o’clock
i prithee lend me thy lantern to see my gelding in the stable
i know a trick worth two of that i’faith
i pray thee lend me thine
“lend me thy lantern ” quoth he
marry i’ll see thee hanged first
sirrah carrier what time do you mean to come to london
time enough to go to bed with a candle i warrant thee
come neighbour mugs we’ll call up the gentlemen
they will along with company for they have great charge
that’s even as fair as “at hand quoth the chamberlain ” for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring thou layest the plot how
it holds current that i told you yesternight there’s a franklin in the wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold
i heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper a kind of auditor one that hath abundance of charge too god knows what
they are up already and call for eggs and butter
sirrah if they meet not with saint nicholas’ clerks i’ll give thee this neck
i pray thee keep that for the hangman for i know thou worshippest saint nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may
what talkest thou to me of the hangman
if i hang i’ll make a fat pair of gallows for if i hang old sir john hangs with me and thou knowest he is no starveling
tut there are other troyans that thou dream’st not of the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace that would if matters should be looked into for their own credit sake make all whole
i am joined with no foot land rakers no long staff sixpenny strikers none of these mad mustachio purple hued malt worms but with nobility and tranquillity burgomasters and great oneyers such as can hold in such as will strike sooner than speak and speak sooner than drink and drink sooner than pray and yet zounds i lie for they pray continually to their saint the commonwealth or rather not pray to her but prey on her for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots
will she hold out water in foul way
she will she will justice hath liquored her
we steal as in a castle cock sure we have the receipt of fern seed we walk invisible
nay by my faith i think you are more beholding to the night than to fern seed for your walking invisible
thou shalt have a share in our purchase as i am a true man
nay rather let me have it as you are a false thief
go to homo is a common name to all men
bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable
enter prince henry and poins bardolph and peto at some distance
i have removed falstaff’s horse and he frets like a gummed velvet
coming forward peace ye fat kidneyed rascal
what a brawling dost thou keep
he is walked up to the top of the hill
i am accursed to rob in that thief’s company
the rascal hath removed my horse and tied him i know not where
if i travel but four foot by the square further afoot i shall break my wind
well i doubt not but to die a fair death for all this if i ’scape hanging for killing that rogue
i have forsworn his company hourly any time this two and twenty years and yet i am bewitched with the rogue’s company
if the rascal have not given me medicines to make me love him i’ll be hanged
it could not be else i have drunk medicines
i’ll starve ere i’ll rob a foot further
an ’twere not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and to leave these rogues i am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth
eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me and the stony hearted villains know it well enough
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another
give me my horse you rogues give me my horse and be hanged
coming forward peace you fat guts lie down lay thine ear close to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread of travellers
have you any levers to lift me up again being down
’sblood i’ll not bear my own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin in thy father’s exchequer
what a plague mean ye to colt me thus
thou liest thou art not colted thou art uncolted
i prithee good prince hal help me to my horse good king’s son
hang thyself in thine own heir apparent garters
if i be ta’en i’ll peach for this
an i have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy tunes let a cup of sack be my poison—when a jest is so forward and afoot too
so i do against my will
comes forward with bardolph and peto
case ye case ye on with your visards
there’s money of the king’s coming down the hill ’tis going to the king’s exchequer
you lie ye rogue ’tis going to the king’s tavern
there’s enough to make us all
sirs you four shall front them in the narrow lane
ned poins and i will walk lower if they ’scape from your encounter then they light on us
how many be there of them
zounds will they not rob us
what a coward sir john paunch
indeed i am not john of gaunt your grandfather but yet no coward hal
well we leave that to the proof
sirrah jack thy horse stands behind the hedge
when thou need’st him there thou shalt find him
now cannot i strike him if i should be hanged
aside to poins ned where are our disguises
aside to prince henry here hard by
now my masters happy man be his dole say i
come neighbour the boy shall lead our horses down the hill we’ll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs
strike down with them cut the villains’ throats
ah whoreson caterpillars bacon fed knaves they hate us youth
o we are undone both we and ours for ever
hang ye gorbellied knaves are ye undone
no ye fat chuffs i would your store were here
here they rob them and bind them
exeunt enter prince henry and poins in buckram suits
the thieves have bound the true men
now could thou and i rob the thieves and go merrily to london it would be argument for a week laughter for a month and a good jest for ever
stand close i hear them coming
they retire enter the thieves again
come my masters let us share and then to horse before day
an the prince and poins be not two arrant cowards there’s no equity stirring
there’s no more valour in that poins than in a wild duck
as they are sharing the prince and poins set upon them prince
falstaff after a blow or two and the others run away leaving the booty behind them prince
the thieves are all scatter’d and possess’d with fear so strongly that they dare not meet each other each takes his fellow for an officer
falstaff sweats to death and lards the lean earth as he walks along
were’t not for laughing i should pity him
“but for mine own part my lord i could be well contented to be there in respect of the love i bear your house ” he could be contented why is he not then
in respect of the love he bears our house—he shows in this he loves his own barn better than he loves our house
“the purpose you undertake is dangerous”—why that’s certain
’tis dangerous to take a cold to sleep to drink but i tell you my lord fool out of this nettle danger we pluck this flower safety
“the purpose you undertake is dangerous the friends you have named uncertain the time itself unsorted and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition ” say you so say you so
i say unto you again you are a shallow cowardly hind and you lie
what a lack brain is this
by the lord our plot is a good plot as ever was laid our friends true and constant a good plot good friends and full of expectation an excellent plot very good friends
what a frosty spirited rogue is this
why my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of the action
zounds an i were now by this rascal i could brain him with his lady’s fan
is there not my father my uncle and myself
lord edmund mortimer my lord of york and owen glendower
is there not besides the douglas
have i not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month and are they not some of them set forward already
what a pagan rascal is this an infidel
you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the king and lay open all our proceedings
o i could divide myself and go to buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action
hang him let him tell the king we are prepared
i will set forward tonight — enter lady percy
i must leave you within these two hours
o my good lord why are you thus alone
for what offence have i this fortnight been a banish’d woman from my harry’s bed
tell me sweet lord what is’t that takes from thee thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep
why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth and start so often when thou sit’st alone
why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks and given my treasures and my rights of thee to thick eyed musing and curst melancholy
in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch’d and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed cry “courage
to the field ” and thou hast talk’d of sallies and retires of trenches tents of palisadoes frontiers parapets of basilisks of cannon culverin of prisoners’ ransom and of soldiers slain and all the currents of a heady fight
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war and thus hath so bestirr’d thee in thy sleep that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow like bubbles in a late disturbed stream and in thy face strange motions have appear’d such as we see when men restrain their breath on some great sudden hest
some heavy business hath my lord in hand and i must know it else he loves me not
is gilliams with the packet gone
he is my lord an hour ago
hath butler brought those horses from the sheriff
one horse my lord he brought even now
a roan a crop ear is it not
that roan shall be my throne
well i will back him straight
bid butler lead him forth into the park
what is it carries you away
why my horse my love my horse
a weasel hath not such a deal of spleen as you are toss’d with
in faith i’ll know your business harry that i will
i fear my brother mortimer doth stir about his title and hath sent for you to line his enterprise
so far afoot i shall be weary love
come come you paraquito answer me directly unto this question that i ask
in faith i’ll break thy little finger harry if thou wilt not tell me all things true
love i love thee not i care not for thee kate
this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips
we must have bloody noses and crack’d crowns and pass them current too —gods me my horse — what say’st thou kate
what wouldst thou have with me
well do not then for since you love me not i will not love myself
nay tell me if you speak in jest or no
come wilt thou see me ride
and when i am a horseback i will swear i love thee infinitely
but hark you kate i must not have you henceforth question me whither i go nor reason whereabout
whither i must i must and to conclude this evening must i leave you gentle kate
i know you wise but yet no farther wise than harry percy’s wife constant you are but yet a woman and for secrecy no lady closer for i well believe thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know and so far will i trust thee gentle kate
but hark you kate whither i go thither shall you go too
today will i set forth tomorrow you
a room in the boar’s head tavern
ned prithee come out of that fat room and lend me thy hand to laugh a little
with three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads
i have sounded the very base string of humility
sirrah i am sworn brother to a leash of drawers and can call them all by their christian names as tom dick and francis
they take it already upon their salvation that though i be but prince of wales yet i am the king of courtesy and tell me flatly i am no proud jack like falstaff but a corinthian a lad of mettle a good boy —by the lord so they call me—and when i am king of england i shall command all the good lads in eastcheap
they call drinking deep “dyeing scarlet ” and when you breathe in your watering they cry “hem ” and bid you “play it off ” to conclude i am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that i can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life
i tell thee ned thou hast lost much honour that thou wert not with me in this action but sweet ned—to sweeten which name of ned i give thee this pennyworth of sugar clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker one that never spake other english in his life than “eight shillings and sixpence ” and “you are welcome ” with this shrill addition “anon anon sir
score a pint of bastard in the half moon ” or so
but ned to drive away the time till falstaff come i prithee do thou stand in some by room while i question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar and do thou never leave calling “francis ” that his tale to me may be nothing but “anon ” step aside and i’ll show thee a precedent
anon anon sir —look down into the pomegarnet ralph
how long hast thou to serve francis
forsooth five years and as much as to— poins
by’r lady a long lease for the clinking of pewter
but francis darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and run from it
o lord sir i’ll be sworn upon all the books in england i could find in my heart— poins
let me see about michaelmas next i shall be— poins
anon sir —pray stay a little my lord
nay but hark you francis for the sugar thou gavest me ’twas a pennyworth was’t not
o lord i would it had been two
i will give thee for it a thousand pound
ask me when thou wilt and thou shalt have it
no francis but tomorrow francis or francis a thursday or indeed francis when thou wilt
wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin crystal button not pated agate ring puke stocking caddis garter smooth tongue spanish pouch— francis
o lord sir who do you mean
why then your brown bastard is your only drink for look you francis your white canvas doublet will sully
in barbary sir it cannot come to so much
dost thou not hear them call
here they both call him the drawer stands amazed not knowing which way to go enter vintner
what stand’st thou still and hear’st such a calling
exit francis my lord old sir john with half a dozen more are at the door
let them alone awhile and then open the door
sirrah falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door shall we be merry
as merry as crickets my lad
but hark ye what cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer
i am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the old days of goodman adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o’clock at midnight
that ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot and yet the son of a woman
his industry is upstairs and downstairs his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning
i am not yet of percy’s mind the hotspur of the north he that kills me some six or seven dozen of scots at a breakfast washes his hands and says to his wife “fie upon this quiet life
i want work ” “o my sweet harry ” says she “how many hast thou killed today ” “give my roan horse a drench ” says he and answers “some fourteen ” an hour after “a trifle a trifle ” i prithee call in falstaff
i’ll play percy and that damned brawn shall play dame mortimer his wife
call in ribs call in tallow
enter falstaff gadshill bardolph and peto followed by francis with wine
a plague of all cowards i say and a vengeance too
give me a cup of sack boy
ere i lead this life long i’ll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot them too
give me a cup of sack rogue
didst thou never see titan kiss a dish of butter pitiful hearted titan
that melted at the sweet tale of the sun’s
if thou didst then behold that compound
you rogue here’s lime in this sack too there is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it
die when thou wilt if manhood good manhood be not forgot upon the face of the earth then am i a shotten herring
there lives not three good men unhanged in england and one of them is fat and grows old god help the while a bad world i say
i would i were a weaver i could sing psalms or anything
a plague of all cowards i say still
how now wool sack what mutter you
if i do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese i’ll never wear hair on my face more
why you whoreson round man what’s the matter
answer me to that—and poins there
zounds ye fat paunch an ye call me coward by the lord i’ll stab thee
i’ll see thee damned ere i call thee coward but i would give a thousand pound i could run as fast as thou canst
you are straight enough in the shoulders you care not who sees your back
call you that backing of your friends
give me them that will face me —give me a cup of sack
i am a rogue if i drunk today
thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunk’st last
a plague of all cowards still say i
there be four of us here have ta’en a thousand pound this day morning
where is it jack where is it
taken from us it is a hundred upon poor four of us
i am a rogue if i were not at half sword with a dozen of them two hours together
i am eight times thrust through the doublet four through the hose my buckler cut through and through my sword hacked like a handsaw
ecce signum i never dealt better since i was a man all would not do
if they speak more or less than truth they are villains and the sons of darkness
we four set upon some dozen
no no they were not bound
you rogue they were bound every man of them or i am a jew else an ebrew jew
as we were sharing some six or seven fresh men set upon us
and unbound the rest and then come in the other
what fought you with them all
i know not what you call all but if i fought not with fifty of them i am a bunch of radish
if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old jack then am i no two legged creature
pray god you have not murdered some of them
i have peppered two of them
two i am sure i have paid two rogues in buckram suits
i tell thee what hal if i tell thee a lie spit in my face call me horse
here i lay and thus i bore my point
four rogues in buckram let drive at me
thou saidst but two even now
four hal i told thee four
these four came all afront and mainly thrust at me
i made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target thus
why there were but four even now
seven by these hilts or i am a villain else
aside to poins prithee let him alone we shall have more anon
ay and mark thee too jack
do so for it is worth the listening to
these nine in buckram that i told thee of— prince
began to give me ground but i followed me close came in foot and hand and with a thought seven of the eleven i paid
eleven buckram men grown out of two
but as the devil would have it three misbegotten knaves in kendal green came at my back and let drive at me for it was so dark hal that thou couldst not see thy hand
these lies are like the father that begets them gross as a mountain open palpable
why thou clay brained guts thou knotty pated fool thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow catch— falstaff
is not the truth the truth
why how couldst thou know these men in kendal green when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand
come your reason jack your reason
zounds an i were at the strappado or all the racks in the world i would not tell you on compulsion
give you a reason on compulsion
if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries i would give no man a reason upon compulsion i
i’ll be no longer guilty of this sin
this sanguine coward this bed presser this horse back breaker this huge hill of flesh— falstaff
’sblood you starveling you eel skin you dried neat’s tongue you bull’s pizzle you stock fish—o for breath to utter what is like thee
you tailor’s yard you sheath you bow case you vile standing tuck— prince
well breathe awhile and then to it again and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons hear me speak but this
we two saw you four set on four and bound them and were masters of their wealth
mark now how a plain tale shall put you down
then did we two set on you four and with a word outfaced you from your prize and have it yea and can show it you here in the house
and falstaff you carried your guts away as nimbly with as quick dexterity and roared for mercy and still ran and roared as ever i heard bull calf
what a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou hast done and then say it was in fight
what trick what device what starting hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame
come let’s hear jack what trick hast thou now
by the lord i knew ye as well as he that made ye
why hear you my masters was it for me to kill the heir apparent
should i turn upon the true prince
why thou knowest i am as valiant as hercules but beware instinct
the lion will not touch the true prince
i was now a coward on instinct
i shall think the better of myself and thee during my life—i for a valiant lion and thou for a true prince
but by the lord lads i am glad you have the money —hostess clap to the doors
gallants lads boys hearts of gold all the titles of good fellowship come to you
shall we have a play extempore
content and the argument shall be thy running away
ah no more of that hal an thou lovest me
o jesu my lord the prince— prince
how now my lady the hostess
marry my lord there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you he says he comes from your father
give him as much as will make him a royal man and send him back again to my mother
what manner of man is he
what doth gravity out of his bed at midnight
shall i give him his answer
faith and i’ll send him packing
now sirs by’r lady you fought fair so did you peto
you are lions too you ran away upon instinct you will not touch the true prince no fie
faith i ran when i saw others run
faith tell me now in earnest how came falstaff’s sword so hacked
why he hacked it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of england but he would make you believe it was done in fight and persuaded us to do the like
yea and to tickle our noses with spear grass to make them bleed and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men
i did that i did not this seven year before i blushed to hear his monstrous devices
o villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago and wert taken with the manner and ever since thou hast blushed extempore
thou hadst fire and sword on thy side and yet thou ran’st away
what instinct hadst thou for it
my lord do you see these meteors
choler my lord if rightly taken
here comes lean jack here comes bare bone
how now my sweet creature of bombast
how long is’t ago jack since thou sawest thine own knee
when i was about thy years hal i was not an eagle’s talon in the waist
i could have crept into any alderman’s thumb ring a plague of sighing and grief
it blows a man up like a bladder
there’s villanous news abroad here was sir john bracy from your father you must to the court in the morning
that same mad fellow of the north percy and he of wales that gave amamon the bastinado and made lucifer cuckold and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a welsh hook—what a plague call you him
owen owen the same and his son in law mortimer and old northumberland and that sprightly scot of scots douglas that runs a horseback up a hill perpendicular— prince
he that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying
so did he never the sparrow
well that rascal hath good metal in him he will not run
why what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for running
a horseback ye cuckoo but afoot he will not budge a foot
well he is there too and one mordake and a thousand blue caps more
worcester is stolen away tonight thy father’s beard is turned white with the news
you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel
why then it is like if there come a hot june and this civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hobnails by the hundreds
by the mass lad thou sayest true
it is like we shall have good trading that way
but tell me hal art not thou horrible afeard
thou being heir apparent could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend douglas that spirit percy and that devil glendower
doth not thy blood thrill at it
i lack some of thy instinct
well thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father
if thou love me practise an answer
do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life
this chair shall be my state this dagger my sceptre and this cushion my crown
thy state is taken for a joint stool thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown
well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee now shalt thou be moved
give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red that it may be thought i have wept for i must speak in passion and i will do it in king cambyses’ vein
o jesu this is excellent sport i faith
weep not sweet queen for trickling tears are vain
o the father how he holds his countenance
for god’s sake lords convey my tristful queen for tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes
o jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever i see
peace good pint pot peace good tickle brain —harry i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou art accompanied
for though the camomile the more it is trodden on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the sooner it wears
that thou art my son i have partly thy mother’s word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me
if then thou be son to me here lies the point why being son to me art thou so pointed at
shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries
a question not to be asked
shall the son of england prove a thief and take purses
there is a thing harry which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch
this pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile so doth the company thou keepest
for harry now i do not speak to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion not in words only but in woes also
and yet there is a virtuous man whom i have often noted in thy company but i know not his name
what manner of man an it like your majesty
a goodly portly man i’faith and a corpulent of a cheerful look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as i think his age some fifty or by’r lady inclining to threescore and now i remember me his name is falstaff
if that man should be lewdly given he deceiveth me for harry i see virtue in his looks
if then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit by the tree then peremptorily i speak it there is virtue in that falstaff him keep with the rest banish
and tell me now thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month
dost thou speak like a king
do thou stand for me and i’ll play my father
if thou dost it half so gravely so majestically both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a rabbit sucker or a poulter’s hare
the complaints i hear of thee are grievous
’sblood my lord they are false —nay i’ll tickle ye for a young prince i’faith
thou art violently carried away from grace
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man
a tun of man is thy companion
why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours that bolting hutch of beastliness that swollen parcel of dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuffed cloak bag of guts that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that vanity in years
wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink it
wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it
wherein villainous but in all things
i would your grace would take me with you
that villainous abominable misleader of youth falstaff that old white bearded satan
my lord the man i know
but to say i know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than i know
that he is old the more the pity his white hairs do witness it
but that he is saving your reverence a whoremaster that i utterly deny
if sack and sugar be a fault god help the wicked
if to be old and merry be a sin then many an old host that i know is damned
if to be fat be to be hated then pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved
no my good lord banish peto banish bardolph banish poins but for sweet jack falstaff kind jack falstaff true jack falstaff valiant jack falstaff and therefore more valiant being as he is old jack falstaff banish not him thy harry’s company banish not him thy harry’s company
banish plump jack and banish all the world
a knocking heard exeunt hostess francis and bardolph enter bardolph running
o my lord my lord the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door
i have much to say in the behalf of that falstaff
o jesu my lord my lord— prince
heigh heigh the devil rides upon a fiddlestick
the sheriff and all the watch are at the door
they are come to search the house
never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit thou art essentially made without seeming so
and thou a natural coward without instinct
if you will deny the sheriff so if not let him enter
if i become not a cart as well as another man a plague on my bringing up
i hope i shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another
go hide thee behind the arras
now my masters for a true face and good conscience
both which i have had but their date is out and therefore i’ll hide me
exeunt all but the prince and peto enter sheriff and the carrier
now master sheriff what is your will with me
a hue and cry hath followed certain men unto this house
one of them is well known my gracious lord a gross fat man
the man i do assure you is not here for i myself at this time have employ’d him
and sheriff i will engage my word to thee that i will by tomorrow dinner time send him to answer thee or any man for anything he shall be charged withal
and so let me entreat you leave the house
there are two gentlemen have in this robbery lost three hundred marks
if he have robb’d these men he shall be answerable and so farewell
i think it is good morrow is it not
indeed my lord i think it be two o’clock
exit sheriff with the carrier prince
this oily rascal is known as well as paul’s
falstaff —fast asleep behind the arras and snorting like a horse
hark how hard he fetches breath
he searcheth his pocket and findeth certain papers what hast thou found
item anchovies and sack after supper 2s
but one halfpennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack
what there is else keep close
we’ll read it at more advantage
there let him sleep till day
i’ll to the court in the morning
we must all to the wars and thy place shall be honourable
i’ll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot and i know his death will be a march of twelve score
the money shall be paid back again with advantage
be with me betimes in the morning and so good morrow peto
exeunt act iii scene i bangor
a room in the archdeacon’s house
enter hotspur worcester mortimer and glendower
these promises are fair the parties sure and our induction full of prosperous hope
lord mortimer and cousin glendower will you sit down
and uncle worcester a plague upon it
sit cousin percy sit good cousin hotspur for by that name as oft as lancaster doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
and you in hell as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of
at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes of burning cressets and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward
why so it would have done at the same season if your mother’s cat had but kitten’d though yourself had never been born
i say the earth did shake when i was born
and i say the earth was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook
the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
o then th’ earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and moss grown towers
at your birth our grandam earth having this distemp’rature in passion shook
cousin of many men i do not bear these crossings
give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes the goats ran from the mountains and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
these signs have mark’d me extraordinary and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men
where is he living clipp’d in with the sea that chides the banks of england scotland wales which calls me pupil or hath read to me
and bring him out that is but woman’s son can trace me in the tedious ways of art and hold me pace in deep experiments
i think there is no man speaks better welsh
peace cousin percy you will make him mad
i can call spirits from the vasty deep
why so can i or so can any man but will they come when you do call for them
why i can teach you cousin to command the devil
and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil
if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and i’ll be sworn i have power to shame him hence
o while you live tell truth and shame the devil
come come no more of this unprofitable chat
three times hath henry bolingbroke made head against my power thrice from the banks of wye and sandy bottom’d severn have i sent him bootless home and weather beaten back
home without boots and in foul weather too
how ’scapes he agues in the devil’s name
come here’s the map shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ta’en
the archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally england from trent and severn hitherto by south and east is to my part assign’d all westward wales beyond the severn shore and all the fertile land within that bound to owen glendower and dear coz to you the remnant northward lying off from trent
and our indentures tripartite are drawn which being sealed interchangeably a business that this night may execute tomorrow cousin percy you and i and my good lord of worcester will set forth to meet your father and the scottish power as is appointed us at shrewsbury
my father glendower is not ready yet nor shall we need his help these fourteen days
to glendower within that space you may have drawn together your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
a shorter time shall send me to you lords and in my conduct shall your ladies come from whom you now must steal and take no leave for there will be a world of water shed upon the parting of your wives and you
methinks my moiety north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours
see how this river comes me cranking in and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge half moon a monstrous cantle out
i’ll have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly
it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here
yea but mark how he bears his course and runs me up with like advantage on the other side gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side it takes from you
yea but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land and then he runs straight and even
i’ll have it so a little charge will do it
let me not understand you then speak it in welsh
i can speak english lord as well as you for i was train’d up in the english court where being but young i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue a helpful ornament— a virtue that was never seen in you
marry and i am glad of it with all my heart
i had rather be a kitten and cry “mew” than one of these same metre ballad mongers i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn’d or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would set my teeth nothing on edge nothing so much as mincing poetry
’tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag
come you shall have trent turn’d
i’ll give thrice so much land to any well deserving friend but in the way of bargain mark ye me i’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
the moon shines fair you may away by night
i’ll haste the writer and withal break with your wives of your departure hence
i am afraid my daughter will run mad so much she doteth on her mortimer
fie cousin percy how you cross my father
sometimes he angers me with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a clip wing’d griffin and a moulten raven a couching lion and a ramping cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith
i tell you what— he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils’ names that were his lackeys i cried “hum ” and “well go to ” but mark’d him not a word
o he is as tedious as a tired horse a railing wife worse than a smoky house
i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill far than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom
in faith he is a worthy gentleman exceedingly well read and profited in strange concealments valiant as a lion and wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india
he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come cross his humour faith he does
i warrant you that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft let me entreat you
in faith my lord you are too wilful blame and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite besides his patience
you must needs learn lord to amend this fault
though sometimes it show greatness courage blood— and that’s the dearest grace it renders you— yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage defect of manners want of government pride haughtiness opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides beguiling them of commendation
here come our wives and let us take our leave
enter glendower with lady mortimer and lady percy
this is the deadly spite that angers me my wife can speak no english i no welsh
my daughter weeps she’ll not part with you she’ll be a soldier too she’ll to the wars
good father tell her that she and my aunt percy shall follow in your conduct speedily
glendower speaks to lady mortimer in welsh and she answers him in the same glendower
she is desperate here a peevish self willed harlotry one that no persuasion can do good upon
lady mortimer speaks to mortimer in welsh mortimer
i understand thy looks that pretty welsh which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens i am too perfect in and but for shame in such a parley should i answer thee
lady mortimer speaks to him again in welsh i understand thy kisses and thou mine and that’s a feeling disputation but i will never be a truant love till i have learnt thy language for thy tongue makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn’d sung by a fair queen in a summer’s bower with ravishing division to her lute
nay if you melt then will she run mad
lady mortimer speaks to mortimer again in welsh mortimer
o i am ignorance itself in this
she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap and she will sing the song that pleaseth you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep charming your blood with pleasing heaviness making such difference ’twixt wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the heavenly harness’d team begins his golden progress in the east
with all my heart i’ll sit and hear her sing by that time will our book i think be drawn
do so and those musicians that shall play to you hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence and straight they shall be here sit and attend
come kate thou art perfect in lying down
come quick quick that i may lay my head in thy lap
now i perceive the devil understands welsh and ’tis no marvel he’s so humorous
by’r lady he’s a good musician
then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours
lie still ye thief and hear the lady sing in welsh
i had rather hear lady my brach howl in irish
wouldst thou have thy head broken
here the lady sings a welsh song come kate i’ll have your song too
you swear like a comfit maker’s wife
“not you in good sooth ” and “as true as i live ” and “as god shall mend me ” and “as sure as day” and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou never walk’dst further than finsbury
swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouth filling oath and leave “in sooth ” and such protest of pepper gingerbread to velvet guards and sunday citizens
’tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast teacher
an the indentures be drawn i’ll away within these two hours and so come in when ye will
come come lord mortimer you are as slow as hot lord percy is on fire to go
by this our book is drawn
we’ll but seal and then to horse immediately
enter king henry prince henry and lords
lords give us leave the prince of wales and i must have some private conference but be near at hand for we shall presently have need of you
exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark’d for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings
tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts such barren pleasures rude society as thou art match’d withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart
so please your majesty i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal
yet such extenuation let me beg as in reproof of many tales devised by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear i may for some things true wherein my youth hath faulty wander’d and irregular find pardon on my true submission
yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood
the hope and expectation of thy time is ruin’d and the soul of every man prophetically do forethink thy fall
had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackney’d in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
by being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wonder’d at that men would tell their children “this is he ” others would say “where which is bolingbroke ” and then i stole all courtesy from heaven and dress’d myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king
thus did i keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical ne’er seen but wonder’d at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity
so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afford no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sun like majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowsed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and render’d such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full
and in that very line harry standest thou for thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation
not an eye but is a weary of thy common sight save mine which hath desired to see thee more which now doth that i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness
i shall hereafter my thrice gracious lord be more myself
for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh and even as i was then is percy now
now by my sceptre and my soul to boot he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession
for of no right nor colour like to right he doth fill fields with harness in the realm turns head against the lion’s armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms
what never dying honour hath he got against renowned douglas
whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
thrice hath this hotspur mars in swathing clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas ta’en him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne
and what say you to this
percy northumberland the archbishop’s grace of york douglas mortimer capitulate against us and are up
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee
why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest and dearest enemy
thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy’s pay to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns to show how much thou art degenerate
do not think so you shall not find it so
and god forgive them that so much have sway’d your majesty’s good thoughts away from me
i will redeem all this on percy’s head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask which wash’d away shall scour my shame with it
and that shall be the day whene’er it lights that this same child of honour and renown this gallant hotspur this all praised knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet
for every honour sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled
for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities
percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart
this in the name of god i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform i do beseech your majesty may salve the long grown wounds of my intemperance
if not the end of life cancels all bands and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
a hundred thousand rebels die in this
thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
thy looks are full of speed
so hath the business that i come to speak of
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury
a mighty and a fearful head they are if promises be kept on every hand as ever offer’d foul play in a state
the earl of westmoreland set forth today with him my son lord john of lancaster for this advertisement is five days old
on wednesday next you harry shall set forward on thursday we ourselves will march
and harry you shall march through gloustershire by which account our business valued some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet
our hands are full of business
let’s away advantage feeds him fat while men delay
a room in the boar’s head tavern
bardolph am i not fallen away vilely since this last action
why my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s loose gown
i am withered like an old apple john
well i’ll repent and that suddenly while i am in some liking
i shall be out of heart shortly and then i shall have no strength to repent
an i have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of i am a peppercorn a brewer’s horse
company villainous company hath been the spoil of me
sir john you are so fretful you cannot live long
come sing me a song make me merry
i was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be virtuous enough swore little diced not above seven times—a week went to a bawdy house not above once in a quarter—in an hour paid money that i borrowed—three or four times lived well and in good compass and now i live out of all order out of all compass
why you are so fat sir john that you must needs be out of all compass out of all reasonable compass sir john
do thou amend thy face and i’ll amend my life
thou art our admiral thou bearest the lantern in the poop but ’tis in the nose of thee
thou art the knight of the burning lamp
why sir john my face does you no harm
no i’ll be sworn i make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s head or a memento mori
i never see thy face but i think upon hell fire and dives that lived in purple for there he is in his robes burning burning
if thou wert any way given to virtue i would swear by thy face
my oath should be “by this fire that’s god’s angel ” but thou art altogether given over and wert indeed but for the light in thy face the son of utter darkness
when thou ran’st up gad’s hill in the night to catch my horse if i did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire there’s no purchase in money
o thou art a perpetual triumph an everlasting bonfire light
thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in europe
i have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years god reward me for it
’sblood i would my face were in your belly
so should i be sure to be heartburnt
how now dame partlet the hen have you enquired yet who picked my pocket
why sir john what do you think sir john do you think i keep thieves in my house
i have searched i have enquired so has my husband man by man boy by boy servant by servant
the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before
bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair and i’ll be sworn my pocket was picked
go to you are a woman go
no i defy thee god’s light i was never called so in mine own house before
go to i know you well enough
no sir john you do not know me sir john
i know you sir john you owe me money sir john and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it
i bought you a dozen of shirts to your back
i have given them away to bakers’ wives and they have made bolters of them
now as i am a true woman holland of eight shillings an ell
you owe money here besides sir john for your diet and by drinkings and money lent you four and twenty pound
he had his part of it let him pay
alas he is poor he hath nothing
let them coin his nose let them coin his cheeks
what will you make a younker of me
shall i not take mine ease in mine inn but i shall have my pocket picked
i have lost a seal ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark
o jesu i have heard the prince tell him i know not how oft that that ring was copper
the prince is a jack a sneak up
’sblood an he were here i would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so
enter prince henry with peto marching
falstaff meets him playing on his truncheon like a fife
is the wind in that door i’faith
yea two and two newgate fashion
my lord i pray you hear me
i love him well he is an honest man
prithee let her alone and list to me
the other night i fell asleep here behind the arras and had my pocket picked
this house is turned bawdy house they pick pockets
wilt thou believe me hal three or four bonds of forty pound apiece and a seal ring of my grandfather’s
so i told him my lord and i said i heard your grace say so
and my lord he speaks most vilely of you like a foul mouthed man as he is and said he would cudgel you
there’s neither faith truth nor womanhood in me else
there’s no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox and for woman hood maid marian may be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee
why a thing to thank god on
i am no thing to thank god on i would thou shouldst know it
i am an honest man’s wife and setting thy knighthood aside thou art a knave to call me so
setting thy womanhood aside thou art a beast to say otherwise
say what beast thou knave thou
why she’s neither fish nor flesh a man knows not where to have her
thou art an unjust man in saying so thou or any man knows where to have me thou knave thou
thou say’st true hostess and he slanders thee most grossly
so he doth you my lord and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound
sirrah do i owe you a thousand pound
thy love is worth a million thou owest me thy love
nay my lord he call’d you jack and said he would cudgel you
indeed sir john you said so
yea if he said my ring was copper
darest thou be as good as thy word now
why hal thou knowest as thou art but man i dare but as thou art prince i fear thee as i fear the roaring of the lion’s whelp
and why not as the lion
the king himself is to be feared as the lion
dost thou think i’ll fear thee as i fear thy father
nay an i do i pray god my girdle break
o if it should how would thy guts fall about thy knees
but sirrah there’s no room for faith truth nor honesty in this bosom of thine it is all filled up with midriff
charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket
why thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern reckonings memorandums of bawdy houses and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long winded if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these i am a villain
and yet you will stand to it you will not pocket up wrong
thou knowest in the state of innocency adam fell and what should poor jack falstaff do in the days of villainy
thou seest i have more flesh than another man and therefore more frailty
you confess then you picked my pocket
it appears so by the story
go make ready breakfast love thy husband look to thy servants cherish thy guests
thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason
thou seest i am pacified still
exit hostess now hal to the news at court
for the robbery lad how is that answered
o my sweet beef i must still be good angel to thee
the money is paid back again
o i do not like that paying back ’tis a double labour
i am good friends with my father and may do anything
rob me the exchequer the first thing thou dost and do it with unwashed hands too
i have procured thee jack a charge of foot
i would it had been of horse
where shall i find one that can steal well
o for a fine thief of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts
well god be thanked for these rebels they offend none but the virtuous
i laud them i praise them
go bear this letter to lord john of lancaster to my brother john this to my lord of westmoreland
exit bardolph go peto to horse to horse for thou and i have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time
exit peto jack meet me tomorrow in the temple hall at two o’clock in the afternoon there shalt thou know thy charge and there receive money and order for their furniture
the land is burning percy stands on high and either we or they must lower lie
brave world —hostess my breakfast come — o i could wish this tavern were my drum
if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this season’s stamp should go so general current through the world
by god i cannot flatter i do defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my heart’s love hath no man than yourself
nay task me to my word approve me lord
thou art the king of honour
no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him
these letters come from your father
he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time
under whose government come they along
his letters bear his mind not i my lord
i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
he did my lord four days ere i set forth and at the time of my departure thence he was much fear’d by his physicians
i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited
his health was never better worth than now
this sickness doth infect the very life blood of our enterprise ’tis catching hither even to our camp
he writes me here that inward sickness— and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn no did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own
yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possess’d of all our purposes
your father’s sickness is a maim to us
a perilous gash a very limb lopp’d off— and yet in faith it is not
his present want seems more than we shall find it
were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast
to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
it were not good for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope the very list the very utmost bound of all our fortunes
faith and so we should where now remains a sweet reversion
we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in
a comfort of retirement lives in this
a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs
but yet i would your father had been here
the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division
it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence
and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause
for well you know we of the off’ring side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement and stop all sight holes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us
this absence of your father’s draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of
i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against the kingdom with his help we shall o’erturn it topsy turvy down
yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
there is not such a word spoke in scotland as this term of fear
pray god my news be worth a welcome lord
the earl of westmoreland seven thousand strong is marching hitherwards with him prince john
and further i have learn’d the king himself in person is set forth or hitherwards intended speedily with strong and mighty preparation
where is his son the nimble footed madcap prince of wales and his comrades that daffed the world aside and bid it pass
all furnish’d all in arms all plumed like estridges that with the wind bated like eagles having lately bathed glittering in golden coats like images as full of spirit as the month of may and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
i saw young harry with his beaver on his cuisses on his thighs gallantly arm’d rise from the ground like feather’d mercury and vaulted with such ease into his seat as if an angel dropp’d down from the clouds to turn and wind a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship
worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues
they come like sacrifices in their trim and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them
the mailed mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood
i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours
come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales
harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne’er part till one drop down a corse
i learn’d in worcester as i rode along he cannot draw his power this fourteen days
that’s the worst tidings that i hear of yet
ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
what may the king’s whole battle reach unto
my father and glendower being both away the powers of us may serve so great a day
come let us take a muster speedily
doomsday is near die all die merrily
i am out of fear of death or death’s hand for this one half year
bardolph get thee before to coventry fill me a bottle of sack
our soldiers shall march through we’ll to sutton co’fil’ tonight
will you give me money captain
an if it do take it for thy labour
an if it make twenty take them all i’ll answer the coinage
bid my lieutenant peto meet me at town’s end
if i be not ashamed of my soldiers i am a soused gurnet
i have misused the king’s press damnably
i have got in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds
i press me none but good householders yeomen’s sons inquire me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck
a mad fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies
no eye hath seen such scarecrows
i’ll not march through coventry with them that’s flat
nay and the villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on for indeed i had the most of them out of prison
there’s not a shirt and a half in all my company and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth stolen from my host at saint albans or the red nose innkeeper of daventry
but that’s all one they’ll find linen enough on every hedge
enter prince henry and the lord of westmoreland
what a devil dost thou in warwickshire
my good lord of westmoreland i cry you mercy
i thought your honour had already been at shrewsbury
faith sir john ’tis more than time that i were there and you too but my powers are there already
the king i can tell you looks for us all
i am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream
i think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already made thee butter
but tell me jack whose fellows are these that come after
i did never see such pitiful rascals
tut tut good enough to toss food for powder food for powder they’ll fill a pit as well as better
tush man mortal men mortal men
ay but sir john methinks they are exceeding poor and bare too beggarly
faith for their poverty i know not where they had that and for their bareness i am sure they never learned that of me
no i’ll be sworn unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare
percy is already in the field
i fear we shall stay too long
well to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast fits a dull fighter and a keen guest
enter hotspur worcester douglas and vernon
his is certain ours is doubtful
good cousin be advised stir not tonight
you speak it out of fear and cold heart
do me no slander douglas by my life and i dare well maintain it with my life if well respected honour bid me on i hold as little counsel with weak fear as you my lord or any scot that this day lives
let it be seen tomorrow in the battle which of us fears
come come it may not be
i wonder much being men of such great leading as you are that you foresee not what impediments drag back our expedition
certain horse of my cousin vernon’s are not yet come up
your uncle worcester’s horse came but today and now their pride and mettle is asleep their courage with hard labour tame and dull that not a horse is half the half himself
so are the horses of the enemy in general journey bated and brought low
the better part of ours are full of rest
the number of the king exceedeth ours
for god’s sake cousin stay till all come in
the trumpet sounds a parley enter sir walter blunt
i come with gracious offers from the king if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
welcome sir walter blunt and would to god you were of our determination
some of us love you well and even those some envy your great deservings and good name because you are not of our quality but stand against us like an enemy
and god defend but still i should stand so so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty
the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty
if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot which he confesseth to be manifold he bids you name your griefs and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion
the king is kind and well we know the king knows at what time to promise when to pay
my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears and when he was not six and twenty strong sick in the world’s regard wretched and low a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home my father gave him welcome to the shore and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster to sue his livery and beg his peace with tears of innocence and terms of zeal my father in kind heart and pity moved swore him assistance and performed it too
now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him the more and less came in with cap and knee met him in boroughs cities villages attended him on bridges stood in lanes laid gifts before him proffer’d him their oaths give him their heirs as pages follow’d him even at the heels in golden multitudes
tut i came not to hear this
in short time after he deposed the king soon after that deprived him of his life and in the neck of that task’d the whole state
to make that worse suffer’d his kinsman march who is if every owner were well placed indeed his king to be engaged in wales there without ransom to lie forfeited disgraced me in my happy victories sought to entrap me by intelligence rated mine uncle from the council board in rage dismiss’d my father from the court broke oath on oath committed wrong on wrong and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety and withal to pry into his title the which now we find too indirect for long continuance
shall i return this answer to the king
go to the king and let there be impawn’d some surety for a safe return again and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes
i would you would accept of grace and love
a room in the archbishop’s palace
enter the archbishop of york and sir michael
hie good sir michael bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal this to my cousin scroop and all the rest to whom they are directed
if you knew how much they do import you would make haste
my good lord i guess their tenour
tomorrow good sir michael is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch for sir at shrewsbury as i am truly given to understand the king with mighty and quick raised power meets with lord harry
and i fear sir michael what with the sickness of northumberland whose power was in the first proportion and what with owen glendower’s absence thence who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in o’er rul’d by prophecies i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king
why my good lord you need not fear there is douglas and lord mortimer
but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales lord john of lancaster the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt and many more corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms
doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed
i hope no less yet needful ’tis to fear and to prevent the worst sir michael speed
for if lord percy thrive not ere the king dismiss his power he means to visit us for he hath heard of our confederacy and ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him
i must go write again to other friends and so farewell sir michael
enter king henry prince henry lancaster sir walter blunt and sir john falstaff
how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon bulky hill
the day looks pale at his distemp’rature
the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blust’ring day
then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win
how now my lord of worcester
’tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet
you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
this is not well my lord this is not well
will you again unknit this churlish knot of all abhorred war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times
hear me my liege for mine own part i could be well content to entertain the lag end of my life with quiet hours
for i do protest i have not sought the day of this dislike
rebellion lay in his way and he found it
it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house and yet i must remember you my lord we were the first and dearest of your friends
for you my staff of office did i break in richard’s time and posted day and night to meet you on the way and kiss your hand when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i
it was myself my brother and his son that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time
you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose ’gainst the state nor claim no further than your new fall’n right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster
to this we swore our aid
these things indeed you have articulate proclaim’d at market crosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation
and never yet did insurrection want such water colours to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion
in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial
tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy
by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more active valiant or more valiant young more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds
for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he doth account me too
yet this before my father’s majesty— i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight
and prince of wales so dare we venture thee albeit considerations infinite do make against it —no good worcester no
we love our people well even those we love that are misled upon your cousin’s part and will they take the offer of our grace both he and they and you yea every man shall be my friend again and i’ll be his
so tell your cousin and then bring me word what he will do
but if he will not yield rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office
so be gone we will not now be troubled with reply
we offer fair take it advisedly
it will not be accepted on my life
the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms
hence therefore every leader to his charge for on their answer will we set on them and god befriend us as our cause is just
exeunt the king blunt and prince john falstaff
hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so ’tis a point of friendship
nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship
i would ’twere bedtime hal and all well
why thou owest god a death
’tis not due yet i would be loth to pay him before his day
what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me
well ’tis no matter honour pricks me on
yea but how if honour prick me off when i come on
can honor set to a leg
or take away the grief of a wound
honour hath no skill in surgery then
what is in that word “honour”
but will it not live with the living
o no my nephew must not know sir richard the liberal and kind offer of the king
it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults
suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes for treason is but trusted like the fox who ne’er so tame so cherish’d and lock’d up will have a wild trick of his ancestors
look how we can or sad or merrily interpretation will misquote our looks and we shall feed like oxen at a stall the better cherish’d still the nearer death
my nephew’s trespass may be well forgot it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood and an adopted name of privilege— a hare brain’d hotspur govern’d by a spleen
all his offences live upon my head and on his father’s
we did train him on and his corruption being ta’en from us we as the spring of all shall pay for all
therefore good cousin let not harry know in any case the offer of the king
deliver what you will i’ll say ’tis so
enter hotspur and douglas officers and soldiers behind
deliver up my lord of westmoreland
the king will bid you battle presently
defy him by the lord of westmoreland
lord douglas go you and tell him so
marry i shall and very willingly
there is no seeming mercy in the king
i told him gently of our grievances of his oath breaking which he mended thus by now forswearing that he is forsworn
he calls us rebels traitors and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us
for i have thrown a brave defiance in king henry’s teeth and westmoreland that was engaged did bear it which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
the prince of wales stepp’d forth before the king and nephew challenged you to single fight
o would the quarrel lay upon our heads and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth
tell me tell me how show’d his tasking
i never in my life did hear a challenge urged more modestly unless a brother should a brother dare to gentle exercise and proof of arms
he gave you all the duties of a man trimm’d up your praises with a princely tongue spoke your deservings like a chronicle making you ever better than his praise by still dispraising praise valued with you and which became him like a prince indeed he made a blushing cital of himself and chid his truant youth with such a grace as if he master’d there a double spirit of teaching and of learning instantly
there did he pause but let me tell the world if he outlive the envy of this day england did never owe so sweet a hope so much misconstrued in his wantonness
cousin i think thou art enamoured upon his follies
never did i hear of any prince so wild a liberty
but be he as he will yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier’s arm that he shall shrink under my courtesy
and fellows soldiers friends better consider what you have to do than i that have not well the gift of tongue can lift your blood up with persuasion
my lord here are letters for you
i cannot read them now — o gentlemen the time of life is short
to spend that shortness basely were too long if life did ride upon a dial’s point still ending at the arrival of an hour
and if we live we live to tread on kings if die brave death when princes die with us
now for our consciences the arms are fair when the intent of bearing them is just
i thank him that he cuts me from my tale for i profess not talking
only this let each man do his best
and here draw i a sword whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day
sound all the lofty instruments of war and by that music let us all embrace for heaven to earth some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy
they embrace and exeunt scene iii
the king enters with his power
then enter douglas and sir walter blunt
what is thy name that in the battle thus thou crossest me
what honour dost thou seek upon my head
know then my name is douglas and i do haunt thee in the battle thus because some tell me that thou art a king
the lord of stafford dear today hath bought thy likeness for instead of thee king harry this sword hath ended him
so shall it thee unless thou yield thee as my prisoner
i was not born a yielder thou proud scot and thou shalt find a king that will revenge lord stafford’s death
they fight and blunt is slain enter hotspur
o douglas hadst thou fought at holmedon thus i never had triumphed upon a scot
all’s done all’s won here breathless lies the king
no i know this face full well
a gallant knight he was his name was blunt semblably furnish’d like the king himself
a fool go with thy soul whither it goes
a borrow’d title hast thou bought too dear
why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king
the king hath many marching in his coats
now by my sword i will kill all his coats i’ll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece until i meet the king
our soldiers stand full fairly for the day
though i could scape shot free at london i fear the shot here
here’s no scoring but upon the pate —soft
i am as hot as molten lead and as heavy too
god keep lead out of me i need no more weight than mine own bowels
i have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered
there’s not three of my hundred and fifty left alive and they are for the town’s end to beg during life
many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies whose deaths are yet unrevenged
i prithee lend me thy sword
o hal i prithee give me leave to breathe awhile
turk gregory never did such deeds in arms as i have done this day
i have paid percy i have made him sure
he is indeed and living to kill thee
i prithee lend me thy sword
nay before god hal if percy be alive thou gett’st not my sword but take my pistol if thou wilt
what is it in the case
ay hal ’tis hot ’tis hot
there’s that will sack a city
the prince draws out a bottle of sack prince
what is it a time to jest and dally now
throws it at him and exit falstaff
well if percy be alive i’ll pierce him
if he do come in my way so if he do not if i come in his willingly let him make a carbonado of me
i like not such grinning honour as sir walter hath
give me life which if i can save so if not honour comes unlooked for and there’s an end
enter king henry prince henry lancaster and westmoreland
i prithee harry withdraw thyself thou bleedest too much
lord john of lancaster go you with him
not i my lord unless i did bleed too
i do beseech your majesty make up lest your retirement do amaze your friends
my lord of westmoreland lead him to his tent
come my lord i’ll lead you to your tent
i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this where stain’d nobility lies trodden on and rebels’ arms triumph in massacres
come cousin westmoreland our duty this way lies
by heaven thou hast deceived me lancaster i did not think thee lord of such a spirit
before i loved thee as a brother john but now i do respect thee as my soul
i saw him hold lord percy at the point with lustier maintenance than i did look for of such an ungrown warrior
o this boy lends mettle to us all
i am the douglas fatal to all those that wear those colours on them
what art thou that counterfeit’st the person of a king
the king himself who douglas grieves at heart so many of his shadows thou hast met and not the very king
i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but seeing thou fall’st on me so luckily i will assay thee and defend thyself
i fear thou art another counterfeit and yet in faith thou bearest thee like a king
but mine i am sure thou art whoe’er thou be and thus i win thee
they fight the king being in danger enter prince henry
hold up thy head vile scot or thou art like never to hold it up again
the spirits of valiant shirley stafford blunt are in my arms
it is the prince of wales that threatens thee who never promiseth but he means to pay
sir nicholas gawsey hath for succour sent and so hath clifton
thou hast redeem’d thy lost opinion and show’d thou mak’st some tender of my life in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me
o god they did me too much injury that ever said i hearken’d for your death
if it were so i might have let alone the insulting hand of douglas over you which would have been as speedy in your end as all the poisonous potions in the world and saved the treacherous labour of your son
if i mistake not thou art harry monmouth
thou speak’st as if i would deny my name
why then i see a very valiant rebel of the name
i am the prince of wales and think not percy to share with me in glory any more
two stars keep not their motion in one sphere nor can one england brook a double reign of harry percy and the prince of wales
nor shall it harry for the hour is come to end the one of us and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine
i’ll make it greater ere i part from thee and all the budding honours on thy crest i’ll crop to make a garland for my head
i can no longer brook thy vanities
nay you shall find no boy’s play here i can tell you
he fights with falstaff who falls down as if he were dead and exit douglas
o harry thou hast robb’d me of my youth
i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me they wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh
but thoughts the slaves of life and life time’s fool and time that takes survey of all the world must have a stop
o i could prophesy but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue
no percy thou art dust and food for— dies prince
ill weaved ambition how much art thou shrunk
when that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough
this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman
if thou wert sensible of courtesy i should not make so dear a show of zeal
but let my favours hide thy mangled face and even in thy behalf i’ll thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness
adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remember’d in thy epitaph
sees falstaff on the ground what old acquaintance could not all this flesh keep in a little life
i could have better spared a better man
o i should have a heavy miss of thee if i were much in love with vanity
death hath not struck so fat a deer today though many dearer in this bloody fray
embowell’d will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie
if thou embowel me today i’ll give you leave to powder me and eat me too tomorrow
’sblood ’twas time to counterfeit or that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too
i lie i am no counterfeit
to die is to be a counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image of life indeed
the better part of valour is discretion in the which better part i have saved my life
zounds i am afraid of this gunpowder percy though he be dead
how if he should counterfeit too and rise
by my faith i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit
therefore i’ll make him sure yea and i’ll swear i killed him
why may not he rise as well as i
nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me
therefore sirrah with a new wound in your thigh come you along with me
takes hotspur on his back enter prince henry and lancaster
come brother john full bravely hast thou flesh’d thy maiden sword
but soft whom have we here
did you not tell me this fat man was dead
i did i saw him dead breathless and bleeding on the ground —art thou alive
or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight
i prithee speak we will not trust our eyes without our ears
thou art not what thou seem’st
no that’s certain i am not a double man
but if i be not jack falstaff then am i a jack
throwing the body down if your father will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next percy himself
i look to be either earl or duke i can assure you
why percy i kill’d myself and saw thee dead
lord lord how this world is given to lying
i grant you i was down and out of breath and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock
if i may be believed so if not let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads
i’ll take it upon my death i gave him this wound in the thigh
if the man were alive and would deny it zounds i would make him eat a piece of my sword
this is the strangest tale that ever i heard
this is the strangest fellow brother john — come bring your luggage nobly on your back
for my part if a lie may do thee grace i’ll gild it with the happiest terms i have
a retreat is sounded the trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
come brother let us to the highest of the field to see what friends are living who are dead
exeunt prince henry and lancaster falstaff

thus ever did rebellion find rebuke
ill spirited worcester did not we send grace pardon and terms of love to all of you
and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary
misuse the tenour of thy kinsman’s trust
three knights upon our party slain today a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence
what i have done my safety urged me to and i embrace this fortune patiently since not to be avoided it falls on me
bear worcester to the death and vernon too
other offenders we will pause upon
exeunt worcester and vernon guarded how goes the field
the noble scot lord douglas when he saw the fortune of the day quite turn’d from him the noble percy slain and all his men upon the foot of fear fled with the rest and falling from a hill he was so bruised that the pursuers took him
at my tent the douglas is and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him
then brother john of lancaster to you this honourable bounty shall belong
go to the douglas and deliver him up to his pleasure ransomless and free
his valours shown upon our crests today hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries
i thank your grace for this high courtesy which i shall give away immediately
then this remains that we divide our power
you son john and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop who as we hear are busily in arms
myself and you son harry will towards wales to fight with glendower and the earl of march
rebellion in this land shall lose his sway meeting the check of such another day and since this business so fair is done let us not leave till all our own be won

enter rumour painted full of tongues
open your ears for which of you will stop the vent of hearing when loud rumour speaks
i from the orient to the drooping west making the wind my post horse still unfold the acts commenced on this ball of earth
upon my tongues continual slanders ride the which in every language i pronounce stuffing the ears of men with false reports
i speak of peace while covert enmity under the smile of safety wounds the world
and who but rumour who but only i make fearful musters and prepared defence whiles the big year swoln with some other grief is thought with child by the stern tyrant war and no such matter
rumour is a pipe blown by surmises jealousies conjectures and of so easy and so plain a stop that the blunt monster with uncounted heads the still discordant wav’ring multitude can play upon it
but what need i thus my well known body to anatomize among my household
i run before king harry’s victory who in a bloody field by shrewsbury hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops quenching the flame of bold rebellion even with the rebels’ blood
but what mean i to speak so true at first
my office is to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell under the wrath of noble hotspur’s sword and that the king before the douglas’ rage stoop’d his anointed head as low as death
this have i rumour’d through the peasant towns between that royal field of shrewsbury and this worm eaten hold of ragged stone where hotspur’s father old northumberland lies crafty sick
the posts come tiring on and not a man of them brings other news than they have learnt of me
from rumour’s tongues they bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs
who keeps the gate here ho
what shall i say you are
tell thou the earl that the lord bardolph doth attend him here
his lordship is walk’d forth into the orchard
please it your honour knock but at the gate and he himself will answer
every minute now should be the father of some stratagem
the times are wild contention like a horse full of high feeding madly hath broke loose and bears down all before him
noble earl i bring you certain news from shrewsbury
as good as heart can wish
the king is almost wounded to the death and in the fortune of my lord your son prince harry slain outright and both the blunts kill’d by the hand of douglas young prince john and westmoreland and stafford fled the field and harry monmouth’s brawn the hulk sir john is prisoner to your son
o such a day so fought so follow’d and so fairly won came not till now to dignify the times since caesar’s fortunes
i spake with one my lord that came from thence a gentleman well bred and of good name that freely render’d me these news for true
here comes my servant travers whom i sent on tuesday last to listen after news
my lord i over rode him on the way and he is furnish’d with no certainties more than he haply may retail from me
now travers what good tidings comes with you
my lord sir john umfrevile turn’d me back with joyful tidings and being better horsed out rode me
after him came spurring hard a gentleman almost forspent with speed that stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse
he ask’d the way to chester and of him i did demand what news from shrewsbury
he told me that rebellion had bad luck and that young harry percy’s spur was cold
with that he gave his able horse the head and bending forward struck his armed heels against the panting sides of his poor jade up to the rowel head and starting so he seem’d in running to devour the way staying no longer question
again said he young harry percy’s spur was cold
that rebellion had met ill luck
my lord i’ll tell you what if my young lord your son have not the day upon mine honour for a silken point i’ll give my barony never talk of it
why should that gentleman that rode by travers give then such instances of loss
he was some hilding fellow that had stolen the horse he rode on and upon my life spoke at a venture
yea this man’s brow like to a title leaf foretells the nature of a tragic volume
so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood hath left a witness’d usurpation
say morton didst thou come from shrewsbury
i ran from shrewsbury my noble lord where hateful death put on his ugliest mask to fright our party
how doth my son and brother
thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
even such a man so faint so spiritless so dull so dread in look so woe begone drew priam’s curtain in the dead of night and would have told him half his troy was burnt but priam found the fire ere he his tongue and i my percy’s death ere thou report’st it
this thou wouldst say “your son did thus and thus your brother thus so fought the noble douglas” stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds but in the end to stop my ear indeed thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise ending with “brother son and all are dead ” morton
douglas is living and your brother yet but for my lord your son— northumberland
see what a ready tongue suspicion hath
he that but fears the thing he would not know hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes that what he fear’d is chanced
yet speak morton tell thou an earl his divination lies and i will take it as a sweet disgrace and make thee rich for doing me such wrong
you are too great to be by me gainsaid your spirit is too true your fears too certain
yet for all this say not that percy’s dead
i see a strange confession in thine eye
thou shakest thy head and hold’st it fear or sin to speak a truth
if he be slain say so
the tongue offends not that reports his death and he doth sin that doth belie the dead not he which says the dead is not alive
yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell remember’d tolling a departing friend
i cannot think my lord your son is dead
i am sorry i should force you to believe that which i would to god i had not seen but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state rend’ring faint quittance wearied and outbreathed to harry monmouth whose swift wrath beat down the never daunted percy to the earth from whence with life he never more sprung up
in few his death whose spirit lent a fire even to the dullest peasant in his camp being bruited once took fire and heat away from the best temper’d courage in his troops for from his metal was his party steel’d which once in him abated all the rest turn’d on themselves like dull and heavy lead
and as the thing that’s heavy in itself upon enforcement flies with greatest speed so did our men heavy in hotspur’s loss lend to this weight such lightness with their fear that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim than did our soldiers aiming at their safety fly from the field
then was that noble worcester too soon ta’en prisoner and that furious scot the bloody douglas whose well labouring sword had three times slain th’ appearance of the king gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame of those that turn’d their backs and in his flight stumbling in fear was took
the sum of all is that the king hath won and hath sent out a speedy power to encounter you my lord under the conduct of young lancaster and westmoreland
this is the news at full
for this i shall have time enough to mourn
in poison there is physic and these news having been well that would have made me sick being sick have in some measure made me well
and as the wretch whose fever weaken’d joints like strengthless hinges buckle under life impatient of his fit breaks like a fire out of his keeper’s arms even so my limbs weaken’d with grief being now enraged with grief are thrice themselves
a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel must glove this hand
thou art a guard too wanton for the head which princes flesh’d with conquest aim to hit
now bind my brows with iron and approach the ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring to frown upon th’ enraged northumberland
now let not nature’s hand keep the wild flood confined
and let this world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act but let one spirit of the first born cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the rude scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead
this strained passion doth you wrong my lord
sweet earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
the lives of all your loving complices lean on your health the which if you give o’er to stormy passion must perforce decay
you cast th’ event of war my noble lord and summ’d the account of chance before you said “let us make head ” it was your presurmise that in the dole of blows your son might drop
you knew he walk’d o’er perils on an edge more likely to fall in than to get o’er
you were advised his flesh was capable of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit would lift him where most trade of danger ranged
yet did you say “go forth ” and none of this though strongly apprehended could restrain the stiff borne action
what hath then befall’n or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth more than that being which was like to be
we all that are engaged to this loss knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas that if we wrought out life ’twas ten to one and yet we ventured for the gain proposed choked the respect of likely peril fear’d and since we are o’erset venture again
come we will put forth body and goods
and my most noble lord i hear for certain and dare speak the truth the gentle archbishop of york is up with well appointed powers
he is a man who with a double surety binds his followers
my lord your son had only but the corpse but shadows and the shows of men to fight for that same word “rebellion” did divide the action of their bodies from their souls and they did fight with queasiness constrain’d as men drink potions that their weapons only seem’d on our side but for their spirits and souls this word “rebellion ” it had froze them up as fish are in a pond
but now the bishop turns insurrection to religion
supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts he’s follow’d both with body and with mind and doth enlarge his rising with the blood of fair king richard scraped from pomfret stones derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land gasping for life under great bolingbroke and more and less do flock to follow him
i knew of this before but to speak truth this present grief had wiped it from my mind
go in with me and counsel every man the aptest way for safety and revenge
get posts and letters and make friends with speed
never so few and never yet more need
enter falstaff with his page bearing his sword and buckler
sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
he said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he knew for
men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me
the brain of this foolish compounded clay man is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter more than i invent or is invented on me
i am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men
i do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one
if the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then i have no judgement
thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels
i was never manned with an agate till now but i will inset you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel —the juvenal the prince your master whose chin is not yet fledge
i will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal
god may finish it when he will ’tis not a hair amiss yet
he may keep it still at a face royal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it
and yet he’ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor
he may keep his own grace but he’s almost out of mine i can assure him
what said master dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops
he said sir you should procure him better assurance than bardolph
he would not take his band and yours he liked not the security
let him be damned like the glutton
pray god his tongue be hotter
a rascally yea forsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security
the whoreson smooth pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security
i had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security
i looked he should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as i am a true knight and he sends me “security”
well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
he’s gone into smithfield to buy your worship a horse
i bought him in paul’s and he’ll buy me a horse in smithfield
an i could get me but a wife in the stews i were manned horsed and wived
enter the lord chief justice and servant
sir here comes the nobleman that committed the prince for striking him about bardolph
wait close i will not see him
falstaff an ’t please your lordship
he that was in question for the robbery
he my lord but he hath since done good service at shrewsbury and as i hear is now going with some charge to the lord john of lancaster
boy tell him i am deaf
you must speak louder my master is deaf
i am sure he is to the hearing of anything good
go pluck him by the elbow i must speak with him
doth not the king lack subjects
do not the rebels need soldiers
though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it
why sir did i say you were an honest man
setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside i had lied in my throat if i had said so
i pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say i am any other than an honest man
i give thee leave to tell me so
i lay aside that which grows to me
if thou get’st any leave of me hang me if thou tak’st leave thou wert better be hanged
sir my lord would speak with you
sir john falstaff a word with you
god give your lordship good time of day
i am glad to see your lordship abroad
i heard say your lordship was sick
i hope your lordship goes abroad by advice
your lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and i most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health
sir john i sent for you before your expedition to shrewsbury
an ’t please your lordship i hear his majesty is returned with some discomfort from wales
i talk not of his majesty
you would not come when i sent for you
and i hear moreover his highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy
i pray you let me speak with you
this apoplexy as i take it is a kind of lethargy an ’t please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson tingling
what tell you me of it
it hath it original from much grief from study and perturbation of the brain
i have read the cause of his effects in galen
it is a kind of deafness
i think you are fallen into the disease for you hear not what i say to you
very well my lord very well
rather an ’t please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that i am troubled withal
to punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and i care not if i do become your physician
i am as poor as job my lord but not so patient
your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how i should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself
i sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to come speak with me
as i was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land service i did not come
well the truth is sir john you live in great infamy
he that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less
your means are very slender and your waste is great
i would it were otherwise i would my means were greater and my waist slenderer
you have misled the youthful prince
the young prince hath misled me
i am the fellow with the great belly and he my dog
well i am loath to gall a new healed wound
your day’s service at shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night’s exploit on gad’s hill
you may thank th’ unquiet time for your quiet o’er posting that action
but since all is well keep it so wake not a sleeping wolf
to wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox
you are as a candle the better part burnt out
a wassail candle my lord all tallow
if i did say of wax my growth would approve the truth
there is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravity
his effect of gravy gravy gravy
you follow the young prince up and down like his ill angel
not so my lord your ill angel is light but i hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing
and yet in some respects i grant i cannot go
virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers’ times that true valour is turned bearherd pregnancy is made a tapster and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings
all the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry
you that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our youth i must confess are wags too
do you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down old with all the characters of age
have you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing belly
is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity
and will you yet call yourself young
my lord i was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly
for my voice i have lost it with halloing and singing of anthems
to approve my youth further i will not
the truth is i am only old in judgement and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him
for the box of the ear that the prince gave you he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord
i have checked him for it and the young lion repents
marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk and old sack
well god send the prince a better companion
god send the companion a better prince
i cannot rid my hands of him
well the king hath severed you and prince harry
i hear you are going with lord john of lancaster against the archbishop and the earl of northumberland
yea i thank your pretty sweet wit for it
but look you pray all you that kiss my lady peace at home that our armies join not in a hot day for by the lord i take but two shirts out with me and i mean not to sweat extraordinarily
if it be a hot day and i brandish anything but a bottle i would i might never spit white again
there is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but i am thrust upon it
but it was alway yet the trick of our english nation if they have a good thing to make it too common
if ye will needs say i am an old man you should give me rest
i would to god my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is
i were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion
well be honest be honest and god bless your expedition
will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth
not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses
fare you well commend me to my cousin westmoreland
exeunt chief justice and servant falstaff
if i do fillip me with a three man beetle
a man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the degrees prevent my curses
what money is in my purse
i can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse
borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease is incurable
go bear this letter to my lord of lancaster this to the prince this to the earl of westmoreland and this to old mistress ursula whom i have weekly sworn to marry since i perceived the first white hair of my chin
you know where to find me
or a gout of this pox
for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe
’tis no matter if i do halt i have the wars for my colour and my pension shall seem the more reasonable
a good wit will make use of anything
i will turn diseases to commodity
enter the archbishop the lords hastings mowbray and bardolph
thus have you heard our cause and known our means and my most noble friends i pray you all speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
and first lord marshal what say you to it
i well allow the occasion of our arms but gladly would be better satisfied how in our means we should advance ourselves to look with forehead bold and big enough upon the power and puissance of the king
our present musters grow upon the file to five and twenty thousand men of choice and our supplies live largely in the hope of great northumberland whose bosom burns with an incensed fire of injuries
the question then lord hastings standeth thus whether our present five and twenty thousand may hold up head without northumberland
yea marry there’s the point but if without him we be thought too feeble my judgement is we should not step too far till we had his assistance by the hand for in a theme so bloody faced as this conjecture expectation and surmise of aids incertain should not be admitted
’tis very true lord bardolph for indeed it was young hotspur’s case at shrewsbury
it was my lord who lined himself with hope eating the air on promise of supply flatt’ring himself in project of a power much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts and so with great imagination proper to madmen led his powers to death and winking leap’d into destruction
but by your leave it never yet did hurt to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
yes if this present quality of war— indeed the instant action a cause on foot— lives so in hope as in an early spring we see th’ appearing buds which to prove fruit hope gives not so much warrant as despair that frosts will bite them
when we mean to build we first survey the plot then draw the model and when we see the figure of the house then we must rate the cost of the erection which if we find outweighs ability what do we then but draw anew the model in fewer offices or at least desist to build at all
grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth should be still born and that we now possess’d the utmost man of expectation i think we are a body strong enough even as we are to equal with the king
what is the king but five and twenty thousand
to us no more nay not so much lord bardolph for his divisions as the times do brawl are in three heads one power against the french and one against glendower perforce a third must take up us
so is the unfirm king in three divided and his coffers sound with hollow poverty and emptiness
that he should draw his several strengths together and come against us in full puissance need not be dreaded
if he should do so he leaves his back unarm’d the french and welsh baying him at the heels never fear that
who is it like should lead his forces hither
the duke of lancaster and westmoreland against the welsh himself and harry monmouth but who is substituted ’gainst the french i have no certain notice
let us on and publish the occasion of our arms
the commonwealth is sick of their own choice their over greedy love hath surfeited
an habitation giddy and unsure hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
o thou fond many with what loud applause didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke before he was what thou wouldst have him be
and being now trimm’d in thine own desires thou beastly feeder art so full of him that thou provok’st thyself to cast him up
so so thou common dog didst thou disgorge thy glutton bosom of the royal richard and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up and howl’st to find it
what trust is in these times
they that when richard lived would have him die are now become enamour’d on his grave
thou that threw’st dust upon his goodly head when through proud london he came sighing on after th’ admired heels of bolingbroke criest now “o earth yield us that king again and take thou this ” o thoughts of men accursed
past and to come seems best things present worst
shall we go draw our numbers and set on
we are time’s subjects and time bids be gone

i pray you since my exion is entered and my case so openly known to the world let him be brought in to his answer
a hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear and i have borne and borne and borne and have been fubbed off and fubbed off and fubbed off from this day to that day that it is a shame to be thought on
there is no honesty in such dealing unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast to bear every knave’s wrong
yonder he comes and that arrant malmsey nose knave bardolph with him

good my lord be good to me
i beseech you stand to me
doth this become your place your time and business
you should have been well on your way to york
o my most worshipful lord an’t please your grace i am a poor widow of eastcheap and he is arrested at my suit
it is more than for some my lord it is for all all i have
he hath eaten me out of house and home
he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his but i will have some of it out again or i will ride thee o’ nights like the mare
i think i am as like to ride the mare if i have any vantage of ground to get up
what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation
are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own
what is the gross sum that i owe thee
marry if thou wert an honest man thyself and the money too
thou didst swear to me upon a parcel gilt goblet sitting in my dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea coal fire upon wednesday in wheeson week when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing man of windsor thou didst swear to me then as i was washing thy wound to marry me and make me my lady thy wife
did not goodwife keech the butcher’s wife come in then and call me gossip quickly
coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar telling us she had a good dish of prawns whereby thou didst desire to eat some whereby i told thee they were ill for green wound
and didst thou not when she was gone downstairs desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people saying that ere long they should call me madam
and didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings
i put thee now to thy book oath
my lord this is a poor mad soul and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you
she hath been in good case and the truth is poverty hath distracted her
but for these foolish officers i beseech you i may have redress against them
sir john sir john i am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way
it is not a confident brow nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you can thrust me from a level consideration
you have as it appears to me practised upon the easy yielding spirit of this woman and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person
pay her the debt you owe her and unpay the villany you have done with her
the one you may do with sterling money and the other with current repentance
my lord i will not undergo this sneap without reply
you call honourable boldness impudent sauciness if a man will make curtsy and say nothing he is virtuous
no my lord my humble duty remembered i will not be your suitor
i say to you i do desire deliverance from these officers being upon hasty employment in the king’s affairs
you speak as having power to do wrong but answer in th’ effect of your reputation and satisfy the poor woman
the king my lord and harry prince of wales are near at hand the rest the paper tells
come no more words of it
by this heavenly ground i tread on i must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining chambers

and for thy walls a pretty slight drollery or the story of the prodigal or the german hunting in waterwork is worth a thousand of these bed hangers and these fly bitten tapestries
let it be ten pound if thou canst
come an ’twere not for thy humours there’s not a better wench in england
go wash thy face and draw the action
come thou must not be in this humour with me dost not know me
come come i know thou wast set on to this
pray thee sir john let it be but twenty nobles
i’ faith i am loath to pawn my plate so god save me la
let it alone i’ll make other shift you’ll be a fool still
well you shall have it though i pawn my gown
i hope you’ll come to supper
will you have doll tearsheet meet you at supper
no more words let’s have her
exeunt hostess fang snare bardolph and page chief justice
i hope my lord all’s well
what is the news my lord
no fifteen hundred foot five hundred horse are march’d up to my lord of lancaster against northumberland and the archbishop
comes the king back from wales my noble lord
you shall have letters of me presently
come go along with me good master gower
master gower shall i entreat you with me to dinner
i must wait upon my good lord here i thank you good sir john
sir john you loiter here too long being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go
will you sup with me master gower
what foolish master taught you these manners sir john
master gower if they become me not he was a fool that taught them me
this is the right fencing grace my lord tap for tap and so part fair
now the lord lighten thee thou art a great fool
before god i am exceeding weary
i had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood
faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it
doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer
why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition
belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth i do now remember the poor creature small beer
but indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness
what a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name
or to know thy face tomorrow
or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast—viz
these and those that were thy peach coloured ones
or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for superfluity and another for use
but that the tennis court keeper knows better than i for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland
and god knows whether those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened
how ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly
tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is
shall i tell thee one thing poins
yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing
it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine
go to i stand the push of your one thing that you will tell
marry i tell thee it is not meet that i should be sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell to thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend i could be sad and sad indeed too
very hardly upon such a subject
by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and persistency
let the end try the man
but i tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
what wouldst thou think of me if i should weep
i would think thee a most princely hypocrite
it would be every man’s thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks
never a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite indeed
and what accites your most worshipful thought to think so
why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to falstaff
by this light i am well spoke on i can hear it with mine own ears
the worst that they can say of me is that i am a second brother and that i am a proper fellow of my hands and those two things i confess i cannot help
by the mass here comes bardolph
and the boy that i gave falstaff
he had him from me christian and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape
come you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing
what a maidenly man at arms are you become
is ’t such a matter to get a pottle pot’s maidenhead
he calls me e’en now my lord through a red lattice and i could discern no part of his face from the window
at last i spied his eyes and methought he had made two holes in the ale wife’s new petticoat and so peeped through
away you whoreson upright rabbit away
away you rascally althaea’s dream away
instruct us boy what dream boy
marry my lord althaea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand and therefore i call him her dream
a crown’s worth of good interpretation
o that this blossom could be kept from cankers
well there is sixpence to preserve thee
an you do not make him be hanged among you the gallows shall have wrong
and how doth thy master bardolph
he heard of your grace’s coming to town
and how doth the martlemas your master
marry the immortal part needs a physician but that moves not him
though that be sick it dies not
i do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for look you how he writes
“john falstaff knight ” every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those that are kin to the king for they never prick their finger but they say “there’s some of the king’s blood spilt ” “how comes that ” says he that takes upon him not to conceive
the answer is as ready as a borrower’s cap “i am the king’s poor cousin sir ” prince
nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from japhet
but to the letter “sir john falstaff knight to the son of the king nearest his father harry prince of wales greeting ” poins
“i will imitate the honourable romans in brevity ” poins
he sure means brevity in breath short winded
“i commend me to thee i commend thee and i leave thee
be not too familiar with poins for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister nell
repent at idle times as thou mayst and so farewell
thine by yea and no which is as much as to say as thou usest him—jack falstaff with my familiars john with my brothers and sisters and sir john with all europe ” poins
my lord i’ll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it
that’s to make him eat twenty of his words
but do you use me thus ned
god send the wench no worse fortune
well thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us
is your master here in london
doth the old boar feed in the old frank
at the old place my lord in eastcheap
ephesians my lord of the old church
none my lord but old mistress quickly and mistress doll tearsheet
a proper gentlewoman sir and a kinswoman of my master’s
even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull
shall we steal upon them ned at supper
i am your shadow my lord i’ll follow you
sirrah you boy and bardolph no word to your master that i am yet come to town
and for mine sir i will govern it
exeunt bardolph and page this doll tearsheet should be some road
i warrant you as common as the way between saint albans and london
how might we see falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colours and not ourselves be seen
put on two leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon him at his table as drawers
from a god to a bull
from a prince to a ’prentice
a low transformation that shall be mine for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly
enter northumberland lady northumberland and lady percy
i pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter give even way unto my rough affairs put not you on the visage of the times and be like them to percy troublesome
i have given over i will speak no more
do what you will your wisdom be your guide
alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn and but my going nothing can redeem it
o yet for god’s sake go not to these wars
the time was father that you broke your word when you were more endear’d to it than now when your own percy when my heart’s dear harry threw many a northward look to see his father bring up his powers but he did long in vain
who then persuaded you to stay at home
there were two honours lost yours and your son’s
for yours the god of heaven brighten it
for his it stuck upon him as the sun in the grey vault of heaven and by his light did all the chivalry of england move to do brave acts
he was indeed the glass wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
he had no legs that practis’d not his gait and speaking thick which nature made his blemish became the accents of the valiant for those who could speak low and tardily would turn their own perfection to abuse to seem like him
so that in speech in gait in diet in affections of delight in military rules humours of blood he was the mark and glass copy and book that fashion’d others
o miracle of men —him did you leave second to none unseconded by you to look upon the hideous god of war in disadvantage to abide a field where nothing but the sound of hotspur’s name did seem defensible so you left him
never o never do his ghost the wrong to hold your honour more precise and nice with others than with him
the marshal and the archbishop are strong had my sweet harry had but half their numbers today might i hanging on hotspur’s neck have talk’d of monmouth’s grave
beshrew your heart fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me with new lamenting ancient oversights
but i must go and meet with danger there or it will seek me in another place and find me worse provided
o fly to scotland till that the nobles and the armed commons have of their puissance made a little taste
if they get ground and vantage of the king then join you with them like a rib of steel to make strength stronger but for all our loves first let them try themselves
so did your son he was so suffer’d
so came i a widow and never shall have length of life enough to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven for recordation to my noble husband
come come go in with me
’tis with my mind as with the tide swell’d up unto his height that makes a still stand running neither way
fain would i go to meet the archbishop but many thousand reasons hold me back
there am i till time and vantage crave my company
the boar’s head tavern in eastcheap
what the devil hast thou brought there—applejohns
thou knowest sir john cannot endure an applejohn
the prince once set a dish of applejohns before him and told him there were five more sir johns and putting off his hat said “i will now take my leave of these six dry round old withered knights ” it angered him to the heart
why then cover and set them down and see if thou canst find out sneak’s noise
mistress tearsheet would fain hear some music
the room where they supped is too hot they’ll come in straight
sirrah here will be the prince and master poins anon and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons and sir john must not know of it
by the mass here will be old utis
it will be an excellent stratagem
i’ll see if i can find out sneak
exit enter hostess and doll tearsheet
i’ faith sweetheart methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality
your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire and your colour i warrant you is as red as any rose in good truth la
but i’ faith you have drunk too much canaries and that’s a marvellous searching wine and it perfumes the blood ere one can say “what’s this ” how do you now
“when arthur first in court”—empty the jordan
“and was a worthy king ” how now mistress doll
sick of a calm yea good faith
so is all her sect an they be once in a calm they are sick
a pox damn you you muddy rascal is that all the comfort you give me

we catch of you grant that my poor virtue grant that
yea joy our chains and our jewels
“your brooches pearls and ouches ”—for to serve bravely is to come halting off you know to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely and to surgery bravely to venture upon the charged chambers bravely— doll
hang yourself you muddy conger hang yourself
by my troth this is the old fashion you two never meet but you fall to some discord
you are both i’ good truth as rheumatic as two dry toasts
you cannot one bear with another’s confirmities
one must bear and that must be you
you are the weaker vessel as as they say the emptier vessel
can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead
there’s a whole merchant’s venture of bourdeaux stuff in him you have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the hold
come i’ll be friends with thee jack
thou art going to the wars and whether i shall ever see thee again or no there is nobody cares
sir ancient pistol’s below and would speak with you

“for ” says he “you are an honest woman and well thought on
therefore take heed what guests you receive
receive ” says he “no swaggering companions ” there comes none here
you would bless you to hear what he said
he’s no swaggerer hostess a tame cheater i’ faith you may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound
he’ll not swagger with a barbary hen if her feathers turn back in any show of resistance
i will bar no honest man my house nor no cheater but i do not love swaggering by my troth i am the worse when one says “swagger ” feel masters how i shake look you i warrant you
yea in very truth do i an ’twere an aspen leaf
here pistol i charge you with a cup of sack

discharge yourself of our company pistol
no good captain pistol not here sweet captain
thou abominable damned cheater art thou not ashamed to be called captain
an captains were of my mind they would truncheon you out for taking their names upon you before you have earned them
for tearing a poor whore’s ruff in a bawdy house
hang him rogue he lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes
god’s light these villains will make the word as odious as the word “occupy ” which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted
therefore captains had need look to’t
pray thee go down good ancient
not i i tell thee what corporal bardolph i could tear her
i’ll see her damned first to pluto’s damned lake by this hand to th’ infernal deep with erebus and tortures vile also
hold hook and line say i
good captain peesel be quiet ’tis very late i’ faith
i beseek you now aggravate your choler
shall packhorses and hollow pamper’d jades of asia which cannot go but thirty mile a day compare with caesars and with cannibals and trojant greeks
nay rather damn them with king cerberus and let the welkin roar
shall we fall foul for toys
by my troth captain these are very bitter words
this will grow to a brawl anon
o’ my word captain there’s none such here
what the good year do you think i would deny her
then feed and be fat my fair calipolis
si fortune me tormente sperato me contento fear we broadsides

give me some sack and sweetheart lie thou there
laying down his sword come we to full points here
sweet knight i kiss thy neaf
we have seen the seven stars
for god’s sake thrust him downstairs
i cannot endure such a fustian rascal
quoit him down bardolph like a shove groat shilling
nay an he do nothing but speak nothing he shall be nothing here
snatching up his sword then death rock me asleep abridge my doleful days
why then let grievous ghastly gaping wounds untwind the sisters three
i pray thee jack i pray thee do not draw
drawing and driving pistol out hostess
i’ll forswear keeping house afore i’ll be in these tirrits and frights
alas alas put up your naked weapons put up your naked weapons

methought he made a shrewd thrust at your belly
have you turned him out o’ doors
you have hurt him sir i’ th’ shoulder
ah you sweet little rogue you
alas poor ape how thou sweat’st
come let me wipe thy face
thou art as valorous as hector of troy worth five of agamemnon and ten times better than the nine worthies
i will toss the rogue in a blanket
do an thou darest for thy heart
an thou dost i’ll canvass thee between a pair of sheets
the rogue fled from me like quicksilver
i’ faith and thou followedst him like a church
thou whoreson little tidy bartholomew boar pig when wilt thou leave fighting a days and foining a nights and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven
enter behind prince henry and poins disguised as drawers
peace good doll do not speak like a death’s head do not bid me remember mine end
sirrah what humour ’s the prince of
a good shallow young fellow he would have made a good pantler he would ha’ chipped bread well
they say poins has a good wit
his wit’s as thick as tewksbury mustard there’s no more conceit in him than is in a mallet
why does the prince love him so then
because their legs are both of a bigness and he plays at quoits well and eats conger and fennel and drinks off candles’ ends for flap dragons and rides the wild mare with the boys and jumps upon joint stools and swears with a good grace and wears his boots very smooth like unto the sign of the leg and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories and such other gambol faculties he has that show a weak mind and an able body for the which the prince admits him for the prince himself is such another
the weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois
would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off
let’s beat him before his whore
look whe’er the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot
is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance
saturn and venus this year in conjunction
what says th’ almanac to that
and look whether the fiery trigon his man be not lisping to his master’s old tables his note book his counsel keeper
thou dost give me flattering busses
by my troth i kiss thee with a most constant heart
i am old i am old
i love thee better than i love e’er a scurvy young boy of them all
what stuff wilt have a kirtle of
i shall receive money o’ thursday shalt have a cap tomorrow
come it grows late we’ll to bed
thou’lt forget me when i am gone
by my troth thou’lt set me a weeping an thou sayest so
prove that ever i dress myself handsome till thy return
a bastard son of the king’s
and art thou not poins his brother
why thou globe of sinful continents what a life dost thou lead
i am a gentleman thou art a drawer
very true sir and i come to draw you out by the ears
o the lord preserve thy grace
by my troth welcome to london
now the lord bless that sweet face of thine
o jesu are you come from wales
thou whoreson mad compound of majesty by this light flesh and corrupt blood thou art welcome
you fat fool i scorn you
my lord he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment if you take not the heat
you whoreson candle mine you how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest virtuous civil gentlewoman
god’s blessing of your good heart
and so she is by my troth
yea and you knew me as you did when you ran away by gad’s hill
you knew i was at your back and spoke it on purpose to try my patience
no no no not so i did not think thou wast within hearing
i shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse and then i know how to handle you
no abuse hal o’ mine honour no abuse
not to dispraise me and call me pantler and bread chipper and i know not what
no abuse ned i’ th’ world honest ned none
i dispraised him before the wicked that the wicked might not fall in love with thee in which doing i have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject and thy father is to give me thanks for it
no abuse hal none ned none no faith boys none
see now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us
is thine hostess here of the wicked
or is thy boy of the wicked
or honest bardolph whose zeal burns in his nose of the wicked
the fiend hath pricked down bardolph irrecoverable and his face is lucifer’s privy kitchen where he doth nothing but roast malt worms
for the boy there is a good angel about him but the devil outbids him too
for one of them she’s in hell already and burns poor souls
for th’ other i owe her money and whether she be damned for that i know not
no i think thou art not i think thou art quit for that
marry there is another indictment upon thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house contrary to the law for the which i think thou wilt howl
what’s a joint of mutton or two in a whole lent
his grace says that which his flesh rebels against
who knocks so loud at door
look to th’ door there francis
the king your father is at westminster and there are twenty weak and wearied posts come from the north and as i came along i met and overtook a dozen captains bareheaded sweating knocking at the taverns and asking everyone for sir john falstaff
by heaven poins i feel me much to blame so idly to profane the precious time when tempest of commotion like the south borne with black vapour doth begin to melt and drop upon our bare unarmed heads
give me my sword and cloak
exeunt prince poins peto and bardolph falstaff
now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night and we must hence and leave it unpicked
you must away to court sir presently
a dozen captains stay at door for you
you see my good wenches how men of merit are sought after
the undeserver may sleep when the man of action is called on
if i be not sent away post i will see you again ere i go
i cannot speak if my heart be not ready to burst—well sweet jack have a care of thyself
i have known thee these twenty nine years come peascod time but an honester and truer hearted man—well fare thee well
bid mistress tearsheet come to my master
o run doll run run good doll come
exeunt act iii scene i westminster
enter the king in his nightgown with a page
go call the earls of surrey and of warwick but ere they come bid them o’er read these letters and well consider of them
exit page how many thousands of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep
o sleep o gentle sleep nature’s soft nurse how have i frighted thee that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness
why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching thee and hushed with buzzing night flies to thy slumber than in the perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lull’d with sound of sweetest melody
o thou dull god why liest thou with the vile in loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch a watch case or a common ’larum bell
wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the ship boy’s eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious surge and in the visitation of the winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafing clamour in the slippery clouds that with the hurly death itself awakes
canst thou o partial sleep give thy repose to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude and in the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot deny it to a king
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
many good morrows to your majesty
why then good morrow to you all my lords
have you read o’er the letters that i sent you
then you perceive the body of our kingdom how foul it is what rank diseases grow and with what danger near the heart of it
it is but as a body yet distemper’d which to his former strength may be restored with good advice and little medicine
my lord northumberland will soon be cool’d
o god that one might read the book of fate and see the revolution of the times make mountains level and the continent weary of solid firmness melt itself into the sea and other times to see the beachy girdle of the ocean too wide for neptune’s hips how chance’s mocks and changes fill the cup of alteration with divers liquors
o if this were seen the happiest youth viewing his progress through what perils past what crosses to ensue would shut the book and sit him down and die
’tis not ten years gone since richard and northumberland great friends did feast together and in two years after were they at wars
it is but eight years since this percy was the man nearest my soul who like a brother toil’d in my affairs and laid his love and life under my foot yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard gave him defiance
but which of you was by— to warwick
you cousin nevil as i may remember— when richard with his eye brimful of tears then check’d and rated by northumberland did speak these words now proved a prophecy
“northumberland thou ladder by the which my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne” though then god knows i had no such intent but that necessity so bow’d the state that i and greatness were compell’d to kiss— “the time shall come ” thus did he follow it “the time will come that foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption”—so went on foretelling this same time’s condition and the division of our amity
there is a history in all men’s lives figuring the natures of the times deceased the which observed a man may prophesy with a near aim of the main chance of things as yet not come to life who in their seeds and weak beginning lie intreasured
such things become the hatch and brood of time and by the necessary form of this king richard might create a perfect guess that great northumberland then false to him would of that seed grow to a greater falseness which should not find a ground to root upon unless on you
then let us meet them like necessities and that same word even now cries out on us
they say the bishop and northumberland are fifty thousand strong
rumour doth double like the voice and echo the numbers of the feared
please it your grace to go to bed
upon my soul my lord the powers that you already have sent forth shall bring this prize in very easily
to comfort you the more i have received a certain instance that glendower is dead
your majesty hath been this fortnight ill and these unseason’d hours perforce must add unto your sickness
and were these inward wars once out of hand we would dear lords unto the holy land
enter shallow and silence meeting mouldy shadow wart feeble bullcalf a servant or two with them
come on come on come on
give me your hand sir give me your hand sir
an early stirrer by the rood
and how doth my good cousin silence
and how doth my cousin your bedfellow
and your fairest daughter and mine my god daughter ellen
alas a black ousel cousin shallow
by yea and no sir i dare say my cousin william is become a good scholar
he is at oxford still is he not
he must then to the inns o’ court shortly
i was once of clement’s inn where i think they will talk of mad shallow yet
you were called “lusty shallow” then cousin
by the mass i was called anything and i would have done anything indeed too and roundly too
there was i and little john doit of staffordshire and black george barnes and francis pickbone and will squele a cotswold man
you had not four such swinge bucklers in all the inns o’ court again
and i may say to you we knew where the bona robas were and had the best of them all at commandment
then was jack falstaff now sir john a boy and page to thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
this sir john cousin that comes hither anon about soldiers
the same sir john the very same
i see him break scoggin’s head at the court gate when he was a crack not thus high and the very same day did i fight with one sampson stockfish a fruiterer behind gray’s inn
jesu jesu the mad days that i have spent
and to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead
certain ’tis certain very sure very sure
death as the psalmist saith is certain to all all shall die
how a good yoke of bullocks at stamford fair
by my troth i was not there
is old double of your town living yet
he drew a good bow and dead
john a gaunt loved him well and betted much money on his head
he would have clapped i’ th’ clout at twelve score and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half that it would have done a man’s heart good to see
how a score of ewes now
thereafter as they be a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds
here come two of sir john falstaffs men as i think
enter bardolph and one with him
i beseech you which is justice shallow
i am robert shallow sir a poor esquire of this county and one of the king’s justices of the peace
what is your good pleasure with me
my captain sir commends him to you my captain sir john falstaff a tall gentleman by heaven and a most gallant leader
i knew him a good backsword man
may i ask how my lady his wife doth
a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife
it is well said in faith sir and it is well said indeed too
“better accommodated ” it is good yea indeed is it
good phrases are surely and ever were very commendable
“accommodated ” it comes of accommodo
pardon sir i have heard the word—phrase call you it
by this day i know not the phrase but i will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier like word and a word of exceeding good command by heaven
accommodated that is when a man is as they say accommodated or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be accommodated which is an excellent thing
look here comes good sir john
give me your good hand give me your worship’s good hand
by my troth you like well and bear your years very well
i am glad to see you well good master robert shallow
no sir john it is my cousin silence in commission with me
good master silence it well befits you should be of the peace
fie this is hot weather gentlemen
have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men
let me see them i beseech you
let me see let me see let me see
so so so so so so so
let them appear as i call let them do so let them do so
let me see where is mouldy
a good limbed fellow young strong and of good friends
’tis the more time thou wert used
things that are mouldy lack use
very singular good in faith well said sir john very well said
i was pricked well enough before an you could have let me alone
my old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery
you need not to have pricked me there are other men fitter to go out than i falstaff
mouldy it is time you were spent
yea marry let me have him to sit under
he’s like to be a cold soldier
like enough and thy father’s shadow
so the son of the female is the shadow of the male
it is often so indeed but much of the father’s substance
do you like him sir john
prick him for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster book
thou art a very ragged wart
shall i prick him sir john
it were superfluous for his apparel is built upon his back and the whole frame stands upon pins
you can do it sir you can do it
you may but if he had been a man’s tailor he’d ha’ pricked you
wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy’s battle as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat
i will do my good will sir you can have no more
thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse

so very well go to very good exceeding good
o give me always a little lean old chopt bald shot
hold there’s a tester for thee
he is not his craft’s master he doth not do it right
i remember at mile end green when i lay at clement’s inn—i was then sir dagonet in arthur’s show—there was a little quiver fellow and he would manage you his piece thus
and he would about and about and come you in and come you in
“rah tah tah ” would he say
“bounce” would he say and away again would he go and again would he come
i shall ne’er see such a fellow
god keep you master silence i will not use many words with you

sir john the lord bless you
at your return visit our house let our old acquaintance be renewed
peradventure i will with ye to the court
fore god i would you would master shallow
go to i have spoke at a word
on bardolph lead the men away
exeunt bardolph recruits c as i return i will fetch off these justices
i do see the bottom of justice shallow
lord lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying
this same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about turnbull street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the turk’s tribute
i do remember him at clement’s inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring
when he was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife
he was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible
he was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores called him mandrake
he came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his good nights
and now is this vice’s dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of john a gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and i’ll be sworn he ne’er saw him but once in the tilt yard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal’s men
i saw it and told john a gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court
and now has he land and beefs
well i’ll be acquainted with him if i return and ’t shall go hard but i’ll make him a philosopher’s two stones to me
if the young dace be a bait for the old pike i see no reason in the law of nature but i may snap at him
let time shape and there an end
exit act iv scene i yorkshire
enter the archbishop of york mowbray hastings and others
’tis gaultree forest an ’t shall please your grace
here stand my lords and send discoverers forth to know the numbers of our enemies
my friends and brethren in these great affairs i must acquaint you that i have received new dated letters from northumberland their cold intent tenor and substance thus here doth he wish his person with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality the which he could not levy whereupon he is retired to ripe his growing fortunes to scotland and concludes in hearty prayers that your attempts may overlive the hazard and fearful meeting of their opposite
thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground and dash themselves to pieces
west of this forest scarcely off a mile in goodly form comes on the enemy and by the ground they hide i judge their number upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
the just proportion that we gave them out
let us sway on and face them in the field
what well appointed leader fronts us here
i think it is my lord of westmoreland
health and fair greeting from our general the prince lord john and duke of lancaster
say on my lord of westmoreland in peace what doth concern your coming
then my lord unto your grace do i in chief address the substance of my speech
if that rebellion came like itself in base and abject routs led on by bloody youth guarded with rags and countenanced by boys and beggary i say if damn’d commotion so appear’d in his true native and most proper shape you reverend father and these noble lords had not been here to dress the ugly form of base and bloody insurrection with your fair honours
you lord archbishop whose see is by a civil peace maintain’d whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch’d whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor’d whose white investments figure innocence the dove and very blessed spirit of peace wherefore you do so ill translate yourself out of the speech of peace that bears such grace into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war turning your books to graves your ink to blood your pens to lances and your tongue divine to a loud trumpet and a point of war
briefly to this end we are all diseased and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died
but my most noble lord of westmoreland i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop our very veins of life
i have in equal balance justly weigh’d what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offences
we see which way the stream of time doth run and are enforced from our most quiet there by the rough torrent of occasion and have the summary of all our griefs when time shall serve to show in articles which long ere this we offer’d to the king and might by no suit gain our audience
when we are wrong’d and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong
the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minute’s instance present now hath put us in these ill beseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality
whenever yet was your appeal denied
wherein have you been galled by the king
what peer hath been suborn’d to grate on you that you should seal this lawless bloody book of forged rebellion with a seal divine and consecrate commotion’s bitter edge
my brother general the commonwealth to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular
there is no need of any such redress or if there were it not belongs to you
why not to him in part and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before and suffer the condition of these times to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honours
o my good lord mowbray construe the times to their necessities and you shall say indeed it is the time and not the king that doth you injuries
yet for your part it not appears to me either from the king or in the present time that you should have an inch of any ground to build a grief on
were you not restored to all the duke of norfolk’s signories your noble and right well rememb’red father’s
what thing in honour had my father lost that need to be revived and breathed in me
you speak lord mowbray now you know not what
the earl of hereford was reputed then in england the most valiant gentleman
who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled
but if your father had been victor there he ne’er had borne it out of coventry for all the country in a general voice cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love were set on hereford whom they doted on and bless’d and graced indeed more than the king
but this is mere digression from my purpose
here come i from our princely general to know your griefs to tell you from his grace that he will give you audience and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just you shall enjoy them everything set off that might so much as think you enemies
but he hath forc’d us to compel this offer and it proceeds from policy not love
mowbray you overween to take it so this offer comes from mercy not from fear
for lo within a ken our army lies upon mine honour all too confident to give admittance to a thought of fear
our battle is more full of names than yours our men more perfect in the use of arms our armour all as strong our cause the best then reason will our hearts should be as good
say you not then our offer is compell’d
well by my will we shall admit no parley
that argues but the shame of your offence a rotten case abides no handling
hath the prince john a full commission in very ample virtue of his father to hear and absolutely to determine of what conditions we shall stand upon
that is intended in the general’s name i muse you make so slight a question
then take my lord of westmoreland this schedule for this contains our general grievances
each several article herein redress’d all members of our cause both here and hence that are insinew’d to this action acquitted by a true substantial form and present execution of our wills to us and to our purposes confined we come within our awful banks again and knit our powers to the arm of peace
this will i show the general
please you lords in sight of both our battles we may meet and either end in peace which god so frame
or to the place of difference call the swords which must decide it
my lord we will do so
there is a thing within my bosom tells me that no conditions of our peace can stand
fear you not that if we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute as our conditions shall consist upon our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
yea but our valuation shall be such that every slight and false derived cause yea every idle nice and wanton reason shall to the king taste of this action that were our royal faiths martyrs in love we shall be winnow’d with so rough a wind that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff and good from bad find no partition
note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no tell tale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembrance
for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion
his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend
so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was uprear’d to execution
besides the king hath wasted all his rods on late offenders that he now doth lack the very instruments of chastisement so that his power like to a fangless lion may offer but not hold
’tis very true and therefore be assured my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking
here is return’d my lord of westmoreland
the prince is here at hand
pleaseth your lordship to meet his grace just distance ’tween our armies
your grace of york in god’s name then set forward
enter from one side mowbray attended afterwards the archbishop hastings and others from the other side prince john of lancaster and westmoreland officers and others with them
you are well encounter’d here my cousin mowbray
good day to you gentle lord archbishop and so to you lord hastings and to all
my lord of york it better show’d with you when that your flock assembled by the bell encircled you to hear with reverence your exposition on the holy text than now to see you here an iron man cheering a rout of rebels with your drum turning the word to sword and life to death
that man that sits within a monarch’s heart and ripens in the sunshine of his favour would he abuse the countenance of the king alack what mischiefs might he set abroach in shadow of such greatness
with you lord bishop it is even so
who hath not heard it spoken how deep you were within the books of god to us the speaker in his parliament to us th’ imagined voice of god himself the very opener and intelligencer between the grace the sanctities of heaven and our dull workings
o who shall believe but you misuse the reverence of your place employ the countenance and grace of heaven as a false favourite doth his prince’s name in deeds dishonourable
you have ta’en up under the counterfeited zeal of god the subjects of his substitute my father and both against the peace of heaven and him have here up swarm’d them
good my lord of lancaster i am not here against your father’s peace but as i told my lord of westmoreland the time misorder’d doth in common sense crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form to hold our safety up
i sent your grace the parcels and particulars of our grief the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court whereon this hydra son of war is born whose dangerous eyes may well be charm’d asleep with grant of our most just and right desires and true obedience of this madness cured stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
if not we ready are to try our fortunes to the last man
and though we here fall down we have supplies to second our attempt if they miscarry theirs shall second them and so success of mischief shall be born and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up whiles england shall have generation
you are too shallow hastings much to shallow to sound the bottom of the after times
pleaseth your grace to answer them directly how far forth you do like their articles
i like them all and do allow them well and swear here by the honour of my blood my father’s purposes have been mistook and some about him have too lavishly wrested his meaning and authority
my lord these griefs shall be with speed redress’d upon my soul they shall
if this may please you discharge your powers unto their several counties as we will ours and here between the armies let’s drink together friendly and embrace that all their eyes may bear those tokens home of our restored love and amity
i take your princely word for these redresses
i give it you and will maintain my word and thereupon i drink unto your grace
go captain and deliver to the army this news of peace
let them have pay and part
i know it will please them
to you my noble lord of westmoreland
i pledge your grace and if you knew what pains i have bestow’d to breed this present peace you would drink freely but my love to ye shall show itself more openly hereafter
health to my lord and gentle cousin mowbray
you wish me health in very happy season for i am on the sudden something ill archbishop
against ill chances men are ever merry but heaviness foreruns the good event
therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow serves to say thus “some good thing comes tomorrow ” archbishop
believe me i am passing light in spirit
so much the worse if your own rule be true
the word of peace is render’d
this had been cheerful after victory
a peace is of the nature of a conquest for then both parties nobly are subdued and neither party loser
and let our army be discharged too
exit westmoreland and good my lord so please you let our trains march by us that we may peruse the men we should have coped withal
go good lord hastings and ere they be dismiss’d let them march by
i trust lords we shall lie tonight together
now cousin wherefore stands our army still
the leaders having charge from you to stand will not go off until they hear you speak
my lord our army is dispersed already
like youthful steers unyoked they take their courses east west north south or like a school broke up each hurries toward his home and sporting place
good tidings my lord hastings for the which i do arrest thee traitor of high treason and you lord archbishop and you lord mowbray of capital treason i attach you both
is this proceeding just and honourable
will you thus break your faith
i promised you redress of these same grievances whereof you did complain which by mine honour i will perform with a most christian care
but for you rebels look to taste the due meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
most shallowly did you these arms commence fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
strike up our drums pursue the scattr’d stray god and not we hath safely fought today
some guard these traitors to the block of death treason’s true bed and yielder up of breath
of what condition are you and of what place i pray
i am a knight sir and my name is colevile of the dale
well then colevile is your name a knight is your degree and your place the dale
colevile shall be still your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place a place deep enough so shall you be still colevile of the dale
are not you sir john falstaff
as good a man as he sir whoe’er i am
do ye yield sir or shall i sweat for you
if i do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death
therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy
i think you are sir john falstaff and in that thought yield me
i have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name
an i had but a belly of any indifferency i were simply the most active fellow in europe
my womb my womb my womb undoes me
enter prince john of lancaster westmoreland blunt and others
the heat is past follow no further now
call in the powers good cousin westmoreland
exit westmoreland now falstaff where have you been all this while
when everything is ended then you come
these tardy tricks of yours will on my life one time or other break some gallows’ back
i would be sorry my lord but it should be thus
i never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour
do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet
have i in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought
i have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility i have foundered nine score and odd posts and here travel tainted as i am have in my pure and immaculate valour taken sir john colevile of the dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy
he saw me and yielded that i may justly say with the hook nosed fellow of rome “i came saw and overcame ” lancaster
it was more of his courtesy than your deserving
here he is and here i yield him
and i beseech your grace let it be booked with the rest of this day’s deeds or by the lord i will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on’t colevile kissing my foot to the which course if i be enforced if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and i in the clear sky of fame o’ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins’ heads to her believe not the word of the noble
therefore let me have right and let desert mount
let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will
a famous rebel art thou colevile
and a famous true subject took him
i am my lord but as my betters are that led me hither
had they been ruled by me you should have won them dearer than you have
i know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and i thank thee for thee
retreat is made and execution stay’d
send colevile with his confederates to york to present execution
blunt lead him hence and see you guard him sure
exeunt blunt and others with colevile and now dispatch we toward the court my lords
i hear the king my father is sore sick
our news shall go before us to his majesty which cousin you shall bear to comfort him and we with sober speed will follow you
my lord i beseech you give me leave to go through gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report
i in my condition shall better speak of you than you deserve
i would you had but the wit ’twere better than your dukedom
good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that’s no marvel he drinks no wine
there’s never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so over cool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches
they are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation
a good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it
it ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o’er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit
the second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice
but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts’ extremes
it illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris
so that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use
hereof comes it that prince harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant
if i had a thousand sons the first humane principle i would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack
the army is discharged all and gone
i’ll through gloucestershire and there will i visit master robert shallow esquire
i have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb and shortly will i seal with him
enter the king warwick thomas duke of clarence and humphrey duke of gloucester and others
now lords if god doth give successful end to this debate that bleedeth at our doors we will our youth lead on to higher fields and draw no swords but what are sanctified
our navy is address’d our power collected our substitutes in absence well invested and everything lies level to our wish
only we want a little personal strength and pause us till these rebels now afoot come underneath the yoke of government
both which we doubt not but your majesty shall soon enjoy
humphrey my son of gloucester where is the prince your brother
i think he’s gone to hunt my lord at windsor
i do not know my lord
is not his brother thomas of clarence with him
no my good lord he is in presence here
what would my lord and father
nothing but well to thee thomas of clarence
how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother
he loves thee and thou dost neglect him thomas
thou hast a better place in his affection than all thy brothers
cherish it my boy and noble offices thou mayst effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren
therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observed he hath a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensed he’s flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws congealed in the spring of day
his temper therefore must be well observed
chide him for faults and do it reverently when you perceive his blood inclined to mirth but being moody give him time and scope till that his passions like a whale on ground confound themselves with working
learn this thomas and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in that the united vessel of their blood mingled with venom of suggestion— as force perforce the age will pour it in— shall never leak though it do work as strong as aconitum or rash gunpowder
i shall observe him with all care and love
why art thou not at windsor with him thomas
he is not there today he dines in london
with poins and other his continual followers
most subject is the fattest soil to weeds and he the noble image of my youth is overspread with them therefore my grief stretches itself beyond the hour of death
the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape in forms imaginary th’ unguided days and rotten times that you shall look upon when i am sleeping with my ancestors
for when his headstrong riot hath no curb when rage and hot blood are his counsellors when means and lavish manners meet together o with what wings shall his affections fly towards fronting peril and opposed decay
my gracious lord you look beyond him quite
the prince but studies his companions like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language ’tis needful that the most immodest word be looked upon and learned which once attained your highness knows comes to no further use but to be known and hated
so like gross terms the prince will in the perfectness of time cast off his followers and their memory shall as a pattern or a measure live by which his grace must mete the lives of other turning past evils to advantages
’tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb in the dead carrion
health to my sovereign and new happiness added to that that i am to deliver
prince john your son doth kiss your grace’s hand
mowbray the bishop scroop hastings and all are brought to the correction of your law
there is not now a rebel’s sword unsheathed but peace puts forth her olive everywhere
the manner how this action hath been borne here at more leisure may your highness read with every course in his particular
o westmoreland thou art a summer bird which ever in the haunch of winter sings the lifting up of day
from enemies heaven keep your majesty and when they stand against you may they fall as those that i am come to tell you of
the earl northumberland and the lord bardolph with a great power of english and of scots are by the shrieve of yorkshire overthrown
the manner and true order of the fight this packet please it you contains at large
and wherefore should these good news make me sick
will fortune never come with both hands full but write her fair words still in foulest letters
she either gives a stomach and no food— such are the poor in health or else a feast and takes away the stomach—such are the rich that have abundance and enjoy it not
i should rejoice now at this happy news and now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
come near me now i am much ill gloucester
my sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
be patient princes you do know these fits are with his highness very ordinary
stand from him give him air he’ll straight be well
no no he cannot long hold out these pangs
th’ incessant care and labour of his mind hath wrought the mure that should confine it in so thin that life looks through and will break out
the people fear me for they do observe unfather’d heirs and loathly births of nature
the seasons change their manners as the year had found some months asleep and leap’d them over
the river hath thrice flow’d no ebb between and the old folk time’s doting chronicles say it did so a little time before that our great grandsire edward sick’d and died
speak lower princes for the king recovers
this apoplexy will certain be his end
i pray you take me up and bear me hence into some other chamber softly pray
the king lying on a bed
clarence gloucester warwick and others in attendance
let there be no noise made my gentle friends unless some dull and favourable hand will whisper music to my weary spirit
call for the music in the other room
set me the crown upon my pillow here
his eye is hollow and he changes much
who saw the duke of clarence
i am here brother full of heaviness
how now rain within doors and none abroad
heard he the good news yet
he alt’red much upon the hearing it
if he be sick with joy he’ll recover without physic
not so much noise my lords
sweet prince speak low the king your father is disposed to sleep
let us withdraw into the other room
will’t please your grace to go along with us
no i will sit and watch here by the king
exeunt all but the prince why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow being so troublesome a bedfellow
that keep’st the ports of slumber open wide to many a watchful night
sleep with it now yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet as he whose brow with homely biggen bound snores out the watch of night
when thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit like a rich armour worn in heat of day that scald’st with safety
by his gates of breath there lies a downy feather which stirs not did he suspire that light and weightless down perforce must move
this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep that from this golden rigol hath divorced so many english kings
thy due from me is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood which nature love and filial tenderness shall o dear father pay thee plenteously
my due from thee is this imperial crown which as immediate from thy place and blood derives itself to me
lo where it sits which god shall guard and put the world’s whole strength into one giant arm it shall not force this lineal honour from me
this from thee will i to mine leave as ’tis left to me
enter warwick gloucester clarence and the rest
why did you leave me here alone my lords
we left the prince my brother here my liege who undertook to sit and watch by you
this door is open he is gone this way
he came not through the chamber where we stay’d
who took it from my pillow
when we withdrew my liege we left it here
the prince hath ta’en it hence
is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death
find him my lord of warwick chide him hither
exit warwick this part of his conjoins with my disease and helps to end me
see sons what things you are how quickly nature falls into revolt when gold becomes her object
for this the foolish over careful fathers have broke their sleep with thoughts their brains with care their bones with industry for this they have engrossed and piled up the canker’d heaps of strange achieved gold for this they have been thoughtful to invest their sons with arts and martial exercises when like the bee tolling from every flower the virtuous sweets our thighs pack’d with wax our mouths with honey we bring it to the hive and like the bees are murdered for our pains
this bitter taste yields his engrossments to the ending father
now where is he that will not stay so long till his friend sickness hath determin’d me
my lord i found the prince in the next room washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks with such a deep demeanour in great sorrow that tyranny which never quaff’d but blood would by beholding him have wash’d his knife with gentle eye drops
but wherefore did he take away the crown
depart the chamber leave us here alone
exeunt warwick and the rest prince
i never thought to hear you speak again
thy wish was father harry to that thought
i stay too long by thee i weary thee
dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours before thy hour be ripe
thou seek’st the greatness that will overwhelm thee
stay but a little for my cloud of dignity is held from falling with so weak a wind that it will quickly drop
thou hast stolen that which after some few hours were thine without offence and at my death thou hast seal’d up my expectation
thy life did manifest thou loved’st me not and thou wilt have me die assured of it
thou hid’st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart to stab at half an hour of my life
what canst thou not forbear me half an hour
then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear that thou art crowned not that i am dead
let all the tears that should bedew my hearse be drops of balm to sanctify thy head only compound me with forgotten dust
give that which gave thee life unto the worms
pluck down my officers break my decrees for now a time is come to mock at form
and to the english court assemble now from every region apes of idleness
now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance revel the night rob murder and commit the oldest sins the newest kind of ways
be happy he will trouble you no more
england shall double gild his treble guilt england shall give him office honour might for the fifth harry from curb’d license plucks the muzzle of restraint and the wild dog shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
o my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
when that my care could not withhold thy riots what wilt thou do when riot is thy care
o thou wilt be a wilderness again peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
but for my tears the moist impediments unto my speech i had forestall’d this dear and deep rebuke ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard the course of it so far
there is your crown and he that wears the crown immortally long guard it yours
if i affect it more than as your honour and as your renown let me no more from this obedience rise which my most inward true and duteous spirit teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
god witness with me when i here came in and found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart
if i do feign o let me in my present wildness die and never live to show th’ incredulous world the noble change that i have purposed
coming to look on you thinking you dead and dead almost my liege to think you were i spake unto this crown as having sense and thus upbraided it “the care on thee depending hath fed upon the body of my father therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
other less fine in carat is more precious preserving life in med’cine potable but thou most fine most honour’d most renown’d hast eat thy bearer up ” thus my most royal liege accusing it i put it on my head to try with it as with an enemy that had before my face murder’d my father the quarrel of a true inheritor
but if it did infect my blood with joy or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride if any rebel or vain spirit of mine did with the least affection of a welcome give entertainment to the might of it let god for ever keep it from my head and make me as the poorest vassal is that doth with awe and terror kneel to it
o my son god put it in thy mind to take it hence that thou mightst win the more thy father’s love pleading so wisely in excuse of it
come hither harry sit thou by my bed and hear i think the very latest counsel that ever i shall breathe
god knows my son by what by paths and indirect crook’d ways i met this crown and i myself know well how troublesome it sat upon my head
to thee it shall descend with better quiet better opinion better confirmation for all the soil of the achievement goes with me into the earth
it seem’d in me but as an honour snatch’d with boisterous hand and i had many living to upbraid my gain of it by their assistances which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed wounding supposed peace
all these bold fears thou seest with peril i have answered for all my reign hath been but as a scene acting that argument
and now my death changes the mood for what in me was purchased falls upon thee in a more fairer sort so thou the garland wear’st successively
yet though thou stand’st more sure than i could do thou art not firm enough since griefs are green and all my friends which thou must make thy friends have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out by whose fell working i was first advanced and by whose power i well might lodge a fear to be again displaced which to avoid i cut them off and had a purpose now to lead out many to the holy land lest rest and lying still might make them look too near unto my state
therefore my harry be it thy course to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels that action hence borne out may waste the memory of the former days
more would i but my lungs are wasted so that strength of speech is utterly denied me
how i came by the crown o god forgive and grant it may with thee in true peace live
my gracious liege you won it wore it kept it gave it me then plain and right must my possession be which i with more than with a common pain ’gainst all the world will rightfully maintain

their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese
if i had a suit to master shallow i would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men i would curry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants
it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another
therefore let men take heed of their company
i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and he shall laugh without intervallums

o good my lord you have lost a friend indeed and i dare swear you borrow not that face of seeming sorrow it is sure your own
though no man be assured what grace to find you stand in coldest expectation
i am the sorrier would ’twere otherwise
well you must now speak sir john falstaff fair which swims against your stream of quality
sweet princes what i did i did in honour led by th’ impartial conduct of my soul and never shall you see that i will beg a ragged and forestall’d remission

enter king henry the fifth attended
good morrow and god save your majesty
this new and gorgeous garment majesty sits not so easy on me as you think
brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
this is the english not the turkish court not amurath an amurath succeeds but harry harry
yet be sad good brothers for by my faith it very well becomes you
sorrow so royally in you appears that i will deeply put the fashion on and wear it in my heart
why then be sad but entertain no more of it good brothers than a joint burden laid upon us all
for me by heaven i bid you be assured i’ll be your father and your brother too let me but bear your love i’ll bear your cares
yet weep that harry’s dead and so will i but harry lives that shall convert those tears by number into hours of happiness
we hope no otherwise from your majesty
you all look strangely on me
and you most you are i think assured i love you not
i am assured if i be measured rightly your majesty hath no just cause to hate me
how might a prince of my great hopes forget so great indignities you laid upon me
rate rebuke and roughly send to prison th’ immediate heir of england
may this be wash’d in lethe and forgotten
i then did use the person of your father the image of his power lay then in me and in the administration of his law whiles i was busy for the commonwealth your highness pleased to forget my place the majesty and power of law and justice the image of the king whom i presented and struck me in my very seat of judgement whereon as an offender to your father i gave bold way to my authority and did commit you
if the deed were ill be you contented wearing now the garland to have a son set your decrees at nought
to pluck down justice from your awful bench
to trip the course of law and blunt the sword that guards the peace and safety of your person
nay more to spurn at your most royal image and mock your workings in a second body
question your royal thoughts make the case yours be now the father and propose a son hear your own dignity so much profaned see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted behold yourself so by a son disdain’d and then imagine me taking your part and in your power soft silencing your son
after this cold considerance sentence me and as you are a king speak in your state what i have done that misbecame my place my person or my liege’s sovereignty
you are right justice and you weigh this well
therefore still bear the balance and the sword
and i do wish your honours may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did
so shall i live to speak my father’s words “happy am i that have a man so bold that dares do justice on my proper son and not less happy having such a son that would deliver up his greatness so into the hands of justice ” you did commit me for which i do commit into your hand th’ unstained sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with the like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done ’gainst me
you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your well practised wise directions
and princes all believe me i beseech you my father is gone wild into his grave for in his tomb lie my affections and with his spirit sadly i survive to mock the expectation of the world to frustrate prophecies and to raze out rotten opinion who hath writ me down after my seeming
the tide of blood in me hath proudly flow’d in vanity till now
now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea where it shall mingle with the state of floods and flow henceforth in formal majesty
now call we our high court of parliament and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel that the great body of our state may go in equal rank with the best govern’d nation that war or peace or both at once may be as things acquainted and familiar to us in which you father shall have foremost hand
our coronation done we will accite as i before remember’d all our state and god consigning to my good intents no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say god shorten harry’s happy life one day

make less thy body hence and more thy grace leave gormandizing know the grave doth gape for thee thrice wider than for other men
reply not to me with a fool born jest
presume not that i am the thing i was for god doth know so shall the world perceive that i have turn’d away my former self so will i those that kept me company

first my fear then my curtsy last my speech
my fear is your displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your pardons
if you look for a good speech now you undo me for what i have to say is of mine own making and what indeed i should say will i doubt prove mine own marring
but to the purpose and so to the venture
be it known to you as it is very well i was lately here in the end of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better
i meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home i break and you my gentle creditors lose
here i promised you i would be and here i commit my body to your mercies
bate me some and i will pay you some and as most debtors do promise you infinitely
if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to use my legs
and yet that were but light payment to dance out of your debt
but a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction and so would i
all the gentlewomen here have forgiven me if the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly
one word more i beseech you
if you be not too much cloyed with fat meat our humble author will continue the story with sir john in it and make you merry with fair katharine of france where for anything i know falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already he be killed with your hard opinions for oldcastle died a martyr and this is not the man

exit act i scene i london
an ante chamber in the king’s palace
enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
my lord i’ll tell you that self bill is urg’d which in the eleventh year of the last king’s reign was like and had indeed against us passed but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question
but how my lord shall we resist it now
if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valu’d thus as much as would maintain to the king’s honour full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds by th’ year
’twould drink the cup and all
the king is full of grace and fair regard
and a true lover of the holy church
the courses of his youth promis’d it not
the breath no sooner left his father’s body but that his wildness mortified in him seemed to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whipped th’ offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise t’ envelope and contain celestial spirits
never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never hydra headed wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king
we are blessed in the change
the strawberry grows underneath the nettle and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best neighboured by fruit of baser quality and so the prince obscured his contemplation under the veil of wildness which no doubt grew like the summer grass fastest by night unseen yet crescive in his faculty
it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected
but my good lord how now for mitigation of this bill urged by the commons
doth his majesty incline to it or no
he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opened to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal
how did this offer seem received my lord
with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his great grandfather
what was th’ impediment that broke this off
the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing
then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it
i’ll wait upon you and i long to hear it
enter king henry gloucester bedford clarence warwick westmorland exeter and attendants
where is my gracious lord of canterbury
shall we call in th’ ambassador my liege
we would be resolved before we hear him of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france
enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely
god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it
my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim
and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to
therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war
we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint ’gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality
under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism
then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne
there is no bar to make against your highness’ claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant “no woman shall succeed in salic land ” which salic land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar
yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salic is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdu’d the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establish’d then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salic land which salic as i said ’twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany call’d meissen
then doth it well appear the salic law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salic land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly suppos’d the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdu’d the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five
besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france
hugh capet also who usurp’d the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey’d himself as the heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great
also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was re united to the crown of france
so that as clear as is the summer’s sun king pepin’s title and hugh capet’s claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female
so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp’d from you and your progenitors
may i with right and conscience make this claim
the sin upon my head dread sovereign
for in the book of numbers is it writ “when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter ” gracious lord stand for your own
look back into your mighty ancestors
go my dread lord to your great grandsire’s tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle’s edward the black prince who on the french ground play’d a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp forage in blood of french nobility
o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action
awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats
you are their heir you sit upon their throne the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege is in the very may morn of his youth ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
your brother kings and monarchs of the earth do all expect that you should rouse yourself as did the former lions of your blood
they know your grace hath cause and means and might so hath your highness
never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie pavilion’d in the fields of france
o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors
we must not only arm to invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages
they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers
we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish’d kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girdling with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood
she hath been then more fear’d than harm’d my liege for hear her but exampl’d by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward’s fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries
but there’s a saying very old and true “if that you will france win then with scotland first begin ” for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat
it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush’d necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
while that the armed hand doth fight abroad the advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts doth keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music
therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honey bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom
i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously
as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial’s centre so many a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat
divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake
if we with thrice such powers left at home cannot defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin
exeunt some attendants now are we well resolv’d and by god’s help and yours the noble sinews of our power france being ours we’ll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces
or there we’ll sit ruling in large and ample empery o’er france and all her almost kingly dukedoms or lay these bones in an unworthy urn tombless with no remembrance over them
either our history shall with full mouth speak freely of our acts or else our grave like turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth not worshipp’d with a waxen epitaph
now are we well prepar’d to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin for we hear your greeting is from him not from the king
may’t please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin’s meaning and our embassy
we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fett’red in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin’s mind
your highness lately sending into france did claim some certain dukedoms in the right of your great predecessor king edward the third
in answer of which claim the prince our master says that you savour too much of your youth and bids you be advis’d there’s nought in france that can be with a nimble galliard won
you cannot revel into dukedoms there
he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit this tun of treasure and in lieu of this desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you
we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us
his present and your pains we thank you for
when we have match’d our rackets to these balls we will in france by god’s grace play a set shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler that all the courts of france will be disturb’d with chaces
and we understand him well how he comes o’er us with our wilder days not measuring what use we made of them
we never valu’d this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as ’tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home
but tell the dauphin i will keep my state be like a king and show my sail of greatness when i do rouse me in my throne of france
for that i have laid by my majesty and plodded like a man for working days but i will rise there with so full a glory that i will dazzle all the eyes of france yea strike the dauphin blind to look on us
and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn’d his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin’s scorn
but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallow’d cause
so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it — convey them with safe conduct —fare you well
we hope to make the sender blush at it
therefore my lords omit no happy hour that may give furtherance to our expedition for we have now no thought in us but france save those to god that run before our business
therefore let our proportions for these wars be soon collected and all things thought upon that may with reasonable swiftness add more feathers to our wings for god before we’ll chide this dauphin at his father’s door
therefore let every man now task his thought that this fair action may on foot be brought
now all the youth of england are on fire and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
now thrive the armourers and honour’s thought reigns solely in the breast of every man
they sell the pasture now to buy the horse following the mirror of all christian kings with winged heels as english mercuries
for now sits expectation in the air and hides a sword from hilts unto the point with crowns imperial crowns and coronets promis’d to harry and his followers
the french advis’d by good intelligence of this most dreadful preparation shake in their fear and with pale policy seek to divert the english purposes
model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what mightst thou do that honour would thee do were all thy children kind and natural
france hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms which he fills with treacherous crowns and three corrupted men one richard earl of cambridge and the second henry lord scroop of masham and the third sir thomas grey knight of northumberland have for the gilt of france —o guilt indeed — confirm’d conspiracy with fearful france and by their hands this grace of kings must die if hell and treason hold their promises ere he take ship for france and in southampton
linger your patience on and we’ll digest the abuse of distance force a play
the sum is paid the traitors are agreed the king is set from london and the scene is now transported gentles to southampton
there is the playhouse now there must you sit and thence to france shall we convey you safe and bring you back charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass for if we may we’ll not offend one stomach with our play
but till the king come forth and not till then unto southampton do we shift our scene
enter corporal nym and lieutenant bardolph
what are ancient pistol and you friends yet
for my part i care not
i say little but when time shall serve there shall be smiles but that shall be as it may
i dare not fight but i will wink and hold out mine iron
it is a simple one but what though
it will toast cheese and it will endure cold as another man’s sword will and there’s an end
i will bestow a breakfast to make you friends and we’ll be all three sworn brothers to france
let it be so good corporal nym
faith i will live so long as i may that’s the certain of it and when i cannot live any longer i will do as i may
that is my rest that is the rendezvous of it
it is certain corporal that he is married to nell quickly and certainly she did you wrong for you were troth plight to her
things must be as they may
men may sleep and they may have their throats about them at that time and some say knives have edges
it must be as it may
though patience be a tired mare yet she will plod
here comes ancient pistol and his wife
base tike call’st thou me host
now by this hand i swear i scorn the term nor shall my nell keep lodgers
no by my troth not long for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight
nym and pistol draw o well a day lady if he be not drawn now
we shall see wilful adultery and murder committed
thou prick ear’d cur of iceland
good corporal nym show thy valour and put up your sword
the solus in thy most mervailous face the solus in thy teeth and in thy throat and in thy hateful lungs yea in thy maw perdy and which is worse within thy nasty mouth
i do retort the solus in thy bowels for i can take and pistol’s cock is up and flashing fire will follow
i am not barbason you cannot conjure me
i have an humour to knock you indifferently well
if you grow foul with me pistol i will scour you with my rapier as i may in fair terms
if you would walk off i would prick your guts a little in good terms as i may and that’s the humour of it
o braggart vile and damned furious wight
the grave doth gape and doting death is near therefore exhale
hear me hear me what i say
he that strikes the first stroke i’ll run him up to the hilts as i am a soldier
an oath of mickle might and fury shall abate
give me thy fist thy fore foot to me give
i will cut thy throat one time or other in fair terms that is the humour of it
“couple a gorge ” that is the word
o hound of crete think’st thou my spouse to get
to the spital go and from the powdering tub of infamy fetch forth the lazar kite of cressid’s kind doll tearsheet she by name and her espouse
i have and i will hold the quondam quickly for the only she and pauca there’s enough
mine host pistol you must come to my master and you hostess
he is very sick and would to bed
good bardolph put thy face between his sheets and do the office of a warming pan
by my troth he’ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days
the king has kill’d his heart
come shall i make you two friends
we must to france together why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another’s throats
let floods o’erswell and fiends for food howl on
you’ll pay me the eight shillings i won of you at betting
base is the slave that pays
that now i will have that’s the humour of it
by this sword he that makes the first thrust i’ll kill him by this sword i will
sword is an oath and oaths must have their course
corporal nym and thou wilt be friends be friends an thou wilt not why then be enemies with me too
i shall have my eight shillings i won from you at betting
a noble shalt thou have and present pay and liquor likewise will i give to thee and friendship shall combine and brotherhood
i’ll live by nym and nym shall live by me
for i shall sutler be unto the camp and profits will accrue
well then that’s the humour of’t
as ever you come of women come in quickly to sir john
he is so shak’d of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold
the king hath run bad humours on the knight that’s the even of it
nym thou hast spoke the right
his heart is fracted and corroborate
the king is a good king but it must be as it may he passes some humours and careers
let us condole the knight for lambkins we will live
’fore god his grace is bold to trust these traitors
they shall be apprehended by and by
how smooth and even they do bear themselves
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat crowned with faith and constant loyalty
the king hath note of all that they intend by interception which they dream not of
nay but the man that was his bed fellow whom he hath dull’d and cloy’d with gracious favours that he should for a foreign purse so sell his sovereign’s life to death and treachery
enter king henry scroop cambridge and grey
now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
my lord of cambridge and my kind lord of masham and you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them
no doubt my liege if each man do his best
i doubt not that since we are well persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us
never was monarch better fear’d and lov’d than is your majesty
there’s not i think a subject that sits in heart grief and uneasiness under the sweet shade of your government
true those that were your father’s enemies have steep’d their galls in honey and do serve you with hearts create of duty and of zeal
we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness
so service shall with steeled sinews toil and labour shall refresh itself with hope to do your grace incessant services
uncle of exeter enlarge the man committed yesterday that rail’d against our person
we consider it was excess of wine that set him on and on his more advice we pardon him
that’s mercy but too much security
let him be punish’d sovereign lest example breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
o let us yet be merciful
so may your highness and yet punish too
sir you show great mercy if you give him life after the taste of much correction
alas your too much love and care of me are heavy orisons ’gainst this poor wretch
if little faults proceeding on distemper shall not be wink’d at how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes chew’d swallow’d and digested appear before us
we’ll yet enlarge that man though cambridge scroop and grey in their dear care and tender preservation of our person would have him punish’d
and now to our french causes
your highness bade me ask for it today
so did you me my liege
then richard earl of cambridge there is yours there yours lord scroop of masham and sir knight grey of northumberland this same is yours
read them and know i know your worthiness
my lord of westmorland and uncle exeter we will aboard tonight —why how now gentlemen
what see you in those papers that you lose so much complexion —look ye how they change
their cheeks are paper —why what read you there that have so cowarded and chas’d your blood out of appearance
i do confess my fault and do submit me to your highness’ mercy
the mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppress’d and kill’d
you must not dare for shame to talk of mercy for your own reasons turn into your bosoms as dogs upon their masters worrying you
see you my princes and my noble peers these english monsters
my lord of cambridge here you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him with an appertinents belonging to his honour and this man hath for a few light crowns lightly conspir’d and sworn unto the practices of france to kill us here in hampton to the which this knight no less for bounty bound to us than cambridge is hath likewise sworn
but o what shall i say to thee lord scroop
thou cruel ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels that knew’st the very bottom of my soul that almost mightst have coin’d me into gold wouldst thou have practis’d on me for thy use — may it be possible that foreign hire could out of thee extract one spark of evil that might annoy my finger
’tis so strange that though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white my eye will scarcely see it
treason and murder ever kept together as two yoke devils sworn to either’s purpose working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them but thou ’gainst all proportion didst bring in wonder to wait on treason and on murder and whatsoever cunning fiend it was that wrought upon thee so preposterously hath got the voice in hell for excellence and other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches colours and with forms being fetch’d from glist’ring semblances of piety
but he that temper’d thee bade thee stand up gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
if that same demon that hath gull’d thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions “i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman’s ” o how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance
or are they spare in diet free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit not swerving with the blood garnish’d and deck’d in modest complement not working with the eye without the ear and but in purged judgement trusting neither
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best indued with some suspicion
i will weep for thee for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man
arrest them to the answer of the law and god acquit them of their practices
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of richard earl of cambridge
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of henry lord scroop of masham
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas grey knight of northumberland
our purposes god justly hath discover’d and i repent my fault more than my death which i beseech your highness to forgive although my body pay the price of it
for me the gold of france did not seduce although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended
but god be thanked for prevention which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice beseeching god and you to pardon me
never did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy o’er myself prevented from a damned enterprise
my fault but not my body pardon sovereign
god quit you in his mercy
you have conspir’d against our royal person join’d with an enemy proclaim’d and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation
touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdom’s safety must so tender whose ruin you have sought that to her laws we do deliver you
get you therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offences
exeunt cambridge scroop and grey guarded now lords for france the enterprise whereof shall be to you as us like glorious
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings
we doubt not now but every rub is smoothed on our way
let us deliver our puissance into the hand of god putting it straight in expedition
no king of england if not king of france
enter pistol nym bardolph boy and hostess
prithee honey sweet husband let me bring thee to staines
no for my manly heart doth yearn
bardolph be blithe nym rouse thy vaunting veins boy bristle thy courage up for falstaff he is dead and we must yearn therefore
would i were with him wheresome’er he is either in heaven or in hell
nay sure he’s not in hell
he’s in arthur’s bosom if ever man went to arthur’s bosom
’a made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child
’a parted even just between twelve and one even at the turning o’ the tide for after i saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers’ ends i knew there was but one way for his nose was as sharp as a pen and ’a babbled of green fields
“how now sir john ” quoth i “what man
be o’ good cheer ” so ’a cried out “god god god ” three or four times
now i to comfort him bid him ’a should not think of god i hop’d there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet
so ’a bade me lay more clothes on his feet
i put my hand into the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone
then i felt to his knees and so upward and upward and all was as cold as any stone
they say he cried out of sack
yes that ’a did and said they were devils incarnate
’a could never abide carnation ’twas a colour he never liked
’a said once the devil would have him about women
’a did in some sort indeed handle women but then he was rheumatic and talk’d of the whore of babylon
do you not remember ’a saw a flea stick upon bardolph’s nose and ’a said it was a black soul burning in hell fire
well the fuel is gone that maintain’d that fire
that’s all the riches i got in his service
the king will be gone from southampton
my love give me thy lips
look to my chattels and my movables
let senses rule the word is “pitch and pay ” trust none for oaths are straws men’s faiths are wafer cakes and hold fast is the only dog my duck therefore caveto be thy counsellor
yoke fellows in arms let us to france like horse leeches my boys to suck to suck the very blood to suck
and that’s but unwholesome food they say
touch her soft mouth and march
i cannot kiss that is the humour of it but adieu
enter the french king the dauphin the dukes of berry and brittany the constable and others
thus comes the english with full power upon us and more than carefully it us concerns to answer royally in our defences
therefore the dukes of berry and of brittany of brabant and of orleans shall make forth and you prince dauphin with all swift dispatch to line and new repair our towns of war with men of courage and with means defendant for england his approaches makes as fierce as waters to the sucking of a gulf
it fits us then to be as provident as fears may teach us out of late examples left by the fatal and neglected english upon our fields
my most redoubted father it is most meet we arm us ’gainst the foe for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom though war nor no known quarrel were in question but that defences musters preparations should be maintain’d assembled and collected as were a war in expectation
therefore i say ’tis meet we all go forth to view the sick and feeble parts of france
and let us do it with no show of fear no with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun morris dance for my good liege she is so idly king’d her sceptre so fantastically borne by a vain giddy shallow humorous youth that fear attends her not
you are too much mistaken in this king
question your grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy how well supplied with noble counsellors how modest in exception and withal how terrible in constant resolution and you shall find his vanities forespent were but the outside of the roman brutus covering discretion with a coat of folly as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots that shall first spring and be most delicate
well ’tis not so my lord high constable but though we think it so it is no matter
in cases of defence ’tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems so the proportions of defence are fill’d which of a weak and niggardly projection doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting a little cloth
think we king harry strong and princes look you strongly arm to meet him
the kindred of him hath been flesh’d upon us and he is bred out of that bloody strain that haunted us in our familiar paths
witness our too much memorable shame when cressy battle fatally was struck and all our princes captiv’d by the hand of that black name edward black prince of wales whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing up in the air crown’d with the golden sun saw his heroical seed and smil’d to see him mangle the work of nature and deface the patterns that by god and by french fathers had twenty years been made
this is a stem of that victorious stock and let us fear the native mightiness and fate of him
ambassadors from harry king of england do crave admittance to your majesty
exeunt messenger and certain lords you see this chase is hotly follow’d friends
turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten runs far before them
good my sovereign take up the english short and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head
self love my liege is not so vile a sin as self neglecting
from him and thus he greets your majesty he wills you in the name of god almighty that you divest yourself and lay apart the borrowed glories that by gift of heaven by law of nature and of nations ’longs to him and to his heirs namely the crown and all wide stretched honours that pertain by custom and the ordinance of times unto the crown of france
that you may know ’tis no sinister nor no awkward claim pick’d from the worm holes of long vanish’d days nor from the dust of old oblivion rak’d he sends you this most memorable line in every branch truly demonstrative willing you overlook this pedigree and when you find him evenly deriv’d from his most fam’d of famous ancestors edward the third he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom indirectly held from him the native and true challenger
bloody constraint for if you hide the crown even in your hearts there will he rake for it
therefore in fierce tempest is he coming in thunder and in earthquake like a jove that if requiring fail he will compel and bids you in the bowels of the lord deliver up the crown and to take mercy on the poor souls for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws and on your head turning the widows’ tears the orphans’ cries the dead men’s blood the pining maidens’ groans for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers that shall be swallowed in this controversy
this is his claim his threat’ning and my message unless the dauphin be in presence here to whom expressly i bring greeting too
for us we will consider of this further
tomorrow shall you bear our full intent back to our brother of england
for the dauphin i stand here for him
slight regard contempt and anything that may not misbecome the mighty sender doth he prize you at
thus says my king an if your father’s highness do not in grant of all demands at large sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty he’ll call you to so hot an answer of it that caves and womby vaultages of france shall chide your trespass and return your mock in second accent of his ordinance
say if my father render fair return it is against my will for i desire nothing but odds with england
to that end as matching to his youth and vanity i did present him with the paris balls
he’ll make your paris louvre shake for it were it the mistress court of mighty europe and be assur’d you’ll find a difference as we his subjects have in wonder found between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now
now he weighs time even to the utmost grain
that you shall read in your own losses if he stay in france
tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
dispatch us with all speed lest that our king come here himself to question our delay for he is footed in this land already
you shall be soon dispatch’d with fair conditions
a night is but small breath and little pause to answer matters of this consequence
thus with imagin’d wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought
suppose that you have seen the well appointed king at hampton pier embark his royalty and his brave fleet with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning
play with your fancies and in them behold upon the hempen tackle ship boys climbing hear the shrill whistle which doth order give to sounds confus’d behold the threaden sails borne with the invisible and creeping wind draw the huge bottoms through the furrow’d sea breasting the lofty surge
o do but think you stand upon the rivage and behold a city on the inconstant billows dancing for so appears this fleet majestical holding due course to harfleur
grapple your minds to sternage of this navy and leave your england as dead midnight still guarded with grandsires babies and old women either past or not arriv’d to pith and puissance
for who is he whose chin is but enrich’d with one appearing hair that will not follow these cull’d and choice drawn cavaliers to france
work work your thoughts and therein see a siege behold the ordnance on their carriages with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur
suppose the ambassador from the french comes back tells harry that the king doth offer him katharine his daughter and with her to dowry some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
the offer likes not and the nimble gunner with linstock now the devilish cannon touches alarum and chambers go off and down goes all before them
still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind
enter king henry exeter bedford gloucester and soldiers with scaling ladders
once more unto the breach dear friends once more or close the wall up with our english dead
in peace there’s nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger stiffen the sinews summon up the blood disguise fair nature with hard favour’d rage then lend the eye a terrible aspect let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon let the brow o’erwhelm it as fearfully as does a galled rock o’erhang and jutty his confounded base swill’d with the wild and wasteful ocean
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height
on on you noblest english whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof
fathers that like so many alexanders have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheath’d their swords for lack of argument
dishonour not your mothers now attest that those whom you call’d fathers did beget you
be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war
and you good yeomen whose limbs were made in england show us here the mettle of your pasture let us swear that you are worth your breeding which i doubt not for there is none of you so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes
i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips straining upon the start
follow your spirit and upon this charge cry “god for harry
england and saint george ” exeunt
alarum and chambers go off scene ii
enter nym bardolph pistol and boy
to the breach to the breach
the knocks are too hot and for mine own part i have not a case of lives
the humour of it is too hot that is the very plain song of it
the plain song is most just for humours do abound
knocks go and come god’s vassals drop and die and sword and shield in bloody field doth win immortal fame
would i were in an alehouse in london
i would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety
if wishes would prevail with me my purpose should not fail with me but thither would i hie
as duly but not as truly as bird doth sing on bough
up to the breach you dogs
be merciful great duke to men of mould
abate thy rage abate thy manly rage abate thy rage great duke
good bawcock bate thy rage use lenity sweet chuck
as young as i am i have observ’d these three swashers
i am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man
for bardolph he is white liver’d and red fac’d by the means whereof ’a faces it out but fights not
for pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof ’a breaks words and keeps whole weapons
for nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest ’a should be thought a coward
but his few bad words are match’d with as few good deeds for ’a never broke any man’s head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk
they will steal anything and call it purchase
bardolph stole a lute case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three half pence
nym and bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in calais they stole a fire shovel
i knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals
they would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if i should take from another’s pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs
i must leave them and seek some better service
their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore i must cast it up
captain fluellen you must come presently to the mines
the duke of gloucester would speak with you
tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines for look you the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war
the concavities of it is not sufficient for look you the athversary you may discuss unto the duke look you is digt himself four yard under the countermines
by cheshu i think ’a will plow up all if there is not better directions
the duke of gloucester to whom the order of the siege is given is altogether directed by an irishman a very valiant gentleman i’ faith
it is captain macmorris is it not
by cheshu he is an ass as in the world
i will verify as much in his beard
he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars look you of the roman disciplines than is a puppy dog
here ’a comes and the scots captain captain jamy with him
captain jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman that is certain and of great expedition and knowledge in the anchient wars upon my particular knowledge of his directions
by cheshu he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the romans
i say gud day captain fluellen

the governor and some citizens on the walls the english forces below
enter king henry and his train
how yet resolves the governor of the town
this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst for as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the battery once again i will not leave the half achieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie buried
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the flesh’d soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow’ring infants
what is it then to me if impious war array’d in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smirch’d complexion all fell feats enlink’d to waste and desolation
what is’t to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation
what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career
we may as bootless spend our vain command upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore
therefore you men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people whiles yet my soldiers are in my command whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace o’erblows the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villainy
if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand defile the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dash’d to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus’d do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herod’s bloody hunting slaughtermen
will you yield and this avoid or guilty in defence be thus destroy’d
our expectation hath this day an end
the dauphin whom of succours we entreated returns us that his powers are yet not ready to raise so great a siege
therefore great king we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
enter our gates dispose of us and ours for we no longer are defensible
come uncle exeter go you and enter harfleur there remain and fortify it strongly ’gainst the french
for us dear uncle the winter coming on and sickness growing upon our soldiers we will retire to calais
tonight in harfleur will we be your guest tomorrow for the march are we addrest

allons nous à dîner exeunt scene v the same
enter the king of france the dauphin the duke of bourbon the constable of france and others
’tis certain he hath pass’d the river somme
and if he be not fought withal my lord let us not live in france let us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people
shall a few sprays of us the emptying of our fathers’ luxury our scions put in wild and savage stock spirt up so suddenly into the clouds and overlook their grafters
normans but bastard normans norman bastards
mort de ma vie if they march along unfought withal but i will sell my dukedom to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm in that nook shotten isle of albion
dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
is not their climate foggy raw and dull on whom as in despite the sun looks pale killing their fruit with frowns
can sodden water a drench for sur rein’d jades their barley broth decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
and shall our quick blood spirited with wine seem frosty
o for honour of our land let us not hang like roping icicles upon our houses’ thatch whiles a more frosty people sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields
poor we may call them in their native lords
by faith and honour our madams mock at us and plainly say our mettle is bred out and they will give their bodies to the lust of english youth to new store france with bastard warriors
they bid us to the english dancing schools and teach lavoltas high and swift corantos saying our grace is only in our heels and that we are most lofty runaways
let him greet england with our sharp defiance
and with spirit of honour edged more sharper than your swords hie to the field
charles delabreth high constable of france you dukes of orleans bourbon and of berry alençon brabant bar and burgundy jacques chatillon rambures vaudemont beaumont grandpré roussi and fauconbridge foix lestrale boucicault and charolois high dukes great princes barons lords and knights for your great seats now quit you of great shames
bar harry england that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of harfleur
rush on his host as doth the melted snow upon the valleys whose low vassal seat the alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
go down upon him you have power enough and in a captive chariot into rouen bring him our prisoner
sorry am i his numbers are so few his soldiers sick and famish’d in their march for i am sure when he shall see our army he’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear and for achievement offer us his ransom
therefore lord constable haste on montjoy and let him say to england that we send to know what willing ransom he will give
prince dauphin you shall stay with us in rouen
not so i do beseech your majesty
be patient for you shall remain with us
now forth lord constable and princes all and quickly bring us word of england’s fall
i assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridge
is the duke of exeter safe
the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon and a man that i love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my life and my living and my uttermost power
he is not—god be praised and blessed —any hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline
there is an anchient lieutenant there at the pridge i think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as mark antony and he is a man of no estimation in the world but i did see him do as gallant service
captain i thee beseech to do me favours
the duke of exeter doth love thee well
ay i praise god and i have merited some love at his hands
bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart and of buxom valour hath by cruel fate and giddy fortune’s furious fickle wheel that goddess blind that stands upon the rolling restless stone— fluellen
fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore his eyes to signify to you that fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls
in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it
fortune is bardolph’s foe and frowns on him for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must ’a be — a damned death
let gallows gape for dog let man go free and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
but exeter hath given the doom of death for pax of little price
therefore go speak the duke will hear thy voice and let not bardolph’s vital thread be cut with edge of penny cord and vile reproach
speak captain for his life and i will thee requite
anchient pistol i do partly understand your meaning
certainly anchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother i would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be used
why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal
i remember him now a bawd a cutpurse
i’ll assure you ’a uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day
but it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well i warrant you when time is serve
why ’t is a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into london under the form of a soldier
and such fellows are perfect in the great commanders’ names and they will learn you by rote where services were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgrac’d what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with new tuned oaths and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale wash’d wits is wonderful to be thought on
but you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistook
i tell you what captain gower i do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is
if i find a hole in his coat i will tell him my mind
drum heard hark you the king is coming and i must speak with him from the pridge
enter king henry gloucester and his poor soldiers
the duke of exeter has very gallantly maintain’d the pridge
the french is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages
marry th’ athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the duke of exeter is master of the pridge
i can tell your majesty the duke is a prave man
what men have you lost fluellen
the perdition of the athversary hath been very great reasonable great
marry for my part i think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one bardolph if your majesty know the man
his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o’ fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire’s out
we would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compell’d from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner
you know me by my habit
what shall i know of thee
thus says my king say thou to harry of england though we seem’d dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness
tell him we could have rebuk’d him at harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe
now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial
england shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance
bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re answer his pettishness would bow under
for our losses his exchequer is too poor for the effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction
to this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounc’d
so far my king and master so much my office
turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessen’d and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen
yet forgive me god that i do brag thus
this your air of france hath blown that vice in me
go therefore tell thy master here i am my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbour stand in our way
go bid thy master well advise himself
if we may pass we will if we be hind’red we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolour and so montjoy fare you well
the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are nor as we are we say we will not shun it
i hope they will not come upon us now
we are in god’s hands brother not in theirs
march to the bridge it now draws toward night
beyond the river we’ll encamp ourselves and on tomorrow bid them march away
enter the constable of france the lord rambures orleans dauphin with others
i have the best armour of the world
you have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due
it is the best horse of europe
my lord of orleans and my lord high constable you talk of horse and armour
you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world
what a long night is this
i will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
he bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the pegasus qui a les narines de feu when i bestride him i soar i am a hawk
he trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes
he’s of the colour of the nutmeg
and of the heat of the ginger
it is a beast for perseus
he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him
he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts
indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse
it is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey
it is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all
’tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him
i once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus “wonder of nature ”— orleans
i have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress
then did they imitate that which i compos’d to my courser for my horse is my mistress
me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress
nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back
o then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of ireland your french hose off and in your strait strossers
you have good judgment in horsemanship
be warn’d by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs
i had rather have my horse to my mistress
i had as lief have my mistress a jade
i tell thee constable my mistress wears his own hair
i could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to my mistress
“ le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement et la truie lavée au bourbier ” thou mak’st use of anything
yet do i not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose
my lord constable the armour that i saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon it
some of them will fall tomorrow i hope
and yet my sky shall not want
that may be for you bear a many superfluously and ’twere more honour some were away
even as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted
would i were able to load him with his desert
i will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be paved with english faces
i will not say so for fear i should be fac’d out of my way
but i would it were morning for i would fain be about the ears of the english
who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
you must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
’tis midnight i’ll go arm myself
he longs to eat the english
i think he will eat all he kills
by the white hand of my lady he’s a gallant prince
swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
he is simply the most active gentleman of france
doing is activity and he will still be doing
he never did harm that i heard of
he will keep that good name still
i know him to be valiant
i was told that by one that knows him better than you
marry he told me so himself and he said he car’d not who knew it
he needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
by my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but his lackey
’tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate
“ill will never said well ” constable
i will cap that proverb with “there is flattery in friendship ” orleans
and i will take up that with “give the devil his due ” constable
there stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with “a pox of the devil ” orleans
you are the better at proverbs by how much “a fool’s bolt is soon shot ” constable
’tis not the first time you were overshot
my lord high constable the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents
a valiant and most expert gentleman
alas poor harry of england he longs not for the dawning as we do
what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of england to mope with his fat brain’d followers so far out of his knowledge
if the english had any apprehension they would run away
that they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head pieces
that island of england breeds very valiant creatures
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crush’d like rotten apples
you may as well say that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion
just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
ay but these english are shrewdly out of beef
then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight
now is it time to arm
it is now two o’clock but let me see by ten we shall have each a hundred englishmen
now entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe
from camp to camp through the foul womb of night the hum of either army stilly sounds that the fix’d sentinels almost receive the secret whispers of each other’s watch fire answers fire and through their paly flames each battle sees the other’s umber’d face steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs piercing the night’s dull ear and from the tents the armourers accomplishing the knights with busy hammers closing rivets up give dreadful note of preparation
the country cocks do crow the clocks do toll and the third hour of drowsy morning name
proud of their numbers and secure in soul the confident and over lusty french do the low rated english play at dice and chide the cripple tardy gaited night who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp so tediously away
the poor condemned english like sacrifices by their watchful fires sit patiently and inly ruminate the morning’s danger and their gesture sad investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats presented them unto the gazing moon so many horrid ghosts
o now who will behold the royal captain of this ruin’d band walking from watch to watch from tent to tent let him cry “praise and glory on his head ” for forth he goes and visits all his host bids them good morrow with a modest smile and calls them brothers friends and countrymen
upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour unto the weary and all watched night but freshly looks and over bears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty that every wretch pining and pale before beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
a largess universal like the sun his liberal eye doth give to everyone thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all behold as may unworthiness define a little touch of harry in the night
and so our scene must to the battle fly where—o for pity —we shall much disgrace with four or five most vile and ragged foils right ill dispos’d in brawl ridiculous the name of agincourt
yet sit and see minding true things by what their mock’ries be
enter king henry bedford and gloucester
gloucester ’tis true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be
there is some soul of goodness in things evil would men observingly distil it out for our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry
besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end
thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself
good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france
not so my liege this lodging likes me better since i may say “now lie i like a king ” king henry
’tis good for men to love their present pains upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quick’ned out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted slough and fresh legerity
lend me thy cloak sir thomas
brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them all to my pavilion
no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england
i and my bosom must debate a while and then i would no other company
the lord in heaven bless thee noble harry
exeunt all but king king henry
discuss unto me art thou officer
or art thou base common and popular
i am a gentleman of a company
as good a gentleman as the emperor
then you are a better than the king
the king’s a bawcock and a heart of gold a lad of life an imp of fame of parents good of fist most valiant
i kiss his dirty shoe and from heart string i love the lovely bully
tell him i’ll knock his leek about his pate upon saint davy’s day
do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours
it sorts well with your fierceness
in the name of jesu christ speak lower
it is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and anchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept
if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great you shall find i warrant you that there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble pabble in pompey’s camp
i warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb
i pray you and beseech you that you will
exeunt gower and fluellen king henry
though it appear a little out of fashion there is much care and valour in this welshman
enter three soldiers john bates alexander court and michael williams
brother john bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder
i think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day
we see yonder the beginning of the day but i think we shall never see the end of it
a good old commander and a most kind gentleman
i pray you what thinks he of our estate
even as men wreck’d upon a sand that look to be wash’d off the next tide
he hath not told his thought to the king
no nor it is not meet he should
for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am
the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions
his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing
therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army
he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as ’tis he could wish himself in thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here
by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is
then i would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor men’s lives saved
i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds
methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the king’s subjects
if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us
but if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopp’d off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all “we died at such a place” some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left
i am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument
now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection
so if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master’s command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcil’d iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation
the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services
besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers
some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery
now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from god
war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that here men are punish’d for before breach of the king’s laws in now the king’s quarrel
where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish
then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited
every subject’s duty is the king’s but every subject’s soul is his own
therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare
’tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head the king is not to answer for it
i do not desire he should answer for me and yet i determine to fight lustily for him
i myself heard the king say he would not be ransom’d
ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransom’d and we ne’er the wiser
if i live to see it i will never trust his word after
that’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch
you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather
you’ll never trust his word after
your reproof is something too round
i should be angry with you if the time were convenient
let it be a quarrel between us if you live
how shall i know thee again
give me any gage of thine and i will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it i will make it my quarrel
here’s my glove give me another of thine
this will i also wear in my cap
if ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow “this is my glove ” by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear
if ever i live to see it i will challenge it
thou dar’st as well be hang’d
well i will do it though i take thee in the king’s company
keep thy word fare thee well
be friends you english fools be friends
we have french quarrels enough if you could tell how to reckon
indeed the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no english treason to cut french crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper
let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king
o hard condition twin born with greatness subject to the breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing
what infinite heart’s ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy
and what have kings that privates have not too save ceremony save general ceremony
and what art thou thou idol ceremony
what kind of god art thou that suffer’st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
o ceremony show me but thy worth
what is thy soul of adoration
art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men
wherein thou art less happy being fear’d than they in fearing
what drink’st thou oft instead of homage sweet but poison’d flattery
o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure
think’st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation
will it give place to flexure and low bending
canst thou when thou command’st the beggar’s knee command the health of it
the slave a member of the country’s peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the peasant best advantages
my lord your nobles jealous of your absence seek through your camp to find you
good old knight collect them all together at my tent
take from them now the sense of reckoning if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them
not today o lord o not today think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown
i richard’s body have interred new and on it have bestow’d more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood
five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice a day their wither’d hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard’s soul
more will i do though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon
ay i know thy errand i will go with thee
the day my friends and all things stay for me
enter the dauphin orleans rambures and others
the sun doth gild our armour up my lords
monte à cheval my horse varlet
via les eaux et terre orleans
hark how our steeds for present service neigh
mount them and make incision in their hides that their hot blood may spin in english eyes and dout them with superfluous courage ha
what will you have them weep our horses’ blood
how shall we then behold their natural tears
the english are embattl’d you french peers
do but behold yon poor and starved band and your fair show shall suck away their souls leaving them but the shales and husks of men
there is not work enough for all our hands scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins to give each naked curtle axe a stain that our french gallants shall today draw out and sheathe for lack of sport
let us but blow on them the vapour of our valour will o’erturn them
’tis positive ’gainst all exceptions lords that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants who in unnecessary action swarm about our squares of battle were enough to purge this field of such a hilding foe though we upon this mountain’s basis by took stand for idle speculation but that our honours must not
a very little little let us do and all is done
then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount for our approach shall so much dare the field that england shall crouch down in fear and yield
why do you stay so long my lords of france
yond island carrions desperate of their bones ill favouredly become the morning field
their ragged curtains poorly are let loose and our air shakes them passing scornfully
big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar’d host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks with torch staves in their hand and their poor jades lob down their heads drooping the hides and hips the gum down roping from their pale dead eyes and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit lies foul with chew’d grass still and motionless and their executors the knavish crows fly o’er them all impatient for their hour
description cannot suit itself in words to demonstrate the life of such a battle in life so lifeless as it shows itself
they have said their prayers and they stay for death
shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits and give their fasting horses provender and after fight with them
i stay but for my guard on to the field
i will the banner from a trumpet take and use it for my haste
the sun is high and we outwear the day
enter gloucester bedford exeter erpingham with all his host salisbury and westmorland
the king himself is rode to view their battle
of fighting men they have full three score thousand
there’s five to one besides they all are fresh
god be wi’ you princes all i’ll to my charge
if we no more meet till we meet in heaven then joyfully my noble lord of bedford my dear lord gloucester and my good lord exeter and my kind kinsman warriors all adieu
farewell good salisbury and good luck go with thee
farewell kind lord fight valiantly today
and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it for thou art fram’d of the firm truth of valour
he is as full of valour as of kindness princely in both
o that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in england that do no work today
if we are mark’d to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honour
i pray thee wish not one man more
by jove i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost it yearns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honour i am the most offending soul alive
no faith my coz wish not a man from england
i would not lose so great an honour as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hope i have
o do not wish one more
rather proclaim it westmorland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight let him depart
his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse
we would not die in that man’s company that fears his fellowship to die with us
this day is call’d the feast of crispian
he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a tip toe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of crispian
he that shall live this day and see old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours and say “tomorrow is saint crispian ” then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say “these wounds i had on crispian’s day ” old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he’ll remember with advantages what feats he did that day
then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered
this story shall the good man teach his son and crispin crispian shall ne’er go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered we few we happy few we band of brothers
for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne’er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin’s day
my sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
the french are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us
all things are ready if our minds be so
perish the man whose mind is backward now
thou dost not wish more help from england coz
my liege would you and i alone without more help could fight this royal battle
why now thou hast unwish’d five thousand men which likes me better than to wish us one
once more i come to know of thee king harry if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound before thy most assured overthrow for certainly thou art so near the gulf thou needs must be englutted
besides in mercy the constable desires thee thou wilt mind thy followers of repentance that their souls may make a peaceful and a sweet retire from off these fields where wretches their poor bodies must lie and fester
i pray thee bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
why should they mock poor fellows thus
the man that once did sell the lion’s skin while the beast liv’d was kill’d with hunting him
a many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves upon the which i trust shall witness live in brass of this day’s work and those that leave their valiant bones in france dying like men though buried in your dunghills they shall be fam’d for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honours reeking up to heaven leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france
mark then abounding valour in our english that being dead like to the bullet’s grazing break out into a second course of mischief killing in relapse of mortality
let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day
our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch’d with rainy marching in the painful field there’s not a piece of feather in our host— good argument i hope we will not fly— and time hath worn us into slovenry but by the mass our hearts are in the trim and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night they’ll be in fresher robes or they will pluck the gay new coats o’er the french soldiers’ heads and turn them out of service
if they do this— as if god please they shall —my ransom then will soon be levied
come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
they shall have none i swear but these my joints which if they have as i will leave ’em them shall yield them little tell the constable
and so fare thee well thou never shalt hear herald any more
i fear thou’lt once more come again for ransom
my lord most humbly on my knee i beg the leading of the vaward
now soldiers march away and how thou pleasest god dispose the day
enter pistol french soldier and boy
je pense que vous êtes le gentilhomme de bonne qualité pistol
caleno custore me art thou a gentleman
o signieur dew should be a gentleman
perpend my words o signieur dew and mark o signieur dew thou diest on point of fox except o signieur thou do give to me egregious ransom

il me commande à vous dire que vous faites vous prêt car ce soldat ici est disposé tout à cette heure de couper votre gorge pistol

he prays you to save his life
he is a gentleman of a good house and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns
tell him my fury shall abate and i the crowns will take
petit monsieur que dit il boy
encore qu’il est contre son jurement de pardonner aucun prisonnier néanmoins pour les écus que vous lui avez promis il est content à vous donner la liberté le franchisement french soldier
sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remerciements et je m’estime heureux que je suis tombé entre les mains d’un chevalier je pense le plus brave vaillant et très distingué seigneur d’angleterre pistol
he gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks and he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into the hands of one as he thinks the most brave valorous and thrice worthy seigneur of england
as i suck blood i will some mercy show
suivez vous le grand capitaine exeunt pistol and french soldier i did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart but the saying is true “the empty vessel makes the greatest sound ” bardolph and nym had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i’ the old play that everyone may pare his nails with a wooden dagger and they are both hang’d and so would this be if he durst steal anything adventurously
i must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp
the french might have a good prey of us if he knew of it for there is none to guard it but boys
exit scene v another part of the field
enter constable orleans bourbon dauphin and rambures
le jour est perdu tout est perdu dauphin
mort de ma vie all is confounded all
reproach and everlasting shame sits mocking in our plumes
a short alarum o méchante fortune do not run away
why all our ranks are broke
let’s stab ourselves be these the wretches that we play’d at dice for
is this the king we sent to for his ransom
shame and eternal shame nothing but shame
and he that will not follow bourbon now let him go hence and with his cap in hand like a base pandar hold the chamber door whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog his fairest daughter is contaminated
disorder that hath spoil’d us friend us now
let us on heaps go offer up our lives
we are enough yet living in the field to smother up the english in our throngs if any order might be thought upon
let life be short else shame will be too long
enter king henry and his train with prisoners
well have we done thrice valiant countrymen
but all’s not done yet keep the french the field
the duke of york commends him to your majesty
thrice within this hour i saw him down thrice up again and fighting
from helmet to the spur all blood he was
in which array brave soldier doth he lie larding the plain and by his bloody side yoke fellow to his honour owing wounds the noble earl of suffolk also lies
suffolk first died and york all haggled over comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes that bloodily did yawn upon his face
he cries aloud “tarry my cousin suffolk
my soul shall thine keep company to heaven tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast as in this glorious and well foughten field we kept together in our chivalry ” upon these words i came and cheer’d him up
he smil’d me in the face raught me his hand and with a feeble gripe says “dear my lord commend my service to my sovereign ” so did he turn and over suffolk’s neck he threw his wounded arm and kiss’d his lips and so espous’d to death with blood he seal’d a testament of noble ending love
the pretty and sweet manner of it forc’d those waters from me which i would have stopp’d but i had not so much of man in me and all my mother came into mine eyes and gave me up to tears
i blame you not for hearing this i must perforce compound with mistful eyes or they will issue too
what new alarum is this same
the french have reinforc’d their scatter’d men
then every soldier kill his prisoners give the word through
kill the poys and the luggage
’tis expressly against the law of arms
’tis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offer’t in your conscience now is it not
’tis certain there’s not a boy left alive and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha’ done this slaughter
besides they have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent wherefore the king most worthily hath caus’d every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat
ay he was porn at monmouth captain gower
what call you the town’s name where alexander the pig was born
why i pray you is not pig great
the pig or the great or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous are all one reckonings save the phrase is a little variations
i think alexander the great was born in macedon
his father was called philip of macedon as i take it
i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn
i tell you captain if you look in the maps of the ’orld i warrant you sall find in the comparisons between macedon and monmouth that the situations look you is both alike
there is a river in macedon and there is also moreover a river at monmouth it is call’d wye at monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river but ’tis all one ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers and there is salmons in both
if you mark alexander’s life well harry of monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well for there is figures in all things
alexander god knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and his angers look you kill his best friend cleitus
our king is not like him in that
he never kill’d any of his friends
it is not well done mark you now to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished
i speak but in the figures and comparisons of it
as alexander kill’d his friend cleitus being in his ales and his cups so also harry monmouth being in his right wits and his good judgements turn’d away the fat knight with the great belly doublet
he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries and mocks i have forgot his name
i’ll tell you there is good men porn at monmouth
enter king henry and forces warwick gloucester exeter with prisoners
i was not angry since i came to france until this instant
take a trumpet herald ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill
if they will fight with us bid them come down or void the field they do offend our sight
if they’ll do neither we will come to them and make them skirr away as swift as stones enforced from the old assyrian slings
besides we’ll cut the throats of those we have and not a man of them that we shall take shall taste our mercy
here comes the herald of the french my liege
his eyes are humbler than they us’d to be
know’st thou not that i have fin’d these bones of mine for ransom
no great king i come to thee for charitable license that we may wander o’er this bloody field to book our dead and then to bury them to sort our nobles from our common men
for many of our princes—woe the while — lie drown’d and soak’d in mercenary blood so do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs in blood of princes and their wounded steeds fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters killing them twice
o give us leave great king to view the field in safety and dispose of their dead bodies
i tell thee truly herald i know not if the day be ours or no for yet a many of your horsemen peer and gallop o’er the field
praised be god and not our strength for it
what is this castle call’d that stands hard by
then call we this the field of agincourt fought on the day of crispin crispianus
your grandfather of famous memory an’t please your majesty and your great uncle edward the plack prince of wales as i have read in the chronicles fought a most prave pattle here in france
if your majesties is rememb’red of it the welshmen did good service in garden where leeks did grow wearing leeks in their monmouth caps which your majesty know to this hour is an honourable badge of the service and i do believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon saint tavy’s day

soldier why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap

an’t please your majesty a rascal that swagger’d with me last night who if alive and ever dare to challenge this glove i have sworn to take him a box o’ the ear or if i can see my glove in his cap which he swore as he was a soldier he would wear if alive i will strike it out soundly
what think you captain fluellen is it fit this soldier keep his oath
he is a craven and a villain else an’t please your majesty in my conscience

though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is as lucifier and belzebub himself it is necessary look your grace that he keep his vow and his oath
if he be perjur’d see you now his reputation is as arrant a villain and a jacksauce as ever his black shoe trod upon god’s ground and his earth in my conscience la

so i will my liege as i live
gower is a good captain and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars
call him hither to me soldier
here fluellen wear thou this favour for me and stick it in thy cap
when alençon and myself were down together i pluck’d this glove from his helm
if any man challenge this he is a friend to alençon and an enemy to our person
if thou encounter any such apprehend him an thou dost me love
your grace does me as great honours as can be desir’d in the hearts of his subjects
i would fain see the man that has but two legs that shall find himself aggrief’d at this glove that is all
but i would fain see it once an please god of his grace that i might see
he is my dear friend an please you
pray thee go seek him and bring him to my tent
my lord of warwick and my brother gloucester follow fluellen closely at the heels
the glove which i have given him for a favour may haply purchase him a box o’ the ear
it is the soldier’s i by bargain should wear it myself
if that the soldier strike him as i judge by his blunt bearing he will keep his word some sudden mischief may arise of it for i do know fluellen valiant and touch’d with choler hot as gunpowder and quickly will return an injury
follow and see there be no harm between them
go you with me uncle of exeter
i warrant it is to knight you captain

my lord of warwick here is—praised be god for it —a most contagious treason come to light look you as you shall desire in a summer’s day

i hope your majesty is pear me testimony and witness and will avouchment that this is the glove of alençon that your majesty is give me in your conscience now
look here is the fellow of it
’twas i indeed thou promisedst to strike and thou hast given me most bitter terms
an it please your majesty let his neck answer for it if there is any martial law in the world
how canst thou make me satisfaction
all offences my lord come from the heart
never came any from mine that might offend your majesty
it was ourself thou didst abuse
your majesty came not like yourself
you appear’d to me but as a common man witness the night your garments your lowliness and what your highness suffer’d under that shape i beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine for had you been as i took you for i made no offence therefore i beseech your highness pardon me
here uncle exeter fill this glove with crowns and give it to this fellow
keep it fellow and wear it for an honour in thy cap till i do challenge it
give him his crowns and captain you must needs be friends with him
by this day and this light the fellow has mettle enough in his belly

i will none of your money
it is with a good will i can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes
come wherefore should you be so pashful
your shoes is not so good
’tis a good silling i warrant you or i will change it
now herald are the dead numb’red
here is the number of the slaught’red french
what prisoners of good sort are taken uncle
charles duke of orleans nephew to the king john duke of bourbon and lord boucicault of other lords and barons knights and squires full fifteen hundred besides common men
this note doth tell me of ten thousand french that in the field lie slain of princes in this number and nobles bearing banners there lie dead one hundred twenty six added to these of knights esquires and gallant gentlemen eight thousand and four hundred of the which five hundred were but yesterday dubb’d knights so that in these ten thousand they have lost there are but sixteen hundred mercenaries the rest are princes barons lords knights squires and gentlemen of blood and quality
the names of those their nobles that lie dead charles delabreth high constable of france jacques of chatillon admiral of france the master of the crossbows lord rambures great master of france the brave sir guichard dauphin john duke of alençon anthony duke of brabant the brother to the duke of burgundy and edward duke of bar of lusty earls grandpré and roussi fauconbridge and foix beaumont and marle vaudemont and lestrale
here was a royal fellowship of death
where is the number of our english dead
herald gives him another paper edward the duke of york the earl of suffolk sir richard ketly davy gam esquire none else of name and of all other men but five and twenty —o god thy arm was here and not to us but to thy arm alone ascribe we all
when without stratagem but in plain shock and even play of battle was ever known so great and little loss on one part and on the other
take it god for it is none but thine
come go we in procession to the village and be it death proclaimed through our host to boast of this or take that praise from god which is his only
is it not lawful an please your majesty to tell how many is kill’d
yes captain but with this acknowledgment that god fought for us
yes my conscience he did us great good
let there be sung non nobis and te deum the dead with charity enclos’d in clay and then to calais and to england then where ne’er from france arriv’d more happy men
vouchsafe to those that have not read the story that i may prompt them and of such as have i humbly pray them to admit the excuse of time of numbers and due course of things which cannot in their huge and proper life be here presented
now we bear the king toward calais grant him there there seen heave him away upon your winged thoughts athwart the sea
behold the english beach pales in the flood with men with wives and boys whose shouts and claps out voice the deep mouth’d sea which like a mighty whiffler ’fore the king seems to prepare his way
so let him land and solemnly see him set on to london
so swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon blackheath where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruised helmet and his bended sword before him through the city
he forbids it being free from vainness and self glorious pride giving full trophy signal and ostent quite from himself to god
but now behold in the quick forge and working house of thought how london doth pour out her citizens
the mayor and all his brethren in best sort like to the senators of th’ antique rome with the plebeians swarming at their heels go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in as by a lower but loving likelihood were now the general of our gracious empress as in good time he may from ireland coming bringing rebellion broached on his sword how many would the peaceful city quit to welcome him
much more and much more cause did they this harry
now in london place him as yet the lamentation of the french invites the king of england’s stay at home the emperor’s coming in behalf of france to order peace between them —and omit all the occurrences whatever chanc’d till harry’s back return again to france
there must we bring him and myself have play’d the interim by rememb’ring you ’tis past
then brook abridgement and your eyes advance after your thoughts straight back again to france
nay that’s right but why wear you your leek today
there is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things

the rascally scald beggarly lousy pragging knave pistol which you and yourself and all the world know to be no petter than a fellow look you now of no merits he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday look you and bid me eat my leek
it was in a place where i could not breed no contention with him but i will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till i see him once again and then i will tell him a little piece of my desires
why here he comes swelling like a turkey cock
’tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey cocks

dost thou thirst base trojan to have me fold up parca’s fatal web
i am qualmish at the smell of leek
i peseech you heartily scurfy lousy knave at my desires and my requests and my petitions to eat look you this leek
because look you you do not love it nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it i would desire you to eat it
not for cadwallader and all his goats
there is one goat for you

you say very true scald knave when god’s will is
i will desire you to live in the mean time and eat your victuals
come there is sauce for it
strikes him you call’d me yesterday mountain squire but i will make you today a squire of low degree
i pray you fall to if you can mock a leek you can eat a leek
enough captain you have astonish’d him
i say i will make him eat some part of my leek or i will peat his pate four days
bite i pray you it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb
yes certainly and out of doubt and out of question too and ambiguities
by this leek i will most horribly revenge

quiet thy cudgel thou dost see i eat

nay pray you throw none away the skin is good for your broken coxcomb
when you take occasions to see leeks hereafter i pray you mock at ’em that is all

yes verily and in truth you shall take it or i have another leek in my pocket which you shall eat
i take thy groat in earnest of revenge

god be wi’ you and keep you and heal your pate
all hell shall stir for this
go go you are a couterfeit cowardly knave
will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honourable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words
i have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice
you thought because he could not speak english in the native garb he could not therefore handle an english cudgel
you find it otherwise and henceforth let a welsh correction teach you a good english condition
doth fortune play the huswife with me now
news have i that my doll is dead i’ the spital of malady of france and there my rendezvous is quite cut off
old i do wax and from my weary limbs honour is cudgell’d
well bawd i’ll turn and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand
to england will i steal and there i’ll steal and patches will i get unto these cudgell’d scars and swear i got them in the gallia wars
enter at one door king henry exeter bedford warwick gloucester westmorland clarence huntingdon and other lords
at another queen isabel the french king the princess katharine alice and other ladies the duke of burgundy and other french
peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
unto our brother france and to our sister health and fair time of day joy and good wishes to our most fair and princely cousin katharine and as a branch and member of this royalty by whom this great assembly is contriv’d we do salute you duke of burgundy and princes french and peers health to you all
right joyous are we to behold your face most worthy brother england fairly met
so are you princes english every one
so happy be the issue brother england of this good day and of this gracious meeting as we are now glad to behold your eyes your eyes which hitherto have borne in them against the french that met them in their bent the fatal balls of murdering basilisks
the venom of such looks we fairly hope have lost their quality and that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
to cry amen to that thus we appear
you english princes all i do salute you
my duty to you both on equal love great kings of france and england
that i have labour’d with all my wits my pains and strong endeavours to bring your most imperial majesties unto this bar and royal interview your mightiness on both parts best can witness
since then my office hath so far prevail’d that face to face and royal eye to eye you have congreeted let it not disgrace me if i demand before this royal view what rub or what impediment there is why that the naked poor and mangled peace dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births should not in this best garden of the world our fertile france put up her lovely visage
alas she hath from france too long been chas’d and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps corrupting in it own fertility
even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost or do not learn for want of time the sciences that should become our country but grow like savages —as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood — to swearing and stern looks diffus’d attire and everything that seems unnatural
which to reduce into our former favour you are assembled and my speech entreats that i may know the let why gentle peace should not expel these inconveniences and bless us with her former qualities
if duke of burgundy you would the peace whose want gives growth to the imperfections which you have cited you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands whose tenours and particular effects you have enschedul’d briefly in your hands
the king hath heard them to the which as yet there is no answer made
well then the peace which you before so urg’d lies in his answer
i have but with a cursorary eye o’erglanc’d the articles
pleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council presently to sit with us once more with better heed to re survey them we will suddenly pass our accept and peremptory answer
go uncle exeter and brother clarence and you brother gloucester warwick and huntington go with the king and take with you free power to ratify augment or alter as your wisdoms best shall see advantageable for our dignity anything in or out of our demands and we’ll consign thereto
will you fair sister go with the princes or stay here with us
our gracious brother i will go with them
haply a woman’s voice may do some good when articles too nicely urg’d be stood on
yet leave our cousin katharine here with us she is our capital demand compris’d within the fore rank of our articles
exeunt all except henry katharine and alice king henry
fair katharine and most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady’s ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart
your majesty shall mock me i cannot speak your england
o fair katharine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue
pardonnez moi i cannot tell wat is “like me ” king henry
an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel
que je suis semblable à les anges alice
oui vraiment sauf votre grâce ainsi dit il king henry
i said so dear katharine and i must not blush to affirm it
les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies king henry
that the tongues of men are full of deceits
oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de princess
the princess is the better englishwoman
i’ faith kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding
i am glad thou canst speak no better english for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown
i know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say “i love you” then if you urge me farther than to say “do you in faith ” i wear out my suit
give me your answer i’ faith do and so clap hands and a bargain
sauf votre honneur me understand well
marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength
if i could win a lady at leap frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into a wife
or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack an apes never off
but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor i have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urg’d nor never break for urging
if thou canst love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook
i speak to thee plain soldier
if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die is true but for thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too
and while thou liv’st dear kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favours they do always reason themselves out again
a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad
a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl’d pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
if thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king
and what say’st thou then to my love
speak my fair and fairly i pray thee
is it possible dat i should love de enemy of france
no it is not possible you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine
i cannot tell wat is dat
i will tell thee in french which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband’s neck hardly to be shook off
je quand sur le possession de france et quand vous avez le possession de moi —let me see what then
saint denis be my speed — donc votre est france et vous êtes mienne it is as easy for me kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french
i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me
sauf votre honneur le français que vous parlez il est meilleur que l’anglais lequel je parle king henry
no faith is’t not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one
but kate dost thou understand thus much english canst thou love me
can any of your neighbours tell kate
come i know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you’ll question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart
but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly
if ever thou beest mine kate as i have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt i get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder
shall not thou and i between saint denis and saint george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard
what say’st thou my fair flower de luce
no ’tis hereafter to know but now to promise
do but now promise kate you will endeavour for your french part of such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor
how answer you la plus belle katherine du monde mon très cher et divin déesse katharine
your majestee ’ave fausse french enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en france
now fie upon my false french
by mine honour in true english i love thee kate by which honour i dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage
he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them
but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear
my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face
thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair katharine will you have me
put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am thine which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is thine ireland is thine france is thine and henry plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows
come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy english broken therefore queen of all katharine break thy mind to me in broken english
dat is as it shall please le roi mon père
nay it will please him well kate it shall please him kate
den it sall also content me
upon that i kiss your hand and call you my queen
ma foi je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d’une—notre seigneur —indigne serviteur
excusez moi je vous supplie mon très puissant seigneur king henry
then i will kiss your lips kate
les dames et demoiselles pour être baisées devant leurs noces il n’est pas la coutume de france king henry
madame my interpreter what says she
dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of france —i cannot tell wat is baiser en anglish
your majestee entend bettre que moi
it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss before they are married would she say
o kate nice customs curtsy to great kings
dear kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion
we are the makers of manners kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find faults as i will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding
kissing her you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the french council and they should sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs
enter the french power and the english lords
my royal cousin teach you our princess english
i would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly i love her and that is good english
our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me i cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness
pardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that
if you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind
can you blame her then being a maid yet ros’d over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self
it were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to
yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces
they are then excus’d my lord when they see not what they do
then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking
i will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summer’d and warm kept are like flies at bartholomew tide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on
this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so i shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too
as love is my lord before it loves
it is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who cannot see many a fair french city for one fair french maid that stands in my way
yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities turn’d into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that no war hath entered
i am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will
we have consented to all terms of reason
is’t so my lords of england
the king hath granted every article his daughter first and then in sequel all according to their firm proposed natures
only he hath not yet subscribed this where your majesty demands that the king of france having any occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your highness in this form and with this addition in french notre très cher fils henri roi d’angleterre héritier de france and thus in latin praeclarissimus filius noster henricus rex angliae et haeres franciae french king
nor this i have not brother so denied but our request shall make me let it pass
i pray you then in love and dear alliance let that one article rank with the rest and thereupon give me your daughter
take her fair son and from her blood raise up issue to me that the contending kingdoms of france and england whose very shores look pale with envy of each other’s happiness may cease their hatred and this dear conjunction plant neighbourhood and christian like accord in their sweet bosoms that never war advance his bleeding sword ’twixt england and fair france
now welcome kate and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen
god the best maker of all marriages combine your hearts in one your realms in one
as man and wife being two are one in love so be there ’twixt your kingdoms such a spousal that never may ill office or fell jealousy which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms to make divorce of their incorporate league that english may as french french englishmen receive each other
prepare we for our marriage on which day my lord of burgundy we’ll take your oath and all the peers’ for surety of our leagues then shall i swear to kate and you to me and may our oaths well kept and prosperous be

henry is dead and never shall revive
upon a wooden coffin we attend and death s dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify like captives bound to a triumphant car

my gracious lords to add to your laments wherewith you now bedew king henry s hearse i must inform you of a dismal fight betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french
o no wherein lord talbot was o erthrown
the circumstance i ll tell you more at large
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord retiring from the siege of orleans having full scarce six thousand in his troop by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon
no leisure had he to enrank his men he wanted pikes to set before his archers instead whereof sharp stakes pluck d out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly to keep the horsemen off from breaking in
more than three hours the fight continued where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him here there and everywhere enrag d he slew the french exclaim d the devil was in arms all the whole army stood agaz d on him
his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot
cried out amain and rush d into the bowels of the battle
here had the conquest fully been seal d up if sir john fastolfe had not play d the coward
he being in the vaward plac d behind with purpose to relieve and follow them cowardly fled not having struck one stroke hence grew the general wreck and massacre
enclosed were they with their enemies
a base walloon to win the dauphin s grace thrust talbot with a spear into the back whom all france with their chief assembled strength durst not presume to look once in the face
then i will slay myself for living idly here in pomp and ease whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid unto his dastard foemen is betray d
o no he lives but is took prisoner and lord scales with him and lord hungerford most of the rest slaughter d or took likewise
his ransom there is none but i shall pay
i ll hale the dauphin headlong from his throne his crown shall be the ransom of my friend four of their lords i ll change for one of ours
farewell my masters to my task will i bonfires in france forthwith i am to make to keep our great saint george s feast withal
ten thousand soldiers with me i will take whose bloody deeds shall make an europe quake
so you had need for orleans is besieg d the english army is grown weak and faint the earl of salisbury craveth supply and hardly keeps his men from mutiny since they so few watch such a multitude
remember lords your oaths to henry sworn either to quell the dauphin utterly or bring him in obedience to your yoke
i do remember it and here take my leave to go about my preparation
i ll to the tower with all the haste i can to view th artillery and munition and then i will proclaim young henry king
to eltham will i where the young king is being ordain d his special governor and for his safety there i ll best devise

but long i will not be jack out of office

chief master gunner am i of this town something i must do to procure me grace
the prince s espials have informed me how the english in the suburbs close intrench d wont through a secret grate of iron bars in yonder tower to overpeer the city and thence discover how with most advantage they may vex us with shot or with assault

exit enter salisbury and talbot on the turrets with sir william glansdale sir thomas gargrave and others salisbury
talbot my life my joy again return d
how wert thou handled being prisoner
or by what means got st thou to be releas d
discourse i prithee on this turret s top
the earl of bedford had a prisoner call d the brave lord ponton de santrailles for him was i exchang d and ransomed
but with a baser man of arms by far once in contempt they would have barter d me which i disdaining scorn d and craved death rather than i would be so vile esteem d
in fine redeem d i was as i desir d

yet tell st thou not how thou wert entertain d
with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts in open market place produc d they me to be a public spectacle to all here said they is the terror of the french the scarecrow that affrights our children so
then broke i from the officers that led me and with my nails digg d stones out of the ground to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly none durst come near for fear of sudden death
in iron walls they deem d me not secure so great fear of my name mongst them was spread that they suppos d i could rend bars of steel and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had that walk d about me every minute while and if i did but stir out of my bed ready they were to shoot me to the heart
enter the boy with a linstock salisbury
i grieve to hear what torments you endur d but we will be reveng d sufficiently
now it is supper time in orleans here through this grate i count each one and view the frenchmen how they fortify
let us look in the sight will much delight thee
sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale let me have your express opinions where is best place to make our batt ry next
i think at the north gate for there stand lords
and i here at the bulwark of the bridge
for aught i see this city must be famish d or with light skirmishes enfeebled
here they shoot and salisbury and gargrave fall down salisbury
o lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
o lord have mercy on me woeful man
what chance is this that suddenly hath cross d us
speak salisbury at least if thou canst speak
how far st thou mirror of all martial men
one of thy eyes and thy cheek s side struck off
accursed fatal hand that hath contriv d this woeful tragedy
in thirteen battles salisbury o ercame henry the fifth he first train d to the wars whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up his sword did ne er leave striking in the field
though thy speech doth fail one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace the sun with one eye vieweth all the world
heaven be thou gracious to none alive if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
bear hence his body i will help to bury it
sir thomas gargrave hast thou any life
speak unto talbot nay look up to him
salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort thou shalt not die whiles he beckons with his hand and smiles on me as who should say when i am dead and gone remember to avenge me on the french
plantagenet i will and like thee nero play on the lute beholding the towns burn
wretched shall france be only in my name
here an alarum and it thunders and lightens what stir is this
what tumult s in the heavens
whence cometh this alarum and the noise
my lord my lord the french have gather d head the dauphin with one joan la pucelle join d a holy prophetess new risen up is come with a great power to raise the siege
here salisbury lifteth himself up and groans talbot
hear hear how dying salisbury doth groan
it irks his heart he cannot be reveng d
frenchmen i ll be a salisbury to you
pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish your hearts i ll stamp out with my horse s heels and make a quagmire of your mingled brains
convey me salisbury into his tent and then we ll try what these dastard frenchmen dare
before orleans here an alarum again and talbot pursueth the dauphin and driveth him
then enter joan la pucelle driving englishmen before her
where is my strength my valour and my force
our english troops retire i cannot stay them a woman clad in armour chaseth them
enter la pucelle here here she comes
i ll have a bout with thee
devil or devil s dam i ll conjure thee blood will i draw on thee thou art a witch and straightway give thy soul to him thou serv st
come come tis only i that must disgrace thee
heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail
my breast i ll burst with straining of my courage
and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder but i will chastise this high minded strumpet
talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come
i must go victual orleans forthwith
a short alarum then enter the town with soldiers o ertake me if thou canst i scorn thy strength
go go cheer up thy hungry starved men help salisbury to make his testament
this day is ours as many more shall be
my thoughts are whirled like a potter s wheel i know not where i am nor what i do
a witch by fear not force like hannibal drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench are from their hives and houses driven away
they call d us for our fierceness english dogs now like to whelps we crying run away
either renew the fight or tear the lions out of england s coat renounce your soil give sheep in lions stead sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf or horse or oxen from the leopard as you fly from your oft subdued slaves
here another skirmish it will not be retire into your trenches
you all consented unto salisbury s death for none would strike a stroke in his revenge
pucelle is ent red into orleans in spite of us or aught that we could do
o would i were to die with salisbury
the shame hereof will make me hide my head
enter on the walls la pucelle charles reignier alencon and soldiers pucelle
advance our waving colours on the walls rescu d is orleans from the english
thus joan la pucelle hath perform d her word
divinest creature astraea s daughter how shall i honour thee for this success
thy promises are like adonis gardens that one day bloom d and fruitful were the next
france triumph in thy glorious prophetess
recover d is the town of orleans
more blessed hap did ne er befall our state
why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town
dauphin command the citizens make bonfires and feast and banquet in the open streets to celebrate the joy that god hath given us
all france will be replete with mirth and joy when they shall hear how we have play d the men
tis joan not we by whom the day is won for which i will divide my crown with her and all the priests and friars in my realm shall in procession sing her endless praise
a statelier pyramis to her i ll rear than rhodope s of memphis ever was
in memory of her when she is dead her ashes in an urn more precious than the rich jewel d coffer of darius transported shall be at high festivals before the kings and queens of france
no longer on saint denis will we cry but joan la pucelle shall be france s saint
come in and let us banquet royally after this golden day of victory
before orleans enter a french sergeant and two sentinels sergeant
sirs take your places and be vigilant
if any noise or soldier you perceive near to the walls by some apparent sign let us have knowledge at the court of guard
exit sergeant thus are poor servitors when others sleep upon their quiet beds constrain d to watch in darkness rain and cold
enter talbot bedford burgundy and forces with scaling ladders their drums beating a dead march talbot
lord regent and redoubted burgundy by whose approach the regions of artois wallon and picardy are friends to us this happy night the frenchmen are secure having all day carous d and banqueted embrace we then this opportunity as fitting best to quittance their deceit contriv d by art and baleful sorcery
coward of france how much he wrongs his fame despairing of his own arm s fortitude to join with witches and the help of hell
but what s that pucelle whom they term so pure
pray god she prove not masculine ere long if underneath the standard of the french she carry armour as she hath begun
well let them practise and converse with spirits god is our fortress in whose conquering name let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
ascend brave talbot we will follow thee
not all together better far i guess that we do make our entrance several ways that if it chance the one of us do fail the other yet may rise against their force
agreed i ll to yond corner
and here will talbot mount or make his grave
now salisbury for thee and for the right of english henry shall this night appear how much in duty i am bound to both
the english scale the walls and cry saint george
the french leap o er the walls in their shirts
enter several ways bastard alencon reignier half ready and half unready alencon
ay and glad we scap d so well
twas time i trow to wake and leave our beds hearing alarums at our chamber doors
of all exploits since first i follow d arms ne er heard i of a warlike enterprise more venturous or desperate than this
i think this talbot be a fiend of hell
if not of hell the heavens sure favour him alencon
here cometh charles i marvel how he sped
enter charles and la pucelle bastard
holy joan was his defensive guard
is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
didst thou at first to flatter us withal make us partakers of a little gain that now our loss might be ten times so much
wherefore is charles impatient with his friend
at all times will you have my power alike
sleeping or waking must i still prevail or will you blame and lay the fault on me
had your watch been good this sudden mischief never could have fall n
duke of alencon this was your default that being captain of the watch to night did look no better to that weighty charge
had all your quarters been as safely kept as that whereof i had the government we had not been thus shamefully surpris d
and so was mine my lord
and for myself most part of all this night within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employ d in passing to and fro about relieving of the sentinels
then how or which way should they first break in
question my lords no further of the case how or which way tis sure they found some place but weakly guarded where the breach was made
and now there rests no other shift but this to gather our soldiers scatter d and dispers d and lay new platforms to endamage them
enter an english soldier crying a talbot
they fly leaving their clothes behind soldier
i ll be so bold to take what they have left
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword for i have loaden me with many spoils using no other weapon but his name
within the town enter talbot bedford burgundy a captain and others bedford
the day begins to break and night is fled whose pitchy mantle over veil d the earth
here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit
bring forth the body of old salisbury and here advance it in the market place the middle centre of this cursed town
now have i paid my vow unto his soul for every drop of blood was drawn from him there hath at least five frenchmen died to night
and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happened in revenge of him within their chiefest temple i ll erect a tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr d upon the which that every one may read shall be engrav d the sack of orleans the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france
but lords in all our bloody massacre i muse we met not with the dauphin s grace his new come champion virtuous joan of arc nor any of his false confederates
tis thought lord talbot when the fight began rous d on the sudden from their drowsy beds they did amongst the troops of armed men leap o er the walls for refuge in the field
myself as far as i could well discern for smoke and dusky vapours of the night am sure i scar d the dauphin and his trull when arm in arm they both came swiftly running like to a pair of loving turtle doves that could not live asunder day or night
after that things are set in order here we ll follow them with all the power we have
which of this princely train call ye the warlike talbot for his acts so much applauded through the realm of france
here is the talbot who would speak with him
the virtuous lady countess of auvergne with modesty admiring thy renown by me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe to visit her poor castle where she lies that she may boast she hath beheld the man whose glory fills the world with loud report
nay then i see our wars will turn into a peaceful comic sport when ladies crave to be encount red with
you may not my lord despise her gentle suit
ne er trust me then for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory yet hath a woman s kindness overrul d and therefore tell her i return great thanks and in submission will attend on her
will not your honours bear me company
no truly tis more than manners will and i have heard it said unbidden guests are often welcomest when they are gone
well then alone since there s no remedy i mean to prove this lady s courtesy
i do my lord and mean accordingly
the castle enter the countess and her porter countess
porter remember what i gave in charge and when you have done so bring the keys to me
the plot is laid if all things fall out right i shall as famous be by this exploit
as scythian tomyris by cyrus death
great is the rumour of this dreadful knight and his achievements of no less account
fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears to give their censure of these rare reports
madam according as your ladyship desir d by message crav d so is lord talbot come
is this the scourge of france
is this talbot so much fear d abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes
i see report is fabulous and false
i thought i should have seen some hercules a second hector for his grim aspect and large proportion of his strong knit limbs
alas this is a child a silly dwarf
it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp should strike such terror to his enemies
madam i have been bold to trouble you but since your ladyship is not at leisure i ll sort some other time to visit you
go ask him whither he goes
stay my lord talbot for my lady craves to know the cause of your abrupt departure
marry for that she s in a wrong belief i go to certify her talbot s here
re enter porter with keys countess
if thou be he then art thou prisoner
to me blood thirsty lord and for that cause i train d thee to my house
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me for in my gallery thy picture hangs but now the substance shall endure the like and i will chain these legs and arms of thine that hast by tyranny these many years wasted our country slain our citizens and sent our sons and husbands captivate
thy mirth shall turn to moan
i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot s shadow whereon to practise your severity
why art not thou the man
no no i am but shadow of myself
you are deceiv d my substance is not here for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity
i tell you madam were the whole frame here it is of such a spacious lofty pitch your roof were not sufficient to contain t
this is a riddling merchant for the nonce he will be here and yet he is not here
that will i show you presently
winds his horn drums strike up a peal of ordnance
enter soldiers how say you madam
are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself
these are his substance sinews arms and strength with which he yoketh your rebellious necks razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate
i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited and more than may be gathered by thy shape
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath for i am sorry that with reverence i did not entertain thee as thou art
be not dismay d fair lady nor misconster the mind of talbot as you did mistake the outward composition of his body
what you have done hath not offended me
nor other satisfaction do i crave but only with your patience that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have for soldiers stomachs always serve them well
with all my heart and think me honoured to feast so great a warrior in my house
the temple garden enter the earls of somerset suffolk and warwick richard plantagenet vernon and another lawyer plantagenet
great lords and gentlemen what means this silence
dare no man answer in a case of truth
within the temple hall we were too loud the garden here is more convenient
then say at once if i maintain d the truth or else was wrangling somerset in th error
faith i have been a truant in the law and never yet could frame my will to it and therefore frame the law unto my will
judge you my lord of warwick then between us
between two hawks which flies the higher pitch between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth between two blades which bears the better temper between two horses which doth bear him best between two girls which hath the merriest eye i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment but in these nice sharp quillets of the law good faith i am no wiser than a daw
tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out
and on my side it is so well apparell d so clear so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind man s eye
since you are tongue tied and so loath to speak in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
let him that is a true born gentleman and stands upon the honour of his birth if he suppose that i have pleaded truth from off this brier pluck a white rose with me
let him that is no coward nor no flatterer but dare maintain the party of the truth pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
i love no colours and without all colour of base insinuating flattery i pluck this white rose with plantagenet
i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right
stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are cropp d from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion
good master vernon it is well objected if i have fewest i subscribe in silence
then for the truth and plainness of the case i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here giving my verdict on the white rose side
prick not your finger as you pluck it off lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red and fall on my side so against your will
if i my lord for my opinion bleed opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am
well well come on who else
to somerset unless my study and my books be false the argument you held was wrong in you in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too
now somerset where is your argument
here in my scabbard meditating that shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses for pale they look with fear as witnessing the truth on our side
no plantagenet tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
hath not thy rose a canker somerset
hath not thy rose a thorn plantagenet
ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
well i ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses that shall maintain what i have said is true where false plantagenet dare not be seen
now by this maiden blossom in my hand i scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
turn not thy scorns this way plantagenet
proud pole i will and scorn both him and thee
i ll turn my part thereof into thy throat
away away good william de la pole
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him
now by god s will thou wrong st him somerset his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence third son to the third edward king of england
spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
he bears him on the place s privilege or durst not for his craven heart say thus
by him that made me i ll maintain my words on any plot of ground in christendom
was not thy father richard earl of cambridge for treason executed in our late king s days
and by his treason stand st not thou attainted corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood and till thou be restor d thou art a yeoman
my father was attached not attainted condemn d to die for treason but no traitor and that i ll prove on better men than somerset were growing time once ripened to my will
for your partaker pole and you yourself i ll note you in my book of memory to scourge you for this apprehension
look to it well and say you are well warn d
ay thou shalt find us ready for thee still and know us by these colours for thy foes for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
and by my soul this pale and angry rose as cognizance of my blood drinking hate will i for ever and my faction wear until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree
go forward and be chok d with thy ambition
and so farewell until i meet thee next
how i am brav d and must perforce endure it
this blot that they object against your house shall be wip d out in the next parliament call d for the truce of winchester and gloucester and if thou be not then created york i will not live to be accounted warwick
meantime in signal of my love to thee against proud somerset and william pole will i upon thy party wear this rose and here i prophesy this brawl to day grown to this faction in the temple garden shall send between the red rose and the white a thousand souls to death and deadly night
good master vernon i am bound to you that you on my behalf would pluck a flower
in your behalf still will i wear the same
come let us four to dinner
i dare say this quarrel will drink blood another day
the tower of london enter mortimer brought in a chair and gaolers mortimer
kind keepers of my weak decaying age let dying mortimer here rest himself
even like a man new haled from the rack so fare my limbs with long imprisonment and these grey locks the pursuivants of death nestor like aged in an age of care argue the end of edmund mortimer
these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent wax dim as drawing to their exigent weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief and pithless arms like to a withered vine that droops his sapless branches to the ground
yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb unable to support this lump of clay swift winged with desire to get a grave as witting i no other comfort have
but tell me keeper will my nephew come
richard plantagenet my lord will come
we sent unto the temple unto his chamber and answer was return d that he will come
enough my soul shall then be satisfied
since henry monmouth first began to reign before whose glory i was great in arms this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscur d depriv d of honour and inheritance
but now the arbitrator of despairs just death kind umpire of men s miseries with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
i would his troubles likewise were expir d that so he might recover what was lost
my lord your loving nephew now is come
richard plantagenet my friend is he come
ay noble uncle thus ignobly us d your nephew late despised richard comes
direct mine arms i may embrace his neck and in his bosom spend my latter gasp
o tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks that i may kindly give one fainting kiss
and now declare sweet stem from york s great stock why didst thou say of late thou wert despis d
first lean thine aged back against mine arm and in that ease i ll tell thee my disease
this day in argument upon a case some words there grew twixt somerset and me among which terms he us d his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my father s death which obloquy set bars before my tongue else with the like i had requited him
therefore good uncle for my father s sake in honour of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake declare the cause my father earl of cambridge lost his head
that cause fair nephew that imprison d me and hath detain d me all my flow ring youth within a loathsome dungeon there to pine was cursed instrument of his decease
discover more at large what cause that was for i am ignorant and cannot guess
i will if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done
henry the fourth grandfather to this king depos d his nephew richard edward s son the first begotten and the lawful heir of edward king the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north finding his usurpation most unjust endeavour d my advancement to the throne
the reason mov d these warlike lords to this was for that young richard thus remov d leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence third son to king edward the third whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree being but fourth of that heroic line
but mark as in this haughty great attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir i lost my liberty and they their lives
long after this when henry the fifth succeeding his father bolingbroke did reign thy father earl of cambridge then deriv d from famous edmund langley duke of york marrying my sister that thy mother was again in pity of my hard distress levied an army weening to redeem and have install d me in the diadem but as the rest so fell that noble earl and was beheaded
thus the mortimers in whom the title rested were suppress d
of which my lord your honour is the last
true and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death
thou art my heir the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care
thy grave admonishments prevail with me
but yet methinks my father s execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny
with silence nephew be thou politic strong fixed is the house of lancaster and like a mountain not to be remov d
but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts when they are cloy d with long continuance in a settled place
o uncle would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age
thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill
mourn not except thou sorrow for my good only give order for my funeral
and so farewell and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war
and peace no war befall thy parting soul
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpass d thy days
well i will lock his counsel in my breast and what i do imagine let that rest
keepers convey him hence and i myself will see his burial better than his life
exeunt gaolers hearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer chok d with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs those bitter injuries which somerset hath offer d to my house i doubt not but with honour to redress and therefore haste i to the parliament either to be restored to my blood or make my ill th advantage of my good
enter the king exeter gloucester warwick somerset and suffolk the bishop of winchester richard plantagenet and others
gloucester offers to put up a bill winchester snatches it and tears it winchester
com st thou with deep premeditated lines with written pamphlets studiously devis d
humphrey of gloucester if thou canst accuse or aught intend st to lay unto my charge do it without invention suddenly i with sudden and extemporal speech purpose to answer what thou canst object
presumptuous priest this place commands my patience or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour d me
think not although in writing i preferr d the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes that therefore i have forg d or am not able verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
no prelate such is thy audacious wickedness thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks as very infants prattle of thy pride
thou art a most pernicious usurer froward by nature enemy to peace lascivious wanton more than well beseems a man of thy profession and degree and for thy treachery what s more manifest in that thou laid st a trap to take my life as well at london bridge as at the tower
beside i fear me if thy thoughts were sifted the king thy sovereign is not quite exempt from envious malice of thy swelling heart
lords vouchsafe to give me hearing what i shall reply
if i were covetous ambitious or perverse as he will have me how am i so poor
or how haps it i seek not to advance or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
and for dissension who preferreth peace more than i do except i be provok d
no my good lords it is not that offends it is not that that incens d hath incens d the duke it is because no one should sway but he no one but he should be about the king and that engenders thunder in his breast and makes him roar these accusations forth
but he shall know i am as good gloucester
ay lordly sir for what are you i pray but one imperious in another s throne
am i not protector saucy priest
and am not i a prelate of the church
yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps and useth it to patronage his theft
thou art reverend touching thy spiritual function not thy life
my lord it were your duty to forbear
ay see the bishop be not overborne
methinks my lord should be religious and know the office that belongs to such
methinks his lordship should be humbler it fitteth not a prelate so to plead
yes when his holy state is touch d so near
state holy or unhallow d what of that
is not his grace protector to the king
aside plantagenet i see must hold his tongue lest it be said speak sirrah when you should must your bold verdict enter talk with lords
else would i have a fling at winchester
uncles of gloucester and of winchester the special watchmen of our english weal i would prevail if prayers might prevail to join your hearts in love and amity
o what a scandal is it to our crown that two such noble peers as ye should jar
believe me lords my tender years can tell civil dissension is a viperous worm that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
a noise within down with the tawny coats
an uproar i dare warrant begun through malice of the bishop s men
enter the mayor of london attended mayor
o my good lords and virtuous henry pity the city of london pity us
the bishop and the duke of gloucester s men forbidden late to carry any weapon have fill d their pockets full of pebble stones and banding themselves in contrary parts do pelt so fast at one another s pate that many have their giddy brains knock d out
our windows are broke down in every street and we for fear compell d to shut our shops
enter in skirmish the retainers of gloucester and winchester with bloody pates king henry
we charge you on allegiance to ourself to hold your slaught ring hands and keep the peace
pray uncle gloucester mitigate this strife
nay if we be forbidden stones we ll fall to it with our teeth
do what ye dare we are as resolute
you of my household leave this peevish broil and set this unaccustom d fight aside
my lord we know your grace to be a man just and upright and for your royal birth inferior to none but to his majesty and ere that we will suffer such a prince so kind a father of the commonweal to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate we and our wives and children all will fight and have our bodies slaught red by thy foes
ay and the very parings of our nails shall pitch a field when we are dead
and if you love me as you say you do let me persuade you to forbear awhile
o how this discord doth afflict my soul
can you my lord of winchester behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent
who should be pitiful if you be not
or who should study to prefer a peace if holy churchmen take delight in broils
yield my lord protector yield winchester except you mean with obstinate repulse to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
you see what mischief and what murder too hath been enacted through your enmity then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
he shall submit or i will never yield
compassion on the king commands me stoop or i would see his heart out ere the priest should ever get that privilege of me
behold my lord of winchester the duke hath banish d moody discontented fury as by his smoothed brows it doth appear why look you still so stem and tragical
here winchester i offer thee my hand
i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin and will not you maintain the thing you teach but prove a chief offender in the same
the bishop hath a kindly gird
for shame my lord of winchester relent what shall a child instruct you what to do
well duke of gloucester i will yield to thee love for thy love and hand for hand i give
gloucester aside ay but i fear me with a hollow heart
see here my friends and loving countrymen this token serveth for a flag of truce betwixt ourselves and all our followers
so help me god as i dissemble not
winchester aside so help me god as i intend it not
o loving uncle kind duke of gloucester how joyful am i made by this contract
trouble us no more but join in friendship as your lords have done
content i ll to the surgeon s
and i will see what physic the tavern affords
accept this scroll most gracious sovereign which in the right of richard plantagenet we do exhibit to your majesty
well urg d my lord of warwick for sweet prince an if your grace mark every circumstance you have great reason to do richard right especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty
and those occasions uncle were of force therefore my loving lords our pleasure is that richard be restored to his blood
let richard be restored to his blood so shall his father s wrongs be recompens d
as will the rest so willeth winchester
if richard will be true not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york from whence you spring by lineal descent
thy humble servant vows obedience and humble service till the point of death
stoop then and set your knee against my foot and in reguerdon of that duty done i girt thee with the valiant sword of york
rise richard like a true plantagenet and rise created princely duke of york
and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall
and as my duty springs so perish they that grudge one thought against your majesty
welcome high prince the mighty duke of york
aside perish base prince ignoble duke of york
now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crown d in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends as it disanimates his enemies
when gloucester says the word king henry goes for friendly counsel cuts off many foes
your ships already are in readiness
ay we may march in england or in france not seeing what is likely to ensue
this late dissension grown betwixt the peers burns under feigned ashes of forg d love and will at last break out into a flame as fest red members rot but by degree till bones and flesh and sinews fall away so will this base and envious discord breed
and now i fear that fatal prophecy
which in the time of henry nam d the fifth was in the mouth of every sucking babe that henry born at monmouth should win all and henry born at windsor should lose all
which is so plain that exeter doth wish his days may finish ere that hapless time
before rouen enter la pucelle disguis d with four soldiers dressed like countrymen with sacks upon their backs pucelle
these are the city gates the gates of rouen through which our policy must make a breach
take heed be wary how you place your words talk like the vulgar sort of market men that come to gather money for their corn
if we have entrance as i hope we shall and that we find the slothful watch but weak i ll by a sign give notice to our friends that charles the dauphin may encounter them
our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city and we be lords and rulers over rouen therefore we ll knock
paysans pauvres gens de france poor market folks that come to sell their corn
enter go in the market bell is rung
now rouen i ll shake thy bulwarks to the ground
la pucelle c enter the town enter charles bastard alencon reignier and forces charles
saint denis bless this happy stratagem
and once again we ll sleep secure in rouen
here ent red pucelle and her practisants now she is there how will she specify here is the best and safest passage in
by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower which once discern d shows that her meaning is no way to that for weakness which she ent red
enter la pucelle on the top thrusting out a torch burning pucelle
behold this is the happy wedding torch that joineth rouen unto her countrymen but burning fatal to the talbotites
see noble charles the beacon of our friend the burning torch in yonder turret stands
now shine it like a comet of revenge a prophet to the fall of all our foes
defer no time delays have dangerous ends enter and cry the dauphin
presently and then do execution on the watch
enter talbot in an excursion talbot
france thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears if talbot but survive thy treachery
pucelle that witch that damned sorceress hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares that hardly we escap d the pride of france
bedford brought in sick in a chair
enter talbot and burgundy without within la pucelle charles bastard alencon and reignier on the walls pucelle
i think the duke of burgundy will fast before he ll buy again at such a rate
twas full of darnel do you like the taste
scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan
i trust ere long to choke thee with thine own and make thee curse the harvest of that corn
your grace may starve perhaps before that time
o let no words but deeds revenge this treason
what you do good grey beard
break a lance and run a tilt at death within a chair
foul fiend of france and hag of all despite encompass d with thy lustful paramours becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age and twit with cowardice a man half dead
damsel i ll have a bout with you again or else let talbot perish with this shame
yet pucelle hold thy peace if talbot do but thunder rain will follow
the english party whisper together in council god speed the parliament
dare ye come forth and meet us in the field
belike your lordship takes us then for fools to try if that our own be ours or no
i speak not to that railing hecate but unto thee alencon and the rest
will ye like soldiers come and fight it out
like peasant foot boys do they keep the walls and dare not take up arms like gentlemen
let s get us from the walls for talbot means no goodness by his looks
god b uy my lord we came but to tell you that we are here
and there will we be too ere it be long or else reproach be talbot s greatest fame
vow burgundy by honour of thy house prick d on by public wrongs sustain d in france either to get the town again or die and i as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror as sure as in this late betrayed town great coeur de lion s heart was buried so sure i swear to get the town or die
my vows are equal partners with thy vows
but ere we go regard this dying prince the valiant duke of bedford
come my lord we will bestow you in some better place fitter for sickness and for crazy age
lord talbot do not so dishonour me here will i sit before the walls of rouen and will be partner of your weal or woe
courageous bedford let us now persuade you
not to be gone from hence for once i read that stout pendragon in his litter sick came to the field and vanquished his foes
methinks i should revive the soldiers hearts because i ever found them as myself
undaunted spirit in a dying breast
and now no more ado brave burgundy but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy
exeunt against the town all but bedford and attendants an alarum excursions
enter sir john fastolfe and a captain captain
whither away sir john fastolfe in such haste
to save myself by flight we are like to have the overthrow again
will you and leave lord talbot
ay all the talbots in the world to save my life
exit into the town retreat excursions
la pucelle alencon and charles fly bedford
now quiet soul depart when heaven please for i have seen our enemies overthrow
what is the trust or strength of foolish man
they that of late were daring with their scoffs are glad and fain by flight to save themselves
bedford dies and is carried in by two in his chair an alarum
re enter talbot burgundy and the rest talbot
lost and recovered in a day again
this is a double honour burgundy
yet heavens have glory for this victory
warlike and martial talbot burgundy enshrines thee in his heart and there erects thy noble deeds as valour s monuments
i think her old familiar is asleep
now where s the bastard s braves and charles his gleeks
rouen hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled
now will we take some order in the town placing therein some expert officers and then depart to paris to the king for there young henry with his nobles lie
but yet before we go let s not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceas d but see his exequies fulfill d in rouen
a braver soldier never couched lance a gentler heart did never sway in court but kings and mightiest potentates must die for that s the end of human misery
the plains near rouen enter charles the bastard alencon la pucelle and forces pucelle
dismay not princes at this accident nor grieve that rouen is so recovered
care is no cure but rather corrosive for things that are not to be remedied
let frantic talbot triumph for a while and like a peacock sweep along his tail we ll pull his plumes and take away his train if dauphin and the rest will be but rul d
we have guided by thee hitherto and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust bastard
search out thy wit for secret policies and we will make thee famous through the world
we ll set thy statue in some holy place and have thee reverenc d like a blessed saint
employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
then thus it must be this doth joan devise by fair persuasions mix d with sug red words we will entice the duke of burgundy to leave the talbot and to follow us
ay marry sweeting if we could do that france were no place for henry s warriors nor should that nation boast it so with us but be extirped from our provinces
for ever should they be expuls d from france and not have tide of an earldom here
your honours shall perceive how i will work to bring this matter to the wished end
by the sound of drum you may perceive their powers are marching unto paris ward
enter and pass over at a distance talbot and his forces there goes the talbot with his colours spread and all the troops of english after him
enter the duke of burgundy and his forces now in the rearward comes the duke and his
fortune in favour makes him lag behind
summon a parley we will talk with him
a parley with the duke of burgundy
who craves a parley with the burgundy
the princely charles of france thy countryman
speak pucelle and enchant him with thy words
brave burgundy undoubted hope of france
stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee
speak on but be not over tedious
look on thy country look on fertile france and see the cities and the towns defac d by wasting ruin of the cruel foe as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes see see the pining malady of france behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast
o turn thy edged sword another way strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
one drop of blood drawn from thy country s bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
return thee therefore with a flood of tears and wash away thy country s stained spots
either she hath bewitch d me with her words or nature makes me suddenly relent
besides all french and france exclaims on thee doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
who join st thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profit s sake
when talbot hath set footing once in france and fashion d thee that instrument of ill who then but english henry will be lord and thou be thrust out like a fugitive
call we to mind and mark but this for proof was not the duke of orleans thy foe
and was he not in england prisoner
but when they heard he was thine enemy they set him free without his ransom paid in spite of burgundy and all his friends
see then thou fight st against thy countrymen and join st with them will be thy slaughtermen
come come return return thou wandering lord charles and the rest will take thee in their arms
i am vanquished these haughty words of hers have batt red me like roaring cannon shot and made me almost yield upon my knees
forgive me country and sweet countrymen and lords accept this hearty kind embrace
my forces and my power of men are yours so farewell talbot i ll no longer trust thee
done like a frenchman aside turn and turn again
and doth beget new courage in our breasts
pucelle hath bravely play d her part in this and doth deserve a coronet of gold
now let us on my lords and join our powers and seek how we may prejudice the foe
the palace enter the king gloucester winchester york suffolk somerset warwick exeter vernon basset and others
to them with his soldiers talbot talbot
my gracious prince and honourable peers hearing of your arrival in this realm i have awhile given truce unto my wars to do my duty to my sovereign in sign whereof this arm that hath reclaim d to your obedience fifty fortresses twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength beside five hundred prisoners of esteem lets fall his sword before your highness feet and with submissive loyalty of heart ascribes the glory of his conquest got first to my god and next unto your grace
is this the lord talbot uncle gloucester that hath so long been resident in france
yes if it please your majesty my liege
welcome brave captain and victorious lord
when i was young as yet i am not old i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword
long since we were resolved of your truth your faithful service and your toil in war yet never have you tasted our reward or been reguerdon d with so much as thanks because till now we never saw your face
therefore stand up and for these good deserts we here create you earl of shrewsbury and in our coronation take your place
exeunt all but vernon and basset vernon
now sir to you that were so hot at sea disgracing of these colours that i wear in honour of my noble lord of york dar st thou maintain the former words thou spak st
yes sir as well as you dare patronage the envious barking of your saucy tongue against my lord the duke of somerset
sirrah thy lord i honour as he is
as good a man as york
villain thou knowest the law of arms is such that whoso draws a sword tis present death or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood
but i ll unto his majesty and crave i may have liberty to venge this wrong when thou shalt see i ll meet thee to thy cost
well miscreant i ll be there as soon as you and after meet you sooner than you would
the palace enter the king gloucester winchester york suffolk somerset warwick talbot exeter the governor of paris and others gloucester
lord bishop set the crown upon his head
god save king henry of that name the sixth
now governor of paris take your oath governor kneels that you elect no other king but him esteem none friends but such as are his friends and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practices against his state
this shall ye do so help you righteous god
exeunt governor and his train enter sir john fastolfe fastolfe
my gracious sovereign as i rode from calais to haste unto your coronation a letter was deliver d to my hands writ to your grace from th duke of burgundy
shame to the duke of burgundy and thee
i vow d base knight when i did meet thee next to tear the garter from thy craven s leg plucking it off which i have done because unworthily thou wast installed in that high degree
pardon me princely henry and the rest this dastard at the battle of patay when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one before we met or that a stroke was given like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surpris d and taken prisoners
then judge great lords if i have done amiss or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood yea or no
to say the truth this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man much more a knight a captain and a leader
when first this order was ordain d my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes
he then that is not furnish d in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honourable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedge born swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood
stain to thy countrymen thou hear st thy doom
be packing therefore thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
exit fastolfe and now my lord protector view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy
viewing the superscription what means his grace that he hath chang d his style
no more but plain and bluntly to the king
hath he forgot he is his sovereign
or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will
reads i have upon especial cause mov d with compassion of my country s wreck together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon forsaken your pernicious faction and join d with charles the rightful king of france
can this be so that in alliance amity and oaths there should be found such false dissembling guile
he doth my lord and is become your foe
is that the worst this letter doth contain
it is the worst and all my lord he writes
why then lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse
how say you my lord are you not content
yes but that i am prevented i should have begg d i might have been employ d
then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
and what offence it is to flout his friends
i go my lord in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes
exit enter vernon and basset vernon
grant me the combat gracious sovereign
and me my lord grant me the combat too
this is my servant hear him noble prince
and this is mine sweet henry favour him
be patient lords and give them leave to speak
say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim and wherefore crave you combat or with whom
with him my lord for he hath done me wrong
and i with him for he hath done me wrong
what is that wrong whereof you both complain
first let me know and then i ll answer you
crossing the sea from england into france this fellow here with envious carping tongue upbraided me about the rose i wear saying the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my master s blushing cheeks when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argu d betwixt the duke of york and him with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lord s worthiness i crave the benefit of law of arms
and that is my petition noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent yet know my lord i was provok d by him and he first took exceptions at this badge pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewray d the faintness of my master s heart
will not this malice somerset be left
your private grudge my lord of york will out though ne er so cunningly you smother it
good lord what madness rules in brainsick men when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise
good cousins both of york and somerset quiet yourselves i pray and be at peace
let this dissension first be tried by fight and then your highness shall command a peace
the quarrel toucheth none but us alone betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
there is my pledge accept it somerset
nay let it rest where it began at first
confirm it so mine honourable lord
confounded be your strife and perish ye with your audacious prate
presumptuous vassals are you not asham d with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us
and you my lords methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
let me persuade you take a better course
come hither you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you as you love our favour quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
and you my lords remember where we are in france amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree how will their grudging stomachs be provok d to wilful disobedience and rebel
beside what infamy will there arise when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy a thing of no regard king henry s peers and chief nobility destroy d themselves and lost the realm of france
o think upon the conquest of my father my tender years and let us not forgo that for a trifle that was bought with blood
let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
i see no reason if i wear this rose putting on a red rose that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen and i love them both
as well they may upbraid me with my crown because forsooth the king of scots is crown d
but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore as we hither came in peace so let us still continue peace and love
cousin of york we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france
and good my lord of somerset unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot and like true subjects sons of your progenitors go cheerfully together and digest your angry choler on your enemies
ourself my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to calais from thence to england where i hope ere long to be presented by your victories with charles alencon and that traitorous rout
exeunt all but york warwick exeter vernon warwick
my lord of york i promise you the king prettily methought did play the orator
and so he did but yet i like it not in that he wears the badge of somerset
tush that was but his fancy blame him not i dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
an if i wist he did but let it rest other affairs must now be managed
well didst thou richard to suppress thy voice for had the passions of thy heart burst out i fear we should have seen decipher d there more rancorous spite more furious raging broils than yet can be imagin d or suppos d
but howsoe er no simple man that sees this jarring discord of nobility this shouldering of each other in the court this factious bandying of their favourites but that it doth presage some ill event
tis much when sceptres are in children s hands but more when envy breeds unkind division there comes the ruin there begins confusion
before bordeaux enter talbot with trump and drum talbot
go to the gates of bordeaux trumpeter summon their general unto the wall
thou ominous and fearful owl of death our nation s terror and their bloody scourge
the period of thy tyranny approacheth
on us thou canst not enter but by death for i protest we are well fortified and strong enough to issue out and fight
if thou retire the dauphin well appointed stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch d to wall thee from the liberty of flight and no way canst thou turn thee for redress but death doth front thee with apparent spoil and pale destruction meets thee in the face
ten thousand french have ta en the sacrament to rive their dangerous artillery upon no christian soul but english talbot
lo there thou stand st a breathing valiant man of an invincible unconquer d spirit
this is the latest glory of thy praise that i thy enemy due thee withal for ere the glass that now begins to run finish the process of his sandy hour these eyes that see thee now well coloured shall see thee withered bloody pale and dead
the dauphin s drum a warning bell sings heavy music to thy timorous soul and mine shall ring thy dire departure out
he fables not i hear the enemy
out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
how are we park d and bounded in a pale a little herd of england s timorous deer maz d with a yelping kennel of french curs
if we be english deer be then in blood not rascal like to fall down with a pinch but rather moody mad and desperate stags turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel and make the cowards stand aloof at bay
sell every man his life as dear as mine and they shall find dear deer of us my friends
god and saint george talbot and england s right prosper our colours in this dangerous fight
plains in gascony enter york with trumpet and many soldiers
are not the speedy scouts return d again that dogg d the mighty army of the dauphin
they are return d my lord and give it out that he is march d to bordeaux with his power to fight with talbot as he march d along by your espials were discovered two mightier troops than that the dauphin led which join d with him and made their march for bordeaux
a plague upon that villain somerset that thus delays my promised supply of horsemen that were levied for this siege
renowned talbot doth expect my aid and i am louted by a traitor villain and cannot help the noble chevalier
god comfort him in this necessity
if he miscarry farewell wars in france
thou princely leader of our english strength never so needful on the earth of france spur to the rescue of the noble talbot who now is girdled with a waist of iron and hemm d about with grim destruction
else farewell talbot france and england s honour
o god that somerset who in proud heart doth stop my cornets were in talbot s place
so should we save a valiant gentleman by forfeiting a traitor and a coward
mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep that thus we die while remiss traitors sleep
o send some succour to the distress d lord
he dies we lose i break my warlike word
we lose they daily get all long of this vile traitor somerset
then god take mercy on brave talbot s soul and on his son young john who two hours since i met in travel toward his warlike father
this seven years did not talbot see his son and now they meet where both their lives are done
alas what joy shall noble talbot have to bid his young son welcome to his grave
vexation almost stops my breath that sund red friends greet in the hour of death
lucy farewell no more my fortune can but curse the cause i cannot aid the man
maine blois poictiers and tours are won away long all of somerset and his delay
thus while the vulture of sedition feeds in the bosom of such great commanders sleeping neglection doth betray to loss the conquest of our scarce cold conqueror that ever living man of memory henry the fifth
whiles they each other cross lives honours lands and all hurry to loss
other plains of gascony enter somerset with his forces an officer of talbot s with him somerset
it is too late i cannot send them now
this expedition was by york and talbot too rashly plotted all our general force might with a sally of the very town be buckled with
the over daring talbot hath sullied all his gloss of former honour by this unheedful desperate wild adventure
york set him on to fight and die in shame
that talbot dead great york might bear the name
here is sir william lucy who with me set from our o er match d forces forth for aid
from bought and sold lord talbot who ring d about with bold adversity cries out for noble york and somerset to beat assailing death from his weak legions and whiles the honourable captain there drops bloody sweat from his war wearied limbs and in advantage ling ring looks for rescue you his false hopes the trust of england s honour keep off aloof with worthless emulation
let not your private discord keep away the levied succours that should lend him aid while he renowned noble gentleman yield up his life unto a world of odds
orleans the bastard charles burgundy alencon reignier compass him about and talbot perisheth by your default
york set him on york should have sent him aid
and york as fast upon your grace exclaims swearing that you withhold his levied host collected for this expedition
york lies he might have sent and had the horse
i owe him little duty and less love and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending
the fraud of england not the force of france hath now entrapp d the noble minded talbot
never to england shall he bear his life but dies betray d to fortune by your strife
come go i will dispatch the horsemen straight within six hours they will be at his aid
too late comes rescue he is ta en or slain for fly he could not if he would have fled and fly would talbot never though he might
if he be dead brave talbot then adieu
his fame lives in the world his shame in you
the english camp near bordeaux enter talbot and john his son talbot
i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war that talbot s name might be in thee reviv d when sapless age and weak unable limbs should bring thy father to his drooping chair
but o malignant and ill boding stars
now thou art come unto a feast of death a terrible and unavoided danger therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse and i ll direct thee how thou shalt escape by sudden flight
is my name talbot and am i your son
o if you love my mother dishonour not her honourable name to make a bastard and a slave of me
the world will say he is not talbot s blood that basely fled when noble talbot stood
fly to revenge my death if i be slain
he that flies so will ne er return again
if we both stay we both are sure to die
then let me stay and father do you fly
your loss is great so your regard should be my worth unknown no loss is known in me upon my death the french can little boast in yours they will in you all hopes are lost
flight cannot stain the honour you have won but mine it will that no exploit have done you fled for vantage every one will swear but if i bow they ll say it was for fear
there is no hope that ever i will stay if the first hour i shrink and run away
here on my knee i beg mortality rather than life preserv d with infamy
shall all thy mother s hopes lie in one tomb
ay rather than i ll shame my mother s womb
upon my blessing i command thee go
to fight i will but not to fly the foe
part of thy father may be sav d in thee
no part of him but will be shame in me
thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
thy father s charge shall clear thee from that stain
you cannot witness for me being slain
if death be so apparent then both fly
and leave my followers here to fight and die
my age was never tainted with such shame
and shall my youth be guilty of such blame
no more can i be severed from your side than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide
stay go do what you will the like do i for live i will not if my father die
then here i take my leave of thee fair son born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
come side by side together live and die and soul with soul from france to heaven fly
a field of battle alarum excursions wherein john talbot is hemm d about and talbot rescues him talbot
the regent hath with talbot broke his word and left us to the rage of france his sword
pause and take thy breath i gave thee life and rescu d thee from death
o twice my father twice am i thy son
the life thou gav st me first was lost and done till with thy warlike sword despite of fate to my determin d time thou gav st new date
when from the dauphin s crest thy sword struck fire it warm d thy father s heart with proud desire of bold fac d victory
then leaden age quicken d with youthful spleen and warlike rage beat down alencon orleans burgundy and from the pride of gallia rescued thee
the ireful bastard orleans that drew blood from thee my boy and had the maidenhood of thy first fight i soon encountered and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood and in disgrace bespoke him thus contaminated base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine which thou didst force from talbot my brave boy
here purposing the bastard to destroy came in strong rescue
speak thy father s care art thou not weary john
wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly now thou art seal d the son of chivalry
fly to revenge my death when i am dead the help of one stands me in little stead
o too much folly is it well i wot to hazard all our lives in one small boat
if i to day die not with frenchmen s rage to morrow i shall die with mickle age
by me they nothing gain an if i stay tis but the short ning of my life one day
in thee thy mother dies our household s name my death s revenge thy youth and england s fame
all these and more we hazard by thy stay all these are sav d if thou wilt fly away
the sword of orleans hath not made me smart these words of yours draw life blood from my heart
on that advantage bought with such a shame to save a paltry life and slay bright fame before young talbot from old talbot fly the coward horse that bears me fall and die
and like me to the peasant boys of france to be shame s scorn and subject of mischance
surely by all the glory you have won an if i fly i am not talbot s son then talk no more of flight it is no boot if son to talbot die at talbot s foot
then follow thou thy desp rate sire of crete thou icarus thy life to me is sweet
if thou wilt fight fight by thy father s side and commendable prov d let s die in pride
another part of the field alarum excursions
enter old talbot led by a servant talbot
triumphant death smear d with captivity young talbot s valour makes me smile at thee
when he perceiv d me shrink and on my knee his bloody sword he brandish d over me and like a hungry lion did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience but when my angry guardant stood alone tend ring my ruin and assail d of none dizzy ey d fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clust ring battle of the french and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his overmounting spirit and there died my icarus my blossom in his pride
enter soldiers bearing the body of john talbot servant
o my dear lord lo where your son is borne
thou antic death which laugh st us here to scorn anon from thy insulting tyranny coupled in bonds of perpetuity two talbots winged through the lither sky in thy despite shall scape mortality
o thou whose wounds become hard favoured death speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath
brave death by speaking whether he will or no imagine him a frenchman and thy foe
he smiles methinks as who should say had death been french then death had died to day
come come and lay him in his father s arms
my spirit can no longer bear these harms
i have what i would have now my old arms are young john talbot s grave
dies enter charles alencon burgundy bastard la pucelle and forces charles
had york and somerset brought rescue in we should have found a bloody day of this
how the young whelp of talbot s raging wood did flesh his puny sword in frenchmen s blood
once i encount red him and thus i said thou maiden youth be vanquish d by a maid
but with a proud majestical high scorn he answer d thus young talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench
so rushing in the bowels of the french he left me proudly as unworthy fight
doubtless he would have made a noble knight
see where he lies inhearsed in the arms of the most bloody nurser of his harms
hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder whose life was england s glory gallia s wonder
for that which we have fled during the life let us not wrong it dead
enter sir william lucy attended a french herald preceding lucy
herald conduct me to the dauphin s tent to know who hath obtain d the glory of the day

is talbot slain the frenchmen s only scourge your kingdom s terror and black nemesis
o were mine eye bans into bullets turn d that i in rage might shoot them at your faces
o that i could but can these dead to life
it were enough to fright the realm of france
were but his picture left amongst you here it would amaze the proudest of you all
give me their bodies that i may bear them hence and give them burial as beseems their worth
i think this upstart is old talbot s ghost he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
for god s sake let him have them to keep them here they would but stink and putrefy the air
i ll bear them hence but from their ashes shall be rear d a phoenix that shall make all france afeard

how doth your grace affect their motion
well my good lord and as the only means to stop effusion of our christian blood and stablish quietness on every side

beside my lord the sooner to effect and surer bind this knot of amity the earl of armagnac near knit to charles a man of great authority in france proffers his only daughter to your grace in marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry

plains in anjou enter charles burgundy alencon bastard reignier la pucelle and forces charles
these news my lords may cheer our drooping spirits tis said the stout parisians do revolt and turn again unto the warlike french

they walk and speak not o hold me not with silence over long
where i was wont to feed you with my blood i ll lop a member off and give it you in earnest of a further benefit so you do condescend to help me now
they hang their heads no hope to have redress
my body shall pay recompense if you will grant my suit
they shake their heads cannot my body nor blood sacrifice entreat you to your wonted furtherance
then take my soul my body soul and all before that england give the french the foil
now the time is come that france must vail her lofty plumed crest and let her head fall into england s lap
my ancient incantations are too weak and hell too strong for me to buckle with
now france thy glory droopeth to the dust
la pucelle and york fight hand to hand la pucelle is taken
damsel of france i think i have you fast
unchain your spirits now with spelling charms and try if they can gain your liberty
a goodly prize fit for the devil s grace
see how the ugly witch doth bend her brows as if with circe she would change my shape
chang d to a worser shape thou canst not be
o charles the dauphin is a proper man no shape but his can please your dainty eye
a plaguing mischief fight on charles and thee
and may ye both be suddenly surpris d by bloody hands in sleeping on your beds
fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue
i prithee give me leave to curse awhile
curse miscreant when thou comest to the stake
enter suffolk with margaret in his hand suffolk
be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner
gazes on her o fairest beauty do not fear nor fly
for i will touch thee but with reverent hands i kiss these fingers for eternal peace and lay them gently on thy tender side
say that i may honour thee
margaret my name and daughter to a king the king of naples whosoe er thou art
an earl i am and suffolk am i call d
be not offended nature s miracle thou art allotted to be ta en by me
so doth the swan her downy cygnets save keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
yet if this servile usage once offend go and be free again as suffolk s friend
aside i have no power to let her pass my hand would free her but my heart says no
as plays the sun upon the glassy streams twinkling another counterfeited beam so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
fain would i woo her yet i dare not speak
i ll call for pen and ink and write my mind
disable not thyself hast not a tongue
is she not here thy prisoner
wilt thou be daunted at a woman s sight
ay beauty s princely majesty is such confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
say earl of suffolk if thy name be so what ransom must i pay before i pass
for i perceive i am thy prisoner
aside how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit before thou make a trial of her love
aside she s beautiful and therefore to be woo d she is a woman therefore to be won
wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no
aside fond man remember that thou hast a wife then how can margaret be thy paramour
i were best leave him for he will not hear
aside there all is marr d there lies a cooling card
he talks at random sure the man is mad
aside and yet a dispensation may be had
and yet i would that you would answer me
aside i ll win this lady margaret
tush that s a wooden thing
aside yet so my fancy may be satisfied and peace established between these realms
but there remains a scruple in that too for though her father be the king of naples duke of anjou and maine yet is he poor and our nobility will scorn the match
hear ye captain are you not at leisure
aside it shall be so disdain they ne er so much
henry is youthful and will quickly yield
madam i have a secret to reveal
aside what though i be enthrall d
he seems a knight and will not any way dishonour me
lady vouchsafe to listen what i say
aside perhaps i shall be rescu d by the french and then i need not crave his courtesy
sweet madam give me hearing in a cause margaret
women have been captivate ere now
i cry you mercy tis but quid for quo
say gentle princess would you not suppose your bondage happy to be made a queen
to be a queen in bondage is more vile than is a slave in base servility for princes should be free
and so shall you if happy england s royal king be free
why what concerns his freedom unto me
i ll undertake to make thee henry s queen to put a golden sceptre in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head if thou wilt condescend to be my margaret
i am unworthy to be henry s wife
no gentle madam i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife and have no portion in the choice myself
an if my father please i am content
then call our captains and our colours forth
and madam at your father s castle walls we ll crave a parley to confer with him
enter reignier on the walls see reignier see thy daughter prisoner
i am a soldier and unapt to weep or to exclaim on fortune s fickleness
yes there is remedy enough my lord
consent and for thy honour give consent thy daughter shall be wedded to my king whom i with pain have woo d and won thereto and this her easy held imprisonment hath gain d thy daughter princely liberty
fair margaret knows that suffolk doth not flatter face or feign
upon thy princely warrant i descend to give thee answer of thy just demand
exit reignier from the walls suffolk
and here i will expect thy coming
welcome brave earl into our territories command in anjou what your honour pleases
thanks reignier happy for so sweet a child fit to be made companion with a king
what answer makes your grace unto my suit
since thou dost deign to woo her little worth to be the princely bride of such a lord upon condition i may quietly enjoy mine own the country maine and anjou free from oppression or the stroke of war my daughter shall be henry s if he please
that is her ransom i deliver her
and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy
and i again in henry s royal name as deputy unto that gracious king give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
reignier of france i give thee kingly thanks because this is in traffic of a king
aside and yet methinks i could be well content to be mine own attorney in this case
i ll over then to england with this news and make this marriage to be solemniz d
set this diamond safe in golden palaces as it becomes
i do embrace thee as i would embrace the christian prince king henry were he here
good wishes praise and prayers shall suffolk ever have of margaret
but hark you margaret no princely commendations to my king
such commendations as becomes a maid a virgin and his servant say to him
words sweetly plac d and modestly directed
but madam i must trouble you again no loving token to his majesty
yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart never yet taint with love i send the king
that for thyself i will not so presume to send such peevish tokens to a king
but suffolk stay thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
solicit henry with her wondrous praise
bethink thee on her virtues that surmount and natural graces that extinguish art repeat their semblance often on the seas that when thou com st to kneel at henry s feet thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder
camp of the duke of york in anjou enter york warwick and others york
bring forth that sorceress condemn d to burn
enter la pucelle guarded and a shepherd shepherd
ah joan this kills thy father s heart outright
have i sought every country far and near and now it is my chance to find thee out must i behold thy timeless cruel death
ah joan sweet daughter joan i ll die with thee
i am descended of a gentler blood thou art no father nor no friend of mine
my lords an please you tis not so i did beget her all the parish knows
her mother liveth yet can testify she was the first fruit of my bach lorship
graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
this argues what her kind of life hath been wicked and vile and so her death concludes
fie joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
god knows thou art a collop of my flesh and for thy sake have i shed many a tear
deny me not i prithee gentle joan
you have suborn d this man of purpose to obscure my noble birth
tis true i gave a noble to the priest the morn that i was wedded to her mother
kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
now cursed be the time of thy nativity
i would the milk thy mother gave thee when thou suck dst her breast had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield i wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
take her away for she hath liv d too long to fill the world with vicious qualities
first let me tell you whom you have condemn d not me begotten of a shepherd swain but issued from the progeny of kings virtuous and holy chosen from above by inspiration of celestial grace to work exceeding miracles on earth
i never had to do with wicked spirits
but you that are polluted with your lusts stain d with the guiltless blood of innocents corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices because you want the grace that others have you judge it straight a thing impossible to compass wonders but by help of devils
joan of arc hath been a virgin from her tender infancy chaste and immaculate in very thought whose maiden blood thus rigorously effus d will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
and hark ye sirs because she is a maid spare for no fagots let there be enow
place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake that so her torture may be shortened
will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
then joan discover thine infirmity that warranteth by law to be thy privilege i am with child ye bloody homicides murder not then the fruit within my womb although ye hale me to a violent death
the greatest miracle that e er ye wrought is all your strict preciseness come to this
she and the dauphin have been juggling
i did imagine what would be her refuge
well go to we ll have no bastards live especially since charles must father it
you are deceiv d my child is none of his it was alencon that enjoy d my love
it dies an if it had a thousand lives
o give me leave i have deluded you
twas neither charles nor yet the duke i nam d but reignier king of naples that prevail d
i think she knows not well there were so many whom she may accuse
it s sign she hath been liberal and free
and yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
use no entreaty for it is in vain
then lead me hence with whom i leave my curse may never glorious sun reflex his beams upon the country where you make abode but darkness and the gloomy shade of death environ you till mischief and despair drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
break thou in pieces and consume to ashes thou foul accursed minister of hell
lord regent i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king
for know my lords the states of christendom mov d with remorse of these outrageous broils have earnestly implor d a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth to confer about some matter
is all our travail turn d to this effect
after the slaughter of so many peers so many captains gentlemen and soldiers that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country s benefit shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
have we not lost most part of all the towns by treason falsehood and by treachery our great progenitors had conquered
i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france
if we conclude a peace it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby
enter charles alencon bastard reignier and others charles
since lords of england it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim d in france we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be
speak winchester for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison d voice by sight of these our baleful enemies
charles and the rest it is enacted thus that in regard king henry gives consent of mere compassion and of lenity to ease your country of distressful war an suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute and submit thyself thou shalt be plac d as viceroy under him and still enjoy thy regal dignity
must he be then as shadow of himself
adorn his temples with a coronet and yet in substance and authority retain but privilege of a private man
this proffer is absurd and reasonless
tis known already that i am possess d with more than half the gallian territories and therein reverenc d for their lawful king
shall i for lucre of the rest unvanquish d detract so much from that prerogative as to be call d but viceroy of the whole
no lord ambassador i ll rather keep that which i have than coveting for more be cast from possibility of all
hast thou by secret means us d intercession to obtain a league and now the matter grows to compromise stand st thou aloof upon comparison
either accept the title thou usurp st of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert or we will plague thee with incessant wars
to charles my lord you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract
if once it be neglected ten to one we shall not find like opportunity
to charles to say the truth it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility and therefore take this compact of a truce although you break it when your pleasure serves
it shall only reserv d you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison
then swear allegiance to his majesty as thou art knight never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england thou nor thy nobles to the crown of england
charles and the rest give tokens of fealty so now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensigns let your drums be still for here we entertain a solemn peace
the palace enter suffolk in conference with the king gloucester and exeter king henry
your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonish d me
her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love s settled passions in my heart and like as rigour of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love
this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise
the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous intents to love and honour henry as her lord
and otherwise will henry ne er presume
therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england s royal queen
so should i give consent to flatter sin
you know my lord your highness is betroth d unto another lady of esteem
how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach
as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vow d to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary s odds a poor earl s daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence
why what i pray is margaret more than that
her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel
yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance
and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles
beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give
disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love
henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich
so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse
marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed
and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferr d for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace
whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king
her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link d in love
then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she
whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assur d i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts
take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown d king henry s faithful and anointed queen
for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth
be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares
and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will
and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief
ay grief i fear me both at first and last
thus suffolk hath prevail d and thus he goes as did the youthful paris once to greece with hope to find the like event in love but prosper better than the troyan did
margaret shall now be queen and rule the king but i will rule both her the king and realm
the palace flourish of trumpets then hautboys
enter the king duke humphrey of gloucester salisbury warwick and cardinal beaufort on the one side the queen suffolk york somerset and buckingham on the other suffolk
welcome queen margaret i can express no kinder sign of love than this kind kiss
o lord that lends me life lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face a world of earthly blessings to my soul if sympathy of love unite our thoughts
great king of england and my gracious lord the mutual conference that my mind hath had by day by night waking and in my dreams in courtly company or at my beads with you mine alder liefest sovereign makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms such as my wit affords and over joy of heart doth minister
her sight did ravish but her grace in speech her words y clad with wisdom s majesty makes me from wond ring fall to weeping joys such is the fulness of my heart s content
lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love
kneeling long live queen margaret england s happiness
my lord protector so it please your grace here are the articles of contracted peace between our sovereign and the french king charles for eighteen months concluded by consent
reads imprimis it is agreed between the french king charles and william de la pole marquess of suffolk ambassador for henry king of england that the said henry shall espouse the lady margaret daughter unto reignier king of naples sicilia and jerusalem and crown her queen of england ere the thirtieth of may next ensuing
item that the duchy of anjou and the county of maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father lets the paper fall king henry
pardon me gracious lord some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart and dimm d mine eyes that i can read no further
uncle of winchester i pray read on
reads item it is further agreed between them that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father and she sent over of the king of england s own proper cost and charges without having any dowry
we here create thee the first duke of suffolk and girt thee with the sword
cousin of york we here discharge your grace from being regent i th parts of france till term of eighteen months be full expir d
thanks uncle winchester gloucester york buckingham somerset salisbury and warwick we thank you all for this great favour done in entertainment to my princely queen
come let us in and with all speed provide to see her coronation be perform d
exeunt king queen and suffolk gloucester
brave peers of england pillars of the state to you duke humphrey must unload his grief your grief the common grief of all the land
did my brother henry spend his youth his valour coin and people in the wars
did he so often lodge in open field in winter s cold and summer s parching heat to conquer france his true inheritance
and did my brother bedford toil his wits to keep by policy what henry got
have you yourselves somerset buckingham brave york salisbury and victorious warwick receiv d deep scars in france and normandy
or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself with all the learned council of the realm studied so long sat in the council house early and late debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe
and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes
and shall these labours and these honours die
shall henry s conquest bedford s vigilance your deeds of war and all our counsel die
o peers of england shameful is this league
fatal this marriage cancelling your fame blotting your names from books of memory razing the characters of your renown defacing monuments of conquer d france undoing all as all had never been
nephew what means this passionate discourse this peroration with such circumstance
for france tis ours and we will keep it still
ay uncle we will keep it if we can but now it is impossible we should
suffolk the new made duke that rules the roast hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse
now by the death of him that died for all these counties were the keys of normandy
but wherefore weeps warwick my valiant son
for grief that they are past recovery for were there hope to conquer them again my sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
myself did win them both those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities that i got with wounds deliver d up again with peaceful words
for suffolk s duke may he be suffocate that dims the honour of this warlike isle
france should have torn and rent my very heart before i would have yielded to this league
i never read but england s kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own to match with her that brings no vantages
a proper jest and never heard before that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her
she should have stay d in france and starv d in france before cardinal
my lord of gloucester now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king
my lord of winchester i know your mind tis not my speeches that you do mislike but tis my presence that doth trouble ye
rancour will out proud prelate in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay we shall begin our ancient bickerings
lordings farewell and say when i am gone i prophesied france will be lost ere long
so there goes our protector in a rage
tis known to you he is mine enemy nay more an enemy unto you all and no great friend i fear me to the king
consider lords he is the next of blood and heir apparent to the english crown
had henry got an empire by his marriage and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west there s reason he should be displeas d at it
look to it lords let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
what though the common people favour him calling him humphrey the good duke of gloucester clapping their hands and crying with loud voice jesu maintain your royal excellence
with god preserve the good duke humphrey
i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector
why should he then protect our sovereign he being of age to govern of himself
cousin of somerset join you with me and all together with the duke of suffolk we ll quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat
this weighty business will not brook delay i ll to the duke of suffolk presently
cousin of buckingham though humphrey s pride and greatness of his place be grief to us yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displac d he ll be protector
or thou or i somerset will be protector despite duke humphrey or the cardinal
pride went before ambition follows him
while these do labour for their own preferment behoves it us to labour for the realm
i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman
oft have i seen the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man o th church as stout and proud as he were lord of all swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal
warwick my son the comfort of my age thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping hath won the greatest favour of the commons excepting none but good duke humphrey
and brother york thy acts in ireland in bringing them to civil discipline thy late exploits done in the heart of france when thou wert regent for our sovereign have made thee fear d and honour d of the people join we together for the public good in what we can to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal with somerset s and buckingham s ambition and as we may cherish duke humphrey s deeds while they do tend the profit of the land
so god help warwick as he loves the land and common profit of his country
and so says york aside for he hath greatest cause
then let s make haste away and look unto the main
o father maine is lost that maine which by main force warwick did win and would have kept so long as breath did last
main chance father you meant but i meant maine which i will win from france or else be slain
anjou and maine are given to the french paris is lost the state of normandy stands on a tickle point now they are gone
suffolk concluded on the articles the peers agreed and henry was well pleas d to changes two dukedoms for a duke s fair daughter
i cannot blame them all what is t to them
tis thine they give away and not their own
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans still revelling like lords till all be gone while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof while all is shar d and all is borne away ready to starve and dare not touch his own
so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue while his own lands are bargain d for and sold
methinks the realms of england france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burnt unto the prince s heart of calydon
anjou and maine both given unto the french
cold news for me for i had hope of france even as i have of fertile england s soil
a day will come when york shall claim his own and therefore i will take the nevils parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey and when i spy advantage claim the crown for that s the golden mark i seek to hit
nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist nor wear the diadem upon his head whose church like humours fits not for a crown
the duke of gloucester s house enter duke and his wife eleanor duchess
why droops my lord like over ripen d corn hanging the head at ceres plenteous load
why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows as frowning at the favours of the world
why are thine eyes fix d to the sullen earth gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
king henry s diadem enchas d with all the honours of the world
if so gaze on and grovel on thy face until thy head be circled with the same
put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
i ll lengthen it with mine and having both together heav d it up we ll both together lift our heads to heaven and never more abase our sight so low as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
o nell sweet nell if thou dost love thy lord banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
and may that thought when i imagine ill against my king and nephew virtuous henry be my last breathing in this mortal world
my troublous dreams this night doth make me sad
tell me and i ll requite it with sweet rehearsal of my morning s dream
methought this staff mine office badge in court was broke in twain by whom i have forgot but as i think it was by th cardinal and on the pieces of the broken wand were plac d the heads of edmund duke of somerset and william de la pole first duke of suffolk
this was my dream what it doth bode god knows
tut this was nothing but an argument that he that breaks a stick of gloucester s grove shall lose his head for his presumption
but list to me my humphrey my sweet duke methought i sat in seat of majesty in the cathedral church of westminster and in that chair where kings and queens were crown d where henry and dame margaret kneel d to me and on my head did set the diadem
nay eleanor then must i chide outright
presumptuous dame ill nurtur d eleanor
art thou not second woman in the realm and the protector s wife belov d of him
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command above the reach or compass of thy thought
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery to tumble down thy husband and thyself from top of honour to disgrace s feet
away from me and let me hear no more
are you so choleric with eleanor for telling but her dream
next time i ll keep my dreams unto myself and not be check d
nay be not angry i am pleas d again
my lord protector tis his highness pleasure you do prepare to ride unto saint albans where as the king and queen do mean to hawk
come nell thou wilt ride with us
yes my good lord i ll follow presently
exeunt gloucester and messenger follow i must i cannot go before while gloucester bears this base and humble mind
were i a man a duke and next of blood i would remove these tedious stumbling blocks and smooth my way upon their headless necks and being a woman i will not be slack to play my part in fortune s pageant
where are you there sir john
nay fear not man we are alone here s none but thee and i
but by the grace of god and hume s advice your grace s title shall be multiplied
hast thou as yet conferr d with margery jourdain the cunning witch of eie with roger bolingbroke the conjurer
and will they undertake to do me good
this they have promised to show your highness a spirit rais d from depth of underground that shall make answer to such questions as by your grace shall be propounded him duchess
it is enough i ll think upon the questions when from saint albans we do make return we ll see these things effected to the full
here hume take this reward make merry man with thy confederates in this weighty cause
hume must make merry with the duchess gold marry and shall
but how now sir john hume
seal up your lips and give no words but mum the business asketh silent secrecy
dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
yet have i gold flies from another coast i dare not say from the rich cardinal and from the great and new made duke of suffolk yet i do find it so for to be plain they knowing dame eleanor s aspiring humour have hired me to undermine the duchess and buzz these conjurations in her brain
they say a crafty knave does need no broker yet am i suffolk and the cardinal s broker
hume if you take not heed you shall go near to call them both a pair of crafty knaves
well so its stands and thus i fear at last hume s knavery will be the duchess wreck and her attainture will be humphrey s fall sort how it will i shall have gold for all
the palace enter three or four petitioners peter the armourer s man being one first petitioner
my masters let s stand close my lord protector will come this way by and by and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill
marry the lord protect him for he s a good man jesu bless him
enter suffolk and queen first petitioner
here a comes methinks and the queen with him
i ll be the first sure
come back fool this is the duke of suffolk and not my lord protector
i pray my lord pardon me i took ye for my lord protector
are your supplications to his lordship
mine is an t please your grace against john goodman my lord cardinal s man for keeping my house and lands and wife and all from me
reads against the duke of suffolk for enclosing the commons of melford
alas sir i am but a poor petitioner of our whole township
presenting his petition against my master thomas horner for saying that the duke of york was rightful heir to the crown
did the duke of york say he was rightful heir to the crown
my master said that he was and that the king was an usurper
enter servant take this fellow in and send for his master with a pursuivant presently
we ll hear more of your matter before the king
and as for you that love to be protected under the wings of our protector s grace begin your suits anew and sue to him
tears the supplications away base cullions
my lord of suffolk say is this the guise is this the fashions in the court of england
is this the government of britain s isle and this the royalty of albion s king
what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucester s governance
am i a queen in title and in style and must be made a subject to a duke
i tell thee pole when in the city tours thou ran st a tilt in honour of my love and stol st away the ladies hearts of france i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness to number ave maries on his beads his champions are the prophets and apostles his weapons holy saws of sacred writ his study is his tilt yard and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints
i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope and carry him to rome and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness
as i was cause your highness came to england so will i in england work your grace s full content
beside the haughty protector have we beaufort the imperious churchman somerset buckingham and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king
and he of these that can do most of all cannot do more in england than the nevils salisbury and warwick are no simple peers
not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame the lord protector s wife
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies more like an empress than duke humphrey s wife
strangers in court do take her for the queen
she bears a duke s revenues on her back and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be aveng d on her
contemptuous base born callet as she is she vaunted mongst her minions t other day the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my father s lands till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
madam myself have lim d a bush for her and plac d a quire of such enticing birds that she will light to listen to the lays and never mount to trouble you again
and madam list to me for i am bold to counsel you in this although we fancy not the cardinal yet must we join with him and with the lords till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace
as for the duke of york this late complaint will make but little for his benefit
so one by one we ll weed them all at last and you yourself shall steer the happy helm
enter the king duke humphrey cardinal beaufort buckingham york somerset salisbury warwick and the duchess of gloucester king henry
for my part noble lords i care not which or somerset or york all s one to me
if york have ill demean d himself in france then let him be denay d the regentship
if somerset be unworthy of the place let york be regent i will yield to him
whether your grace be worthy yea or no dispute not that york is the worthier
ambitious warwick let thy betters speak
the cardinal s not my better in the field
all in this presence are thy betters warwick
warwick may live to be the best of all
and show some reason buckingham why somerset should be preferr d in this
because the king forsooth will have it so
madam the king is old enough himself to give his censure
these are no women s matters
if he be old enough what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence
madam i am protector of the realm and at his pleasure will resign my place
resign it then and leave thine insolence
since thou wert king as who is king but thou the commonwealth hath daily run to wrack the dauphin hath prevail d beyond the seas and all the peers and nobles of the realm have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
the commons hast thou rack d the clergy s bags are lank and lean with thy extortions
thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife s attire have cost a mass of public treasury
thy cruelty in execution upon offenders hath exceeded law and left thee to the mercy of the law
thy sale of offices and towns in france if they were known as the suspect is great would make thee quickly hop without thy head
the queen drops queen her fan give me my fan
she gives the duchess a box on the ear i cry your mercy madam was it you
yea i it was proud frenchwoman
could i come near your beauty with my nails i could set my ten commandments in your face
sweet aunt be quiet twas against her will
look to t in time she ll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby
though in this place most master wear no breeches she shall not strike dame eleanor unreveng d
lord cardinal i will follow eleanor and listen after humphrey how he proceeds
she s tickled now her fume needs no spurs she ll gallop far enough to her destruction
now lords my choler being overblown with walking once about the quadrangle i come to talk of commonwealth affairs
as for your spiteful false objections prove them and i lie open to the law but god in mercy so deal with my soul as i in duty love my king and country
but to the matter that we have in hand i say my sovereign york is meetest man to be your regent in the realm of france
before we make election give me leave to show some reason of no little force that york is most unmeet of any man
i ll tell thee suffolk why i am unmeet first for i cannot flatter thee in pride next if i be appointed for the place my lord of somerset will keep me here without discharge money or furniture till france be won into the dauphin s hands
last time i danc d attendance on his will till paris was besieg d famish d and lost
that can i witness and a fouler fact did never traitor in the land commit
image of pride why should i hold my peace
enter horner the armourer and his man peter guarded suffolk
because here is a man accus d of treason pray god the duke of york excuse himself
doth any one accuse york for a traitor
please it your majesty this is the man that doth accuse his master of high treason his words were these that richard duke of york was rightful heir unto the english crown and that your majesty was an usurper
say man were these thy words
an t shall please your majesty i never said nor thought any such matter
god is my witness i am falsely accus d by the villain
holding up his hands by these ten bones my lords he did speak them to me in the garret one night as we were scouring my lord of york s armour
base dunghill villain and mechanical i ll have thy head for this thy traitor s speech
i do beseech your royal majesty let him have all the rigour of the law
alas my lord hang me if ever i spake the words
my accuser is my prentice and when i did correct him for his fault the other day he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me
i have good witness of this therefore i beseech your majesty do not cast away an honest man for a villain s accusation
uncle what shall we say to this in law
this doom my lord if i may judge let somerset be regent o er the french because in york this breeds suspicion and let these have a day appointed them for single combat in convenient place for he hath witness of his servant s malice
this is the law and this duke humphrey s doom
i humbly thank your royal majesty
and i accept the combat willingly
alas my lord i cannot fight for god s sake pity my case
the spite of man prevaileth against me
o lord have mercy upon me i shall never be able to fight a blow
sirrah or you must fight or else be hang d

madam sit you and fear not whom we raise we will make fast within a hallow d verge
here they do the ceremonies belonging and make the circle bolingbroke or southwell reads conjuro te c it thunders and lightens terribly then the spirit riseth spirit
asmath by the eternal god whose name and power thou tremblest at answer that i shall ask for till thou speak thou shalt not pass from hence
ask what thou wilt that i had said and done
reads first of the king what shall of him become
the duke yet lives that henry shall depose but him outlive and die a violent death

scene i saint albans enter the king queen gloucester cardinal and suffolk with falconers halloing queen

to see how god in all his creatures works
yea man and birds are fain of climbing high
no marvel an it like your majesty my lord protector s hawks do tow r so well they know their master loves to be aloft and bears his thoughts above his falcon s pitch
my lord tis but a base ignoble mind that mounts no higher than a bird can soar
i thought as much he would be above the clouds

were it not good your grace could fly to heaven
thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart pernicious protector dangerous peer that smooth st it so with king and commonweal

no malice sir no more than well becomes so good a quarrel and so bad a peer

enter a townsman of saint albans crying a miracle

stand by my masters bring him near the king his highness pleasure is to talk with him
good fellow tell us here the circumstance that we for thee may glorify the lord
what hast thou been long blind and now restor d
born blind an t please your grace
his wife an t like your worship
hadst thou been his mother thou couldst have better told
at berwick in the north an t like your grace
poor soul god s goodness hath been great to thee
let never day nor night unhallowed pass but still remember what the lord hath done
tell me good fellow cam st thou here by chance or of devotion to this holy shrine
god knows of pure devotion being call d a hundred times and oft ner in my sleep by good saint alban who said simpcox come come offer at my shrine and i will help thee
most true forsooth and many time and oft myself have heard a voice to call him so
a fall off of a tree
how long hast thou been blind
what and wouldst climb a tree
but that in all my life when i was a youth
too true and bought his climbing very dear
mass thou lov dst plums well that wouldst venture so
alas good master my wife desir d some damsons and made me climb with danger of my life
but yet it shall not serve let me see thine eyes wink now now open them in my opinion yet thou seest not well
yes master clear as day i thank god and saint alban
what colour is this cloak of
what colour is my gown of
black forsooth coal black as jet
why then thou know st what colour jet is of
and yet i think jet did he never see
but cloaks and gowns before this day a many
never before this day in all his life
tell me sirrah what s my name
saunder simpcox an if it please you master
then saunder sit there the lying st knave in christendom
if thou hadst been born blind thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear
sight may distinguish of colours but suddenly to nominate them all it is impossible
my lords saint alban here hath done a miracle and would ye not think his cunning to be great that could restore this cripple to his legs again
my masters of saint albans have you not beadles in your town and things call d whips
yes my lord if it please your grace
sirrah go fetch the beadle hither straight
now fetch me a stool hither by and by
a stool brought now sirrah if you mean to save yourself from whipping leap me over this stool and run away
alas master i am not able to stand alone

enter a beadle with whips gloucester
well sir we must have you find your legs
sirrah beadle whip him till he leap over that same stool
come on sirrah off with your doublet quickly
alas master what shall i do
i am not able to stand
after the beadle hath hit him once he leaps over the stool and runs away and they follow and cry a miracle
o god seest thou this and bearest so long
it made me laugh to see the villain run
follow the knave and take this drab away
alas sir we did it for pure need
let them be whipp d through every market town till they come to berwick from whence they came
exeunt mayor beadle wife c cardinal
duke humphrey has done a miracle to day
true made the lame to leap and fly away
but you have done more miracles than i you made in a day my lord whole towns to fly
what tidings with our cousin buckingham
such as my heart doth tremble to unfold a sort of naughty persons lewdly bent under the countenance and confederacy of lady eleanor the protector s wife the ringleader and head of all this rout have practis d dangerously against your state dealing with witches and with conjurers whom we have apprehended in the fact raising up wicked spirits from under ground demanding of king henry s life and death and other of your highness privy council as more at large your grace shall understand
and so my lord protector by this means your lady is forthcoming yet at london
this news i think hath turn d your weapon s edge tis like my lord you will not keep your hour
ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
sorrow and grief have vanquish d all my powers and vanquish d as i am i yield to the or to the meanest groom
o god what mischiefs work the wicked ones heaping confusion on their own heads thereby
gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest and look thyself be faultless thou wert best
madam for myself to heaven i do appeal how i have lov d my king and commonweal and for my wife i know not how it stands
sorry i am to hear what i have heard
noble she is but if she have forgot honour and virtue and convers d with such as like to pitch defile nobility i banish her my bed and company and give her as a prey to law and shame that hath dishonoured gloucester s honest name
well for this night we will repose us here
to morrow toward london back again to look into this business thoroughly and call these foul offenders to their answers and poise the cause in justice equal scales whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails
the duke of york s garden enter york salisbury and warwick york
now my good lords of salisbury and warwick our simple supper ended give me leave in this close walk to satisfy myself in craving your opinion of my tide which is infallible to england s crown
my lord i long to hear it at full
sweet york begin and if thy claim be good the nevils are thy subjects to command
then thus edward the third my lords had seven sons the first edward the black prince prince of wales the second william of hatfield and the third lionel duke of clarence next to whom was john of gaunt the duke of lancaster the fifth was edmund langley duke of york the sixth was thomas of woodstock duke of gloucester william of windsor was the seventh and last
edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard his only son who after edward the third s death reign d as king till henry bolingbroke duke of lancaster the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt crown d by the name of henry the fourth seiz d on the realm depos d the rightful king sent his poor queen to france from whence she came
and him to pomfret where as all you know harmless richard was murdered traitorously
father the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown
which now they hold by force and not by right for richard the first son s heir being dead the issue of the next son should have reign d
but william of hatfield died without an heir
the third son duke of clarence from whose line i claim the crown had issue philippe a daughter who married edmund mortimer earl of march edmund had issue roger earl of march roger had issue edmund anne and eleanor
this edmund in the reign of bolingbroke as i have read laid claim unto the crown and but for owen glendower had been king who kept him in captivity till he died
his eldest sister anne my mother being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge who was to edmund langley edward the third s fifth son son
by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march who was the son of edmund mortimer who married philippe sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger i am king
what plain proceedings is more plain than this
henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt the fourth son york claims it from the third
till lionel s issue fails his should not reign
it fails not yet but flourishes in thee and in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
then father salisbury kneel we together and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honour of his birthright to the crown
long live our sovereign richard england s king
but i am not your king till i be crown d and that my sword be stain d with heart blood of the house of lancaster and that s not suddenly to be perform d but with advice and silent secrecy
do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolk s insolence at beaufort s pride at somerset s ambition at buckingham and all the crew of them till they have snar d the shepherd of the flock that virtuous prince the good duke humphrey tis that they seek and they in seeking that shall find their deaths if york can prophesy
my lord break we off we know your mind at full
my heart assures me that the earl of warwick shall one day make the duke of york a king
and nevil this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king
a hall of justice sound trumpets
enter the king and state the queen gloucester york suffolk and salisbury with guard to banish the duchess
enter guarded the duchess of gloucester margery jourdain hume southwell and bolingbroke king henry

i beseech your majesty give me leave to go sorrow would solace and mine age would ease
stay humphrey duke of gloucester ere thou go give up thy staff henry will to himself protector be and god shall be my hope my stay my guide and lantern to my feet
and go in peace humphrey no less belov d than when thou wert protector to thy king
i see no reason why a king of years should be to be protected like a child
god and king henry govern england s realm
give up your staff sir and the king his realm
here noble henry is my staff
as willingly do i the same resign as ere thy father henry made it mine and even as willingly at thy feet i leave it as others would ambitiously receive it
farewell good king when i am dead and gone may honourable peace attend thy throne
why now is henry king and margaret queen and humphrey duke of gloucester scarce himself that bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once his lady banish d and a limb lopp d off
this staff of honour raught there let it stand where it best fits to be in henry s hand
thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays thus eleanor s pride dies in her youngest days
please it your majesty this is the day appointed for the combat and ready are the appellant and defendant the armourer and his man to enter the lists so please your highness to behold the fight
ay good my lord for purposely therefore left i the court to see this quarrel tried
a god s name see the lists and all things fit here let them end it and god defend the right
i never saw a fellow worse bested or more afraid to fight than is the appellant the servant of his armourer my lords
enter at one door horner the armourer and his neighbours drinking to him so much that he is drunk and he enters with a drum before him and his staff with a sand bag fastened to it and at the other door peter his man with a drum and sandbag and prentices drinking to him first neighbour
here neighbour horner i drink to you in a cup of sack and fear not neighbour you shall do well enough
and here neighbour here s a cup of charneco
and here s a pot of good double beer neighbour drink and fear not your man
let it come i faith and i ll pledge you all and a fig for peter

o lord bless me i pray god

come leave your drinking and fall to blows
then see thou thump thy master well
masters i am come hither as it were upon my man s instigation to prove him a knave and myself an honest man and touching the duke of york i will take my death i never meant him any ill nor the king nor the queen and therefore peter have at thee with a down right blow
dispatch this knave s tongue begins to double
sound trumpets alarum to the combatants
they fight and peter strikes him down horner
fellow thank god and the good wine in thy master s way
o god have i overcome mine enemies in this presence
o peter thou hast prevail d in right
go take hence that traitor from our sight for by his death we do perceive his guilt and god in justice hath reveal d to us the truth and innocence of this poor fellow which he had thought to have murder d wrongfully
come fellow follow us for thy reward
a street enter duke humphrey and his men in mourning cloaks gloucester
thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud and after summer evermore succeeds barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
ten is the hour that was appointed me to watch the coming of my punish d duchess
uneath may she endure the flinty streets to tread them with her tender feeling feet
sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook the abject people gazing on thy face with envious looks laughing at thy shame that erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
i think she comes and i ll prepare my tear stain d eyes to see her miseries
enter the duchess of gloucester in a white sheet and a taper burning in her hand with sir john stanley the sheriff and officers serving man
so please your grace we ll take her from the sheriff
no stir not for your lives let her pass by
come you my lord to see my open shame
see how the giddy multitude do point and nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee ah gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks and in thy closet pent up rue my shame and ban thine enemies both mine and thine
be patient gentle nell forget this grief
ah gloucester teach me to forget myself
for whilst i think i am thy married wife and thou a prince protector of this land methinks i should not thus be led along mail d up in shame with papers on my back and follow d with a rabble that rejoice to see my tears and hear my deep fet groans
the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet and when i start the envious people laugh and bid me be advised how i tread
ah humphrey can i bear this shameful yoke
trowest thou that e er i ll look upon the world or count them happy that enjoy the sun
no dark shall be my light and night my day to think upon my pomp shall be my hell
sometimes i ll say i am duke humphrey s wife and he a prince and ruler of the land yet so he rul d and such a prince he was as he stood by whilst i his forlorn duchess was made a wonder and a pointing stock to every idle rascal follower
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame nor stir at nothing till the axe of death hang over thee as sure it shortly will
for suffolk he that can do all in all with her that hateth thee and hates us all and york and impious beaufort that false priest have all lim d bushes to betray thy wings and fly thou how thou canst they ll tangle thee
but fear not thou until thy foot be snar d nor never seek prevention of thy foes
i must offend before i be attainted and had i twenty times so many foes and each of them had twenty times their power all these could not procure me any scathe so long as i am loyal true and crimeless
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
why yet thy scandal were not wip d away but i in danger for the breach of law
thy greatest help is quiet gentle nell
i pray thee sort thy heart to patience these few days wonder will be quickly worn
i summon your grace to his majesty s parliament holden at bury the first of this next month
and my consent ne er ask d herein before
exit herald my nell i take my leave and master sheriff let not her penance exceed the king s commission
an t please your grace here my commission stays and sir john stanley is appointed now to take her with him to the isle of man
must you sir john protect my lady here
so am i given in charge may t please your grace
entreat her not the worse in that i pray you use her well the world may laugh again and i may live to do you kindness if you do it her
what gone my lord and bid me not farewell
witness my tears i cannot stay to speak
my joy is death death at whose name i oft have been afeard because i wish d this world s eternity
stanley i prithee go and take me hence i care not whither for i beg no favour only convey me where thou art commanded
why madam that is to the isle of man there to be us d according to your state
that s bad enough for i am but reproach and shall i then be us d reproachfully
like to a duchess and duke humphrey s lady according to that state you shall be us d
sheriff farewell and better than i fare although thou hast been conduct of my shame
it is my office and madam pardon me
ay ay farewell thy office is discharg d
madam your penance done throw off this sheet and go we to attire you for our journey
my shame will not be shifted with my sheet
no it will hang upon my richest robes and show itself attire me how i can
go lead the way i long to see my prison
the abbey at bury st edmunds sound a sennet
enter the king the queen cardinal suffolk york buckingham salisbury and warwick to the parliament king henry
i muse my lord of gloucester is not come
tis not his wont to be the hindmost man whate er occasion keeps him from us now
can you not see or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alter d countenance
with what a majesty he bears himself how insolent of late he is become how proud how peremptory and unlike himself
we know the time since he was mild and affable and if we did but glance a far off look immediately he was upon his knee that all the court admir d him for submission
but meet him now and be it in the morn when every one will give the time of day he knits his brow and shows an angry eye and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee disdaining duty that to us belongs
small curs are not regarded when they grin but great men tremble when the lion roars and humphrey is no little man in england
first note that he is near you in descent and should you fall he is the next will mount me seemeth then it is no policy respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness council
by flattery hath he won the commons hearts and when he please to make commotion tis to be fear d they all will follow him
now tis the spring and weeds are shallow rooted suffer them now and they ll o ergrow the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry
the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke
if it be fond can it a woman s fear which fear if better reasons can supplant i will subscribe and say i wrong d the duke
my lord of suffolk buckingham and york reprove my allegation if you can or else conclude my words effectual
well hath your highness seen into this duke and had i first been put to speak my mind i think i should have told your grace s tale
the duchess by his subornation upon my life began her devilish practices or if he were not privy to those faults yet by reputing of his high descent as next the king he was successive heir and such high vaunts of his nobility did instigate the bedlam brainsick duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereign s fall
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep and in his simple show he harbours treason
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
no no my sovereign gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
did he not contrary to form of law devise strange deaths for small offences done
and did he not in his protectorship levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers pay in france and never sent it
by means whereof the towns each day revolted
tut these are petty faults to faults unknown which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey
my lords at once the care you have of us to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot is worthy praise but shall i speak my conscience
our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall
ah what s more dangerous than this fond affiance
his feathers are but borrow d for he s disposed as the hateful raven
his skin is surely lent him for he s inclin d as is the ravenous wolf
who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
take heed my lord the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
all health unto my gracious sovereign
that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you all is lost
cold news lord somerset but god s will be done
aside cold news for me for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away but i will remedy this gear ere long or sell my title for a glorious grave
all happiness unto my lord the king
pardon my liege that i have stay d so long
nay gloucester know that thou art come too soon unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
i do arrest thee of high treason here
well suffolk thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted
the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign
tis thought my lord that you took bribes of france and being protector stay d the soldiers pay by means whereof his highness hath lost france
what are they that think it
i never robb d the soldiers of their pay nor ever had one penny bribe from france
so help me god as i have watch d the night ay night by night in studying good for england
that doit that e er i wrested from the king or any groat i hoarded to my use be brought against me at my trial day
no many a pound of mine own proper store because i would not tax the needy commons have i dispursed to the garrisons and never ask d for restitution
it serves you well my lord to say so much
i say no more than truth so help me god
in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of that england was defam d by tyranny
why tis well known that whiles i was protector pity was all the fault that was in me for i should melt at an offender s tears and lowly words were ransom for their fault
unless it were a bloody murderer or foul felonious thief that fleec d poor passengers i never gave them condign punishment
murder indeed that bloody sin i tortur d above the felon or what trespass else
my lord these faults are easy quickly answer d but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
i do arrest you in his highness name and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep until your further time of trial
my lord of gloucester tis my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspense
my conscience tells me you are innocent
ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
virtue is chok d with foul ambition and charity chas d hence by rancour s hand foul subornation is predominant and equity exil d your highness land
i know their complot is to have my life and if my death might make this island happy and prove the period of their tyranny i would expend it with all willingness
but mine is made the prologue to their play for thousands more that yet suspect no peril will not conclude their plotted tragedy
beaufort s red sparkling eyes blab his heart s malice and suffolk s cloudy brow his stormy hate sharp buckingham unburdens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart and dogged york that reaches at the moon whose overweening arm i have pluck d back by false accuse doth level at my life
and you my sovereign lady with the rest causeless have laid disgraces on my head and with your best endeavour have stirr d up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay all of you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life
i shall not want false witness to condemn me nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
the ancient proverb will be well effected a staff is quickly found to beat a dog
my liege his railing is intolerable
if those that care to keep your royal person from treason s secret knife and traitor s rage be thus upbraided chid and rated at and the offender granted scope of speech twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace
hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words though clerkly couch d as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to o erthrow his state
but i can give the loser leave to chide
far truer spoke than meant i lose indeed
beshrew the winners for they play d me false
and well such losers may have leave to speak
he ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
lord cardinal he is your prisoner
sirs take away the duke and guard him sure
ah thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
ah that my fear were false
for good king henry thy decay i fear
my lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best do or undo as if ourself were here
what will your highness leave the parliament
ay margaret my heart is drown d with grief whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes my body round engirt with misery for what s more miserable than discontent
ah uncle humphrey in thy face i see the map of honour truth and loyalty
and yet good humphrey is the hour to come that e er i prov d thee false or fear d thy faith
what louring star now envies thy estate that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life
his fortunes i will weep and twixt each groan say who s a traitor
free lords cold snow melts with the sun s hot beams henry my lord is cold in great affairs too full of foolish pity and gloucester s show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers or as the snake roll d in a flow ring bank with shining checker d slough doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent
believe me lords were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world to rid us from the fear we have of him
that he should die is worthy policy but yet we want a colour for his death
tis meet he be condemn d by course of law
but in my mind that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life the commons haply rise to save his life and yet we have but trivial argument more than mistrust that shows him worthy death
so that by this you would not have him die
ah york no man alive so fain as i
tis york that hath more reason for his death
but my lord cardinal and you my lord of suffolk say as you think and speak it from your souls were t not all one an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite as place duke humphrey for the king s protector
so the poor chicken should be sure of death
madam tis true and were t not madness then to make the fox surveyor of the fold
who being accus d a crafty murderer his guilt should be but idly posted over because his purpose is not executed
no let him die in that he is a fox by nature prov d an enemy to the flock before his chaps be stain d with crimson blood as humphrey prov d by reasons to my liege
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins by snares by subtlety sleeping or waking tis no matter how so he be dead for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit
thrice noble suffolk tis resolutely spoke
not resolute except so much were done for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue seeing the deed is meritorious and to preserve my sovereign from his foe say but the word and i will be his priest
but i would have him dead my lord of suffolk ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed and i ll provide his executioner i tender so the safety of my liege
here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
and now we three have spoke it it skills not greatly who impugns our doom
great lords from ireland am i come amain to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword
send succours lords and stop the rage betime before the wound do grow uncurable for being green there is great hope of help
a breach that craves a quick expedient stop
what counsel give you in this weighty cause
that somerset be sent as regent thither tis meet that lucky ruler be employ d witness the fortune he hath had in france
if york with all his far fet policy had been the regent there instead of me he never would have stay d in france so long
no not to lose it all as thou hast done
i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burden of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost
show me one scar character d on thy skin men s flesh preserv d so whole do seldom win
nay then this spark will prove a raging fire if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more good york sweet somerset be still
thy fortune york hadst thou been regent there might happily have prov d far worse than his
nay then a shame take all
and in the number thee that wishest shame
my lord of york try what your fortune is
th uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men collected choicely from each county some and try your hap against the irishmen
i will my lord so please his majesty
why our authority is his consent and what we do establish he confirms then noble york take thou this task in hand
i am content provide me soldiers lords whiles i take order for mine own affairs
a charge lord york that i will see perform d
but now return we to the false duke humphrey
no more of him for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more
and so break off the day is almost spent
lord suffolk you and i must talk of that event
my lord of suffolk within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers for there i ll ship them all for ireland
i ll see it truly done my lord of york
now york or never steel thy fearful thoughts and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hop st to be or what thou art resign to death it is not worth th enjoying
let pale fac d fear keep with the mean born man and find no harbour in a royal heart
faster than spring time show rs comes thought on thought and not a thought but thinks on dignity
my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
well nobles well tis politicly done to send me packing with an host of men
i fear me you but warm the starved snake who cherish d in your breasts will sting your hearts
twas men i lack d and you will give them me i take it kindly
yet be well assur d you put sharp weapons in a madman s hands
whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head like to the glorious sun s transparent beams do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw
and for a minister of my intent i have seduc d a headstrong kentishman john cade of ashford to make commotion as full well he can under the tide of john mortimer
in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns and fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts were almost like a sharp quill d porpentine and in the end being rescu d i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
full often like a shag hair d crafty kern hath he conversed with the enemy and undiscover d come to me again and given me notice of their villainies
this devil here shall be my substitute for that john mortimer which now is dead in face in gait in speech he doth resemble
by this i shall perceive the commons mind how they affect the house and claim of york
say he be taken rack d and tortured i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i mov d him to those arms
say that he thrive as tis great like he will why then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sow d for humphrey being dead as he shall be and henry put apart the next for me
a room of state enter two or three murderers running over the stage from the murder of duke humphrey first murderer
run to my lord of suffolk let him know we have dispatch d the duke as he commanded
o that it were to do
didst ever hear a man so penitent
now sirs have you dispatch d this thing
ay my good lord he s dead
go get you to my house i will reward you for this venturous deed
the king and all the peers are here at hand
have you laid fair the bed
is all things well according as i gave directions
enter the king the queen cardinal somerset with attendants king henry
go call our uncle to our presence straight say we intend to try his grace to day if he be guilty as tis published
i ll call him presently my noble lord
lords take your places and i pray you all proceed no straiter gainst our uncle gloucester than from true evidence of good esteem he be approv d in practice culpable
god forbid any malice should prevail that faultless may condemn a nobleman
pray god he may acquit him of suspicion
i thank thee meg these words content me much
dead in his bed my lord gloucester is dead
i did dream to night the duke was dumb and could not speak a word
rear up his body wring him by the nose
he doth revive again madam be patient
what doth my lord of suffolk comfort me
came he right now to sing a raven s note whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow rs and thinks he that the chirping of a wren by crying comfort from a hollow breast can chase away the first conceived sound
hide not thy poison with such sug red words lay not thy hands on me forbear i say their touch affrights me as a serpent s sting
thou baleful messenger out of my sight
upon thy eye balls murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty to fright the world
look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come basilisk and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight for in the shade of death i shall find joy in life but double death now gloucester s dead
why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus
although the duke was enemy to him yet he most christian like laments his death and for myself foe as he was to me might liquid tears or heart offending groans or blood consuming sighs recall his life i would be blind with weeping sick with groans look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs and all to have the noble duke alive
what know i how the world may deem of me
for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judg d i made the duke away so shall my name with slander s tongue be wounded and princes courts be fill d with my reproach
this get i by his death
to be a queen and crown d with infamy
ah woe is me for gloucester wretched man
be woe for me more wretched than he is
what dost thou turn away and hide thy face
i am no loathsome leper look on me
what art thou like the adder waxen deaf
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen
is all thy comfort shut in gloucester s tomb
why then dame margaret was ne er thy joy
erect his statue and worship it and make my image but an alehouse sign
was i for this nigh wreck d upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england s bank drove back again unto my native clime
what boded this but well forewarning wind did seem to say seek not a scorpion s nest nor set no footing on this unkind shore
what did i then but curs d the gentle gusts and he that loos d them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england s blessed shore or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
yet aeolus would not be a murderer but left that hateful office unto thee
the pretty vaulting sea refus d to drown me knowing that thou wouldst have me drown d on shore with tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cow r d in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides because thy flinty heart more hard than they might in thy palace perish margaret
as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs when from thy shore the tempest beat us back i stood upon the hatches in the storm and when the dusky sky began to rob my earnest gaping sight of thy land s view i took a costly jewel from my neck a heart it was bound in with diamonds and threw it towards thy land
the sea receiv d it and so i wish d thy body might my heart
and even with this i lost fair england s view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and call d them blind and dusky spectacles for losing ken of albion s wished coast
how often have i tempted suffolk s tongue the agent of thy foul inconstancy to sit and witch me as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father s acts commenc d in burning troy
am i not witch d like her
or thou not false like him
ay me i can no more
die margaret for henry weeps that thou dost live so long
enter warwick salisbury and many commons warwick
it is reported mighty sovereign that good duke humphrey traitorously is murd red by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort s means
the commons like an angry hive of bees that want their leader scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge
myself have calm d their spleenful mutiny until they hear the order of his death
that he is dead good warwick tis too true but how he died god knows not henry
enter his chamber view his breathless corpse and comment then upon his sudden death
that shall i do my liege
stay salisbury with the rude multitude till i return
exit exit salisbury with the commons king henry
o thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts my thoughts that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey s life
if my suspect be false forgive me god for judgment only doth belong to thee
fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk and with my fingers feel his hand un feeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies and to survey his dead and earthy image what were it but to make my sorrow greater
bed put forth with the body
come hither gracious sovereign view this body
that is to see how deep my grave is made for with his soul fled all my worldly solace for seeing him i see my life in death
as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father s wrathful curse i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this thrice famed duke
a dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
what instance gives lord warwick for his vow
see how the blood is settled in his face
oft have i seen a timely parted ghost of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless being all descended to the labouring heart who in the conflict that it holds with death attracts the same for aidance gainst the enemy which with the heart there cools and ne er returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again
but see his face is black and full of blood his eye balls further out than when he liv d staring full ghastly like a strangled man his hair uprear d his nostrils stretch d with struggling his hands abroad display d as one that grasp d and tugg d for life and was by strength subdu d
look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking his well proportion d beard made rough and rugged like to the summer s corn by tempest lodged
it cannot be but he was murd red here the least of all these signs were probable
why warwick who should do the duke to death
myself and beaufort had him in protection and we i hope sir are no murderers
but both of you were vow d duke humphrey s foes and you forsooth had the good duke to keep
tis like you would not feast him like a friend and tis well seen he found an enemy
then you belike suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey s timeless death
who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe but will suspect twas he that made the slaughter
who finds the partridge in the puttock s nest but may imagine how the bird was dead although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
even so suspicious is this tragedy
is beaufort term d a kite
i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men but here s a vengeful sword rusted with ease that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murder s crimson badge
say if thou dar st proud lord of warwickshire that i am faulty in duke humphrey s death
exeunt cardinal somerset and others warwick
what dares not warwick if false suffolk dare him
he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
madam be still with reverence may i say for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity
blunt witted lord ignoble in demeanour if ever lady wrong d her lord so much thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutor d churl and noble stock was graft with crab tree slip whose fruit thou art and never of the nevils noble race
but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames and that my sovereign s presence makes me mild i would false murd rous coward on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech and say it was thy mother that thou meant st that thou thyself was born in bastardy and after all this fearful homage done give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell pernicious blood sucker of sleeping men
thou shalt be waking while i shed thy blood if from this presence thou dar st go with me
away even now or i will drag thee hence
unworthy though thou art i ll cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey s ghost
exeunt suffolk and warwick king henry
what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
thrice is he arm d that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though lock d up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
re enter suffolk and warwick with their weapons drawn king
why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence
why what tumultuous clamour have we here
the trait rous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me mighty sovereign
to the commons within sirs stand apart the king shall know your mind
dread lord the commons send you word by me unless lord suffolk straight be done to death or banished fair england s territories they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous ling ring death
they say by him the good duke humphrey died they say in him they fear your highness death and mere instinct of love and loyalty free from a stubborn opposite intent as being thought to contradict your liking makes them thus forward in his banishment
they say in care of your most royal person that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death yet notwithstanding such a strait edict were there a serpent seen with forked tongue that slily glided towards your majesty it were but necessary you were wak d lest being suffer d in that harmful slumber the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
and therefore do they cry though you forbid that they will guard you whe er you will or no from such fell serpents as false suffolk is with whose envenomed and fatal sting your loving uncle twenty times his worth they say is shamefully bereft of life
within an answer from the king my lord of salisbury
tis like the commons rude unpolish d hinds could send such message to their sovereign but you my lord were glad to be employ d to show how quaint an orator you are
but all the honour salisbury hath won is that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king
within an answer from the king or we will all break in
go salisbury and tell them all from me i thank them for their tender loving care and had i not been cited so by them yet did i purpose as they do entreat for sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolk s means
and therefore by his majesty i swear whose far unworthy deputy i am he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer on the pain of death
o henry let me plead for gentle suffolk
ungentle queen to call him gentle suffolk
no more i say if thou dost plead for him thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
had i but said i would have kept my word but when i swear it is irrevocable
if after three days space thou here be st found on any ground that i am ruler of the world shall not be ransom for thy life
come warwick come good warwick go with me i have great matters to impart to thee
exeunt all but queen and suffolk queen
mischance and sorrow go along with you
heart s discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company
there s two of you the devil make a third and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
cease gentle queen these execrations and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave
fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
would curses kill as doth the mandrake s groan i would invent as bitter searching terms as curst as harsh and horrible to hear deliver d strongly through my fixed teeth with full as many signs of deadly hate as lean fac d envy in her loathsome cave
my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint mine hair be fix d an end as one distract ay every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burden d heart would break should i not curse them
gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
their chiefest prospect murd ring basilisks
their softest touch as smart as lizards stings
their music frightful as the serpent s hiss and boding screech owls make the consort full
all the foul terrors in dark seated hell queen
enough sweet suffolk thou torment st thyself and these dread curses like the sun gainst glass or like an overcharged gun recoil and turns the force of them upon thyself
you bade me ban and will you bid me leave
now by the ground that i am banish d from well could i curse away a winter s night though standing naked on a mountain top where biting cold would never let grass grow and think it but a minute spent in sport
o let me entreat thee cease
give me thy hand that i may dew it with my mournful tears nor let the rain of heaven wet this place to wash away my woeful monuments
o could this kiss be printed in thy hand that thou might st think upon these by the seal through whom a thousand sighs are breath d for thee
so get thee gone that i may know my grief tis but surmis d whiles thou art standing by as one that surfeits thinking on a want
i will repeal thee or be well assur d adventure to be banished myself and banished i am if but from thee
go speak not to me even now be gone
even thus two friends condemn d embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves loather a hundred times to part than die
yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
thus is poor suffolk ten times banished once by the king and three times thrice by thee tis not the land i care for wert thou thence a wilderness is populous enough so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art there is the world itself with every several pleasure in the world and where thou art not desolation
i can no more live thou to joy thy life myself no joy in nought but that thou liv st
to signify unto his majesty that cardinal beaufort is at point of death for suddenly a grievous sickness took him that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air blaspheming god and cursing men on earth
sometime he talks as if duke humphrey s ghost were by his side sometime he calls the king and whispers to his pillow as to him the secrets of his overcharged soul and i am sent to tell his majesty that even now he cries aloud for him
go tell this heavy message to the king
but wherefore grieve i at an hour s poor loss omitting suffolk s exile my soul s treasure
why only suffolk mourn i not for thee and with the southern clouds contend in tears theirs for the earth s increase mine for my sorrows
now get thee hence the king thou know st is coming if thou be found by me thou art but dead
if i depart from thee i cannot live and in thy sight to die what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
here could i breathe my soul into the air as mild and gentle as the cradle babe dying with mother s dug between its lips where from thy sight i should be raging mad and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul or i should breathe it so into thy body and then it liv d in sweet elysium
to die by thee were but to die in jest from thee to die were torture more than death
o let me stay befall what may befall
though parting be a fretful corrosive it is applied to a deathful wound
let me hear from thee for whereso er thou art in this world s globe i ll have an iris that shall find thee out
and take my heart with thee
a jewel lock d into the woefull st cask that ever did contain a thing of worth
even as a splitted bark so sunder we this way fall i to death
cardinal beaufort s bedchamber enter the king salisbury and warwick to the cardinal in bed king henry
if thou be st death i ll give thee england s treasure enough to purchase such another island so thou wilt let me live and feel no pain
ah what a sign it is of evil life where death s approach is seen so terrible
beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee
bring me unto my trial when you will
died he not in his bed
can i make men live whe er they will or no
then show me where he is i ll give a thousand pound to look upon him
he hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
comb down his hair look look
it stands upright like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul
give me some drink and bid the apothecary bring the strong poison that i bought of him
o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
o beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretch s soul and from his bosom purge this black despair
see how the pangs of death do make him grin salisbury
disturb him not let him pass peaceably
peace to his soul if god s good pleasure be
lord card nal if thou think st on heaven s bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
he dies and makes no sign o god forgive him
so bad a death argues a monstrous life
forbear to judge for we are sinners all
close up his eyes and draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation
enter a lieutenant a shipmaster and his mate and walter whitmore with sailors suffolk and other gentlemen as prisoners lieutenant
the gaudy blabbing and remorseful day is crept into the bosom of the sea and now loud howling wolves arouse the jades that drag the tragic melancholy night who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings clip dead men s graves and from their misty jaws breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize for whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs here shall they make their ransom on the sand or with their blood stain this discoloured shore
master this prisoner freely give i thee and thou that art his mate make boot of this the other walter whitmore is thy share
what is my ransom master let me know
a thousand crowns or else lay down your head
and so much shall you give or off goes yours
what think you much to pay two thousand crowns and bear the name and port of gentlemen
cut both the villains throats for die you shall the lives of those which we have lost in fight be counterpois d with such a petty sum
i ll give it sir and therefore spare my life
and so will i and write home for it straight
i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard to suffolk and therefore to revenge it shalt thou die and so should these if i might have my will
be not so rash take ransom let him live
look on my george i am a gentleman rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
and so am i my name is walter whitmore
thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
a cunning man did calculate my birth and told me that by water i should die yet let not this make thee be bloody minded thy name is gualtier being rightly sounded
gualtier or walter which it is i care not never yet did base dishonour blur our name but with our sword we wip d away the blot therefore when merchant like i sell revenge broke be my sword my arms torn and defac d and i proclaim d a coward through the world
stay whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince the duke of suffolk william de la pole
the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags
ay but these rags are no part of the duke jove sometime went disguis d and why not i
but jove was never slain as thou shalt be
obscure and lowly swain king henry s blood the honourable blood of lancaster must not be shed by such a jaded groom
hast thou not kiss d thy hand and held my stirrup bareheaded plodded by my foot cloth mule and thought thee happy when i shook my head
how often hast thou waited at my cup fed from my trencher kneel d down at the board when i have feasted with queen margaret
remember it and let it make thee crestfall n ay and allay thus thy abortive pride how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood and duly waited for my coming forth
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
speak captain shall i stab the forlorn swain
first let my words stab him as he hath me
base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
convey him hence and on our longboat s side strike off his head
thou dar st not for thy own
ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt troubles the silver spring where england drinks now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth for swallowing the treasure of the realm
thy lips that kiss d the queen shall sweep the ground and thou that smil dst at good duke humphrey s death against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain who in contempt shall hiss at thee again and wedded be thou to the hags of hell for daring to affy a mighty lord unto the daughter of a worthless king having neither subject wealth nor diadem
by devilish policy art thou grown great and like ambitious sylla overgorg d with gobbets of thy mother s bleeding heart
by thee anjou and maine were sold to france the false revolting normans thorough thee disdain to call us lord and picardy hath slain their governors surpris d our forts and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
the princely warwick and the nevils all whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain as hating thee are rising up in arms and now the house of york thrust from the crown by shameful murder of a guiltless king and lofty proud encroaching tyranny burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours advance our half fac d sun striving to shine under the which is writ invitis nubibus
the commons here in kent are up in arms and to conclude reproach and beggary is crept into the palace of our king and all by thee
o that i were a god to shoot forth thunder upon these paltry servile abject drudges
small things make base men proud this villain here being captain of a pinnace threatens more than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate
drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
it is impossible that i should die by such a lowly vassal as thyself
thy words move rage and not remorse in me
i go of message from the queen to france i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel
come suffolk i must waft thee to thy death
gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear
thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee
my gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
suffolk s imperial tongue is stem and rough us d to command untaught to plead for favour
far be it we should honour such as these with humble suit no rather let my head stoop to the block than these knees bow to any save to the god of heaven and to my king and sooner dance upon a bloody pole than stand uncover d to the vulgar groom
true nobility is exempt from fear more can i bear than you dare execute
hale him away and let him talk no more
come soldiers show what cruelty ye can that this my death may never be forgot great men oft die by vile bezonians a roman sworder and banditto slave murder d sweet tully brutus bastard hand stabb d julius caesar savage islanders pompey the great and suffolk dies by pirates
and as for these whose ransom we have set it is our pleasure one of them depart therefore come you with us and let him go
exeunt all but the first gentleman re enter whitmore with suffolk s body whitmore
there let his head and lifeless body lie until the queen his mistress bury it
his body will i bear unto the king
if he revenge it not yet will his friends so will the queen that living held him dear
exit with the body scene ii
blackheath enter george bevis and john holland george
come and get thee a sword though made of a lath they have been up these two days
they have the more need to sleep now then
i tell thee jack cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap upon it
so he had need for tis threadbare
well i say it was never merry world in england since gentlemen came up
virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen

the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from the tower to defend the city from the rebels
such aid as i can spare you shall command but i am troubled here with them myself the rebels have assay d to win the tower

what canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of normandy unto mounsieur basimecu the dauphin of france
be it known unto thee by these presence even the presence of lord mortimer that i am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art
thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be us d and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou hast built a paper mill
it will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear
thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer
moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hang d them when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live
thou dost ride in a foot cloth dost thou not
marry thou ought st not to let thy horse wear a cloak when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets
and work in their shirt too as myself for example that am a butcher
nothing but this tis bona terra mala gens
away with him away with him
hear me but speak and bear me where you will
kent in the commentaries caesar writ is term d the civil st place of all this isle
sweet is the country because full of riches the people liberal valiant active wealthy which makes me hope you are not void of pity
i sold not maine i lost not normandy yet to recover them would lose my life
justice with favour have i always done pray rs and tears have mov d me gifts could never
when have i aught exacted at your hands but to maintain the king the realm and you
large gifts have i bestow d on learned clerks because my book preferr d me to the king and seeing ignorance is the curse of god knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven unless you be possess d with devilish spirits you cannot but forbear to murder me
this tongue hath parley d unto foreign kings for your behoof
tut when struck st thou one blow in the field
oft have i struck those that i never saw and struck them dead
these cheeks are pale for watching for your good
give him a box o th ear and that will make em red again
long sitting to determine poor men s causes hath made me full of sickness and diseases
ye shall have a hempen caudle then and the help of hatchet
the palsy and not fear provokes me
nay he nods at us as who should say i ll be even with you i ll see if his head will stand steadier on a pole or no
take him away and behead him
tell me wherein have i offended most
have i affected wealth or honour
are my chests fill d up with extorted gold
is my apparel sumptuous to behold
whom have i injur d that ye seek my death
these hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding this breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts
aside i feel remorse in myself with his words but i ll bridle it
he shall die an it be but for pleading so well for his life away with him
he has a familiar under his tongue he speaks not o god s name
go take him away i say and strike off his head presently and then break into his son in law s house sir james cromer and strike off his head and bring them both upon two poles hither
if when you make your pray rs god should be so obdurate as yourselves how would it fare with your departed souls
and therefore yet relent and save my life
away with him and do as i command ye
exeunt some with lord say the proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute there shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it
men shall hold of me in capite and we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell
my lord when shall we go to cheapside and take up commodities upon our bills
re enter one with the heads cade
let them kiss one another for they lov d well when they were alive
now part them again lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in france
soldiers defer the spoil of the city until night for with these borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the streets and at every corner have them kiss
enter again cade and all his rabblement cade
sound a parley what noise is this i hear
dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley when i command them kill
enter buckingham and old clifford attended buckingham
ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee
and therefore yet relent and save my life
know cade we come ambassadors from the king unto the commons whom thou hast misled and here pronounce free pardon to them all that will forsake thee and go home in peace
will ye relent and yield to mercy whilst tis offer d you or let a rebel lead you to your deaths
who loves the king and will embrace his pardon fling up his cap and say god save his majesty
who hateth him and honours not his father henry the fifth that made all france to quake shake he his weapon at us and pass by
what buckingham and clifford are ye so brave
and you base peasants do ye believe him
will you needs be hang d with your about your necks
hath my sword therefore broke through london gates that you should leave me at the white hart in southwark
i thought ye would never have given out these arms till you had recovered your ancient freedom
but you are all recreants and dastards and delight to live in slavery to the nobility
let them break your backs with burdens take your houses over your heads ravish your wives and daughters before your faces
for me i will make shift for one and so god s curse light upon you all
we ll follow cade we ll follow cade
is cade the son of henry the fifth that thus you do exclaim you ll go with him
will he conduct you through the heart of france and make the meanest of you earls and dukes
alas he hath no home no place to fly to nor knows he how to live but by the spoil unless by robbing of your friends and us
were t not a shame that whilst you live at jar the fearful french whom you late vanquished should make a start o er seas and vanquish you
methinks already in this civil broil i see them lording it in london streets crying villiago
better ten thousand base born cades miscarry than you should stoop unto a frenchman s mercy
to france to france and get what you have lost spare england for it is your native coast
henry hath money you are strong and manly
god on our side doubt not of victory
we ll follow the king and clifford
was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude
the name of henry the fifth hales them to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me desolate
i see them lay their heads together to surprise me
my sword make way for me for here is no staying
in despite of the devils and hell have through the very middest of you
and heavens and honour be witness that no want of resolution in me but only my followers base and ignominious treasons makes me betake me to my heels
go some and follow him and he that brings his head unto the king shall have a thousand crowns for his reward
exeunt some of them follow me soldiers we ll devise a mean to reconcile you all unto the king
enter king queen and somerset on the terrace king henry
was ever king that joy d an earthly throne and could command no more content than i
no sooner was i crept out of my cradle but i was made a king at nine months old
was never subject long d to be a king as i do long and wish to be a subject
enter buckingham and old clifford buckingham
health and glad tidings to your majesty
why buckingham is the traitor cade surpris d
or is he but retir d to make him strong
enter below multitudes with halters about their necks clifford
he is fled my lord and all his powers do yield and humbly thus with halters on their necks expect your highness doom of life or death
then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates to entertain my vows of thanks and praise
soldiers this day have you redeem d your lives and show d how well you love your prince and country
continue still in this so good a mind and henry though he be infortunate assure yourselves will never be unkind
and so with thanks and pardon to you all i do dismiss you to your several countries
please it your grace to be advertised the duke of york is newly come from ireland and with a puissant and a mighty power of gallowglasses and stout kerns is marching hitherward in proud array and still proclaimeth as he comes along his arms are only to remove from thee the duke of somerset whom he terms a traitor
thus stands my state twixt cade and york distress d like to a ship that having scap d a tempest is straightway calm d and boarded with a pirate but now is cade driven back his men dispers d and now is york in arms to second him
i pray thee buckingham go and meet him and ask him what s the reason of these arms
tell him i ll send duke edmund to the tower and somerset we will commit thee thither until his army be dismiss d from him
my lord i ll yield myself to prison willingly or unto death to do my country good
in any case be not too rough in terms for he is fierce and cannot brook hard language
i will my lord and doubt not so to deal as all things shall redound unto your good
come wife let s in and learn to govern better for yet may england curse my wretched reign
iden s garden enter cade cade
fie on myself that have a sword and yet am ready to famish
these five days have i hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now am i so hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a thousand years i could stay no longer
wherefore on a brick wall have i climb d into this garden to see if i can eat grass or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a man s stomach this hot weather
and i think this word sallet was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brain pain had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when i have been dry and bravely marching it hath serv d me instead of a quart pot to drink in and now the word sallet must serve me to feed on
lord who would live turmoiled in the court and may enjoy such quiet walks as these
this small inheritance my father left me contenteth me and worth a monarchy
i seek not to wax great by others waning or gather wealth i care not with what envy sufficeth that i have maintains my state and sends the poor well pleased from my gate
here s the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for entering his fee simple without leave
ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him but i ll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and i part
why rude companion whatsoe er thou be i know thee not why then should i betray thee
is t not enough to break into my garden and like a thief to come to rob my grounds climbing my walls in spite of me the owner but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
ay by the best blood that ever was broach d and beard thee too
look on me well i have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and thy five men and if i do not leave you all as dead as a door nail i pray god i may never eat grass more
nay it shall ne er be said while england stands that alexander iden an esquire of kent took odds to combat a poor famish d man
oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine see if thou canst outface me with thy looks set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser thy hand is but a finger to my fist thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast and if mine arm be heaved in the air thy grave is digg d already in the earth
as for words whose greatness answers words let this my sword report what speech forbears
by my valour the most complete champion that ever i heard
steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly bon d clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath i beseech god on my knees thou mayst be turn d to hobnails
here they fight cade falls o i am slain
famine and no other hath slain me
let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the ten meals i have lost and i d defy them all
wither garden and be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house because the unconquered soul of cade is fled
is t cade that i have slain that monstrous traitor
sword i will hallow thee for this thy deed and hang thee o er my tomb when i am dead
ne er shall this blood be wiped from thy point but thou shalt wear it as a herald s coat to emblaze the honour that thy master got
iden farewell and be proud of thy victory
tell kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for i that never feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour
how much thou wrong st me heaven be my judge
die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
and as i thrust thy body in with my sword so wish i i might thrust thy soul to hell
hence will i drag thee headlong by the heels unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave and there cut off thy most ungracious head which i will bear in triumph to the king leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon
fields between dartford and blackheath enter york and his army of irish with drum and colours york
from ireland thus comes york to claim his right and pluck the crown from feeble henry s head ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright to entertain great england s lawful king
who would not buy thee dear
let them obey that knows not how to rule this hand was made to handle nought but gold
i cannot give due action to my words except a sword or sceptre balance it
a sceptre shall it have have i a soul on which i ll toss the flower de luce of france
enter buckingham aside whom have we here
the king hath sent him sure i must dissemble
york if thou meanest well i greet thee well
humphrey of buckingham i accept thy greeting
art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
a messenger from henry our dread liege to know the reason of these arms in peace or why thou being a subject as i am against thy oath and true allegiance sworn should raise so great a power without his leave or dare to bring thy force so near the court
aside scarce can i speak my choler is so great
o i could hew up rocks and fight with flint i am so angry at these abject terms and now like ajax telamonius on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury
i am far better born than is the king more like a king more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet awhile till henry be more weak and i more strong buckingham i prithee pardon me that i have given no answer all this while my mind was troubled with deep melancholy
the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king seditious to his grace and to the state
that is too much presumption on thy part but if thy arms be to no other end the king hath yielded unto thy demand the duke of somerset is in the tower
upon thine honour is he prisoner
upon mine honour he is prisoner
then buckingham i do dismiss my pow rs
soldiers i thank you all disperse yourselves meet me to morrow in saint george s field you shall have pay and everything you wish
and let my sovereign virtuous henry command my eldest son nay all my sons as pledges of my fealty and love
i ll send them all as willing as i live lands goods horse armour anything i have is his to use so somerset may die
york i commend this kind submission
we twain will go into his highness tent
enter the king and attendants king henry
buckingham doth york intend no harm to us that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm
in all submission and humility york doth present himself unto your highness
then what intends these forces thou dost bring

enter iden with cade s head iden
if one so rude and of so mean condition may pass into the presence of a king lo i present your grace a traitor s head the head of cade whom i in combat slew
great god how just art thou
o let me view his visage being dead that living wrought me such exceeding trouble
tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him
i was an t like your majesty
alexander iden that s my name a poor esquire of kent that loves his king
so please it you my lord twere not amiss he were created knight for his good service
he kneels rise up a knight
we give thee for reward a thousand marks and will that thou thenceforth attend on us
may iden live to merit such a bounty and never live but true unto his liege
enter the queen and somerset king henry
somerset comes with th queen go bid her hide him quickly from the duke
for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head but boldly stand and front him to his face
then york unloose thy long imprisoned thoughts and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
shall i endure the sight of somerset
false king why hast thou broken faith with me knowing how hardly i can brook abuse
no thou art not king not fit to govern and rule multitudes which dar st not no nor canst not rule a traitor
that head of thine doth not become a crown thy hand is made to grasp a palmer s staff and not to grace an awful princely sceptre
that gold must round engirt these brows of mine whose smile and frown like to achilles spear is able with the change to kill and cure
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up and with the same to act controlling laws
by heaven thou shalt rule no more o er him whom heaven created for thy ruler
i arrest thee york of capital treason gainst the king and crown
obey audacious traitor kneel for grace
first let me ask of these if they can brook i bow a knee to man
sirrah call in my sons to be my bail exit attendant i know ere thy will have me go to ward they ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement
call hither clifford bid him come amain to say if that the bastard boys of york shall be the surety for their traitor father
o blood bespotted neapolitan outcast of naples england s bloody scourge
the sons of york thy betters in their birth shall be their father s bail and bane to those that for my surety will refuse the boys
enter edward and richard plantagenet see where they come i ll warrant they ll make it good
enter clifford and his son queen
and here comes clifford to deny their bail
health and all happiness to my lord the king
nay do not fright us with an angry look
we are thy sovereign clifford kneel again for thy mistaking so we pardon thee
this is my king york i do not mistake but thou mistakes me much to think i do
ay clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour makes him oppose himself against his king
he is a traitor let him to the tower and chop away that factious pate of his
he is arrested but will not obey his sons he says shall give their words for him
ay noble father if our words will serve
and if words will not then our weapons shall
why what a brood of traitors have we here
look in a glass and call thy image so i am thy king and thou a false heart traitor
call hither to the stake my two brave bears that with the very shaking of their chains they may astonish these fell lurking curs
bid salisbury and warwick come to me
enter the earls of warwick and salisbury clifford
we ll bait thy bears to death and manacle the berard in their chains if thou dar st bring them to the baiting place
oft have i seen a hot o er weening cur run back and bite because he was withheld who being suffer d with the bear s fell paw hath clapp d his tail between his legs and cried and such a piece of service will you do if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick
hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump as crooked in thy manners as thy shape
nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
why warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
old salisbury shame to thy silver hair thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
what wilt thou on thy death bed play the ruffian and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
if it be banish d from the frosty head where shall it find a harbour in the earth
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war and shame thine honourable age with blood
why art thou old and want st experience
or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
in duty bend thy knee to me that bows unto the grave with mickle age
my lord i have considered with myself the tide of this most renowned duke and in my conscience do repute his grace the rightful heir to england s royal seat
hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
it is great sin to swear unto a sin but greater sin to keep a sinful oath
who can be bound by any solemn vow to do a murd rous deed to rob a man to force a spotless virgin s chastity to reave the orphan of his patrimony to wring the widow from her custom d right and have no other reason for this wrong but that he was bound by a solemn oath
a subtle traitor needs no sophister
call buckingham and bid him arm himself
call buckingham and all the friends thou hast i am resolv d for death or dignity
the first i warrant thee if dreams prove true
you were best to go to bed and dream again to keep thee from the tempest of the field
i am resolv d to bear a greater storm than any thou canst conjure up to day and that i ll write upon thy burgonet might i but know thee by thy household badge
now by my father s badge old nevil s crest the rampant bear chain d to the ragged staff this day i ll wear aloft my burgonet as on a mountain top the cedar shows that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm even to affright thee with the view thereof
and from thy burgonet i ll rend thy bear and tread it under foot with all contempt despite the berard that protects the bear
and so to arms victorious father to quell the rebels and their complices
speak not in spite for you shall sup with jesu christ to night
foul stigmatic that s more than thou canst tell
if not in heaven you ll surely sup in hell
saint albans alarums to the battle
clifford of cumberland tis warwick calls and if thou dost not hide thee from the bear now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum and dead men s cries do fill the empty air clifford i say come forth and fight with me
proud northern lord clifford of cumberland warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms
enter york how now my noble lord
the deadly handed clifford slew my steed but match to match i have encount red him and made a prey for carrion kites and crows even of the bonny beast he lov d so well
of one or both of us the time is come

then nobly york tis for a crown thou fight st
as i intend clifford to thrive to day it grieves my soul to leave thee unassail d
what seest thou in me york
with thy brave bearing should i be in love but that thou art so fast mine enemy
nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem but that tis shown ignobly and in treason
so let it help me now against thy sword as i in justice and true right express it
my soul and body on the action both

thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still
peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will
exit enter young clifford young clifford
all is on the rout fear frames disorder and disorder wounds where it should guard

sees his father s body o let the vile world end and the premised flames of the last day knit earth and heaven together
now let the general trumpet blow his blast particularities and petty sounds to cease
wast thou ordain d dear father to lose thy youth in peace and to achieve the silver livery of advised age and in thy reverence and thy chair days thus to die in ruffian battle
even at this sight my heart is turn d to stone and while tis mine it shall be stony
york not our old men spares no more will i their babes
tears virginal shall be to me even as the dew to fire and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
henceforth i will not have to do with pity meet i an infant of the house of york into as many gobbets will i cut it as wild medea young absyrtus did in cruelty will i seek out my fame
come thou new ruin of old clifford s house as did aeneas old anchises bear so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders but then aeneas bare a living load nothing so heavy as these woes of mine

lord stafford s father duke of buckingham is either slain or wounded dangerous i cleft his beaver with a downright blow
that this is true father behold his blood
and brother here s the earl of wiltshire s blood whom i encount red as the battles join d
speak thou for me and tell them what i did
throwing down somerset s head york
richard hath best deserv d of all my sons
but is your grace dead my lord of somerset
such hope have all the line of john of gaunt
thus do i hope to shake king henry s head
and so do i victorious prince of york before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
this is the palace of the fearful king and this the regal seat
possess it york for this is thine and not king henry s heirs
assist me then sweet warwick and i will for hither we have broken in by force
we ll all assist you he that flies shall die
stay by me my lords and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
and when the king comes offer him no violence
unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
the queen this day here holds her parliament but little thinks we shall be of her council
by words or blows here let us win our right
arm d as we are let s stay within this house
the bloody parliament shall this be call d unless plantagenet duke of york be king and bashful henry depos d whose cowardice hath made us by words to our enemies
then leave me not my lords be resolute i mean to take possession of my right
neither the king nor he that loves him best the proudest he that holds up lancaster dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells
i ll plant plantagenet root him up who dares
resolve thee richard claim the english crown
enter king henry clifford northumberland westmoreland exeter and others with red roses in their hats king henry
my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits even in the chair of state
belike he means back d by the power of warwick that false peer to aspire unto the crown and reign as king
earl of northumberland he slew thy father and thine lord clifford and you both have vow d revenge on him his sons his favourites and his friends
if i be not heavens be reveng d on me
the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel
let s pluck him down my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it
be patient gentle earl of westmoreland
patience is for poltroons such as he he durst not sit there had your father liv d
my gracious lord here in the parliament let us assail the family of york
well hast thou spoken cousin be it so
ah know you not the city favours them and they have troops of soldiers at their beck
but when the duke is slain they ll quickly fly
far be the thought of this from henry s heart to make a shambles of the parliament house
cousin of exeter frowns words and threats shall be the war that henry means to use
thou factious duke of york descend my throne and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet i am thy sovereign
for shame come down he made thee duke of york
twas my inheritance as the earldom was
thy father was a traitor to the crown
exeter thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry
whom should he follow but his natural king
true clifford and that s richard duke of york
and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne
it must and shall be so content thyself
be duke of lancaster let him be king
he is both king and duke of lancaster and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain
you forget that we are those which chas d you from the field and slew your fathers and with colours spread march d through the city to the palace gates
yes warwick i remember it to my grief and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
plantagenet of thee and these thy sons thy kinsmen and thy friends i ll have more lives than drops of blood were in my father s veins
urge it no more lest that instead of words i send thee warwick such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir
poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats
will you we show our title to the crown
if not our swords shall plead it in the field
what title hast thou traitor to the crown
thy father was as thou art duke of york thy grandfather roger mortimer earl of march i am the son of henry the fifth who made the dauphin and the french to stoop and seiz d upon their towns and provinces
talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all
the lord protector lost it and not i when i was crown d i was but nine months old
you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
father tear the crown from the usurper s head
sweet father do so set it on your head
good brother as thou lov st and honourest arms let s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus
sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly
and give king henry leave to speak
hear him lords and be you silent and attentive too for he that interrupts him shall not live
think st thou that i will leave my kingly throne wherein my grandsire and my father sat
no first shall war unpeople this my realm ay and their colours often borne in france and now in england to our heart s great sorrow shall be my winding sheet
my title s good and better far than his
prove it henry and thou shalt be king
henry the fourth by conquest got the crown
twas by rebellion against his king
aside i know not what to say my title s weak tell me may not a king adopt an heir
an if he may then am i lawful king for richard in the view of many lords resign d the crown to henry the fourth whose heir my father was and i am his
he rose against him being his sovereign and made him to resign his crown perforce
suppose my lords he did it unconstrain d think you twere prejudicial to his crown
no for he could not so resign his crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign
art thou against us duke of exeter
his is the right and therefore pardon me
why whisper you my lords and answer not
my conscience tells me he is lawful king
aside all will revolt from me and turn to him
plantagenet for all the claim thou lay st think not that henry shall be so depos d
depos d he shall be in despite of all
tis not thy southern power of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud can set the duke up in despite of me
king henry be thy title right or wrong lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence
may that ground gape and swallow me alive where i shall kneel to him that slew my father
o clifford how thy words revive my heart
henry of lancaster resign thy crown
what mutter you or what conspire you lords
do right unto this princely duke of york or i will fill the house with armed men and over the chair of state where now he sits write up his title with usurping blood
he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves king henry
my lord of warwick hear but one word let me for this my life time reign as king
confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv st
richard plantagenet enjoy the kingdom after my decease
what wrong is this unto the prince your son
what good is this to england and himself
how hast thou injur d both thyself and or us
i cannot stay to hear these articles
come cousin let us tell the queen these news
farewell faint hearted and degenerate king in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides
be thou a prey unto the house of york and die in bands for this unmanly deed
in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome or live in peace abandon d and despis d
exeunt northumberland clifford and westmoreland warwick
turn this way henry and regard them not
they seek revenge and therefore will not yield
why should you sigh my lord
not for myself lord warwick but my son whom i unnaturally shall disinherit
but be it as it may
to york i here entail the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever conditionally that here thou take an oath to cease this civil war and whilst i live to honour me as thy king and sovereign and neither by treason nor hostility to seek to put me down and reign thyself
this oath i willingly take and will perform
and long live thou and these thy forward sons
now york and lancaster are reconcil d
accurs d be he that seeks to make them foes
farewell my gracious lord i ll to my castle

enter queen margaret and the prince of wales exeter
here comes the queen whose looks bewray her anger
nay go not from me i will follow thee
be patient gentle queen and i will stay
who can be patient in such extremes
would i had died a maid and never seen thee never borne thee son seeing thou hast prov d so unnatural a father
hath he deserv d to lose his birthright thus
hadst thou but lov d him half so well as i or felt that pain which i did for him once or nourish d him as i did with my blood thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart blood there rather than have made that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son
if you be king why should not i succeed
pardon me margaret pardon me sweet son
the earl of warwick and the duke enforc d me
art thou king and wilt be forc d
i shame to hear thee speak
thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and giv n unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas the duke is made protector of the realm and yet shalt thou be safe
such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves
had i been there which am a silly woman the soldiers should have toss d me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act
but thou prefer st thy life before thine honour and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself both from thy table henry and thy bed until that act of parliament be repeal d whereby my son is disinherited
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine if once they see them spread and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york
come son let s away our army is ready come we ll after them
stay gentle margaret and hear me speak
thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone
gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me
ay to be murder d by his enemies
when i return with victory from the field i ll see your grace till then i ll follow her
come son away we may not linger thus
exeunt queen margaret and the prince king henry
how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage
reveng d may she be on that hateful duke whose haughty spirit winged with desire will cost my crown and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son
the loss of those three lords torments my heart
i ll write unto them and entreat them fair come cousin you shall be the messenger
and i i hope shall reconcile them all

enter edward richard and montague richard
brother though i be youngest give me leave
no i can better play the orator
but i have reasons strong and forcible
enter the duke of york york
why how now sons and brother
no quarrel but a slight contention
about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours
not till king henry be dead
your right depends not on his life or death
now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end
i took an oath that he should quietly reign
but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
no god forbid your grace should be forsworn
i shall be if i claim by open war
i ll prove the contrary if you ll hear me speak
thou canst not son it is impossible
an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears
henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dy d even in the lukewarm blood of henry s heart
richard enough i will be king or die
brother thou shalt to london presently and whet on warwick to this enterprise
thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk and tell him privily of our intent
you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit
while you are thus employ d what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house of lancaster
why com st thou in such post
the queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle
she is hard by with twenty thousand men and therefore fortify your hold my lord
think st thou that we fear them
edward and richard you shall stay with me my brother montague shall post to london
let noble warwick cobham and the rest whom we have left protectors of the king with pow rful policy strengthen themselves and trust not simple henry nor his oaths
brother i go i ll win them fear it not
and thus most humbly i do take my leave
exit enter sir john and sir hugh mortimer york

you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us
she shall not need we ll meet her in the field

a woman s general what should we fear
let s set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight
though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory
many a battle have i won in france when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success

ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands

ah clifford murder not this innocent child lest thou be hated both of god and man
exit forced off by soldiers clifford
how now is he dead already
or is it fear that makes him close his eyes
so looks the pent up lion o er the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting o er his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threat ning look
sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou reveng d on men and let me live
in vain thou speak st poor boy my father s blood hath stopp d the passage where thy words should enter
then let my father s blood open it again he is a man and clifford cope with him
had i thy brethren here their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me no if i digg d up thy forefathers graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive i live in hell
o let me pray before i take my death
to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me
such pity as my rapier s point affords
i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
but twas ere i was born
thou hast one son for his sake pity me lest in revenge thereof sith god is just he be as miserably slain as i ah let me live in prison all my days and when i give occasion of offence then let me die for now thou hast no cause
thy father slew my father therefore die
di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae

enter the duke of york york
the army of the queen hath got the field
my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursu d by hunger starved wolves
my sons god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know they have demean d themselves like men born to renown by life or death
three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father
and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encount red him
and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground
and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb
a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre
with this we charg d again but out alas
we bodg d again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with over matching waves
a short alarum within ah hark
the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury
the sands are numb red that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end
enter queen margaret clifford northumberland the prince of wales and soldiers come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot
yield to our mercy proud plantagenet
ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment show d unto my father
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick
my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whate er you can afflict me with
so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcon s piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives gainst the officers
o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought o errun my former time and if thou canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckler with thee blows twice two for one
hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitor s life
wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland
do not honour him so much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart
what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away
it is war s prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour
they lay hands on york who struggles clifford
ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
so doth the cony struggle in the net
so triumph thieves upon their conquer d booty so true men yield with robbers so o er match d
what would your grace have done unto him now
brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand
what was it you that would be england s king
was t you that revell d in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent
where are your mess of sons to back you now
the wanton edward and the lusty george
and where s that valiant crook back prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
or with the rest where is your darling rutland
look york i stain d this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapier s point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state
i prithee grieve to make me merry york
what hath thy fiery heart so parch d thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland s death
thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
thou wouldst be fee d i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
a crown for york and lords bow low to him
hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
putting a paper crown on his head ay marry sir now looks he like a king
ay this is he that took king henry s chair and this is he was his adopted heir
but how is it that great plantagenet is crown d so soon and broke his solemn oath
as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death
and will you pale your head in henry s glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath
o tis a fault too too off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
that is my office for my father s sake
nay stay let s hear the orisons he makes
she wolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adder s tooth
how ill beseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates
but that thy face is visard like unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
to tell thee whence thou cam st of whom deriv d were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death
tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small
tis virtue that doth make them most admir d the contrary doth make thee wond red at
tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable
thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion
o tiger s heart wrapp d in a woman s hide
how couldst thou drain the life blood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a woman s face
women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep
why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins
these tears are my sweet rutland s obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman
beshrew me but his passions move me so that hardly can i check my eyes from tears
that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touch d would not have stain d with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
see ruthless queen a hapless father s tears
this cloth thou dipp dst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away
keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tell st the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed
there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
hard hearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
had he been slaughter man to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
what weeping ripe my lord northumberland
think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears
here s for my oath here s for my father s death
and here s to right our gentle hearted king
open thy gate of mercy gracious god
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
off with his head and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york

enter edward richard and their power edward
i wonder how our princely father scap d or whether he be scap d away or no from clifford s and northumberland s pursuit
had he been ta en we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scap d methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape
i cannot joy until i be resolv d where our right valiant father is become
i saw him in the battle range about and watch d him how he singled clifford forth
methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompass d round with dogs who having pinch d a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
so far d our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father
methinks tis prize enough to be his son
see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
how well resembles it the prime of youth trimm d like a younker prancing to his love
dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns
three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but sever d in a pale clear shining sky
they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vow d some league inviolable
now are they but one lamp one light one sun
in this the heaven figures some event
tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world
whate er it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fair shining suns
nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male
enter a messenger blowing but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
ah one that was a woeful looker on when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord
for i have heard too much
say how he died for i will hear it all
environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have ent red troy
but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hews down and fells the hardest timber d oak
sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
o clifford boist rous clifford thou hast slain the flow r of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquish d him for hand to hand he would have vanquish d thee
now my soul s palace is become a prison
ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest
for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy
i cannot weep for all my body s moisture scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart nor can my tongue unload my heart s great burden for self same wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
to weep is to make less the depth of grief
tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
richard i bear thy name i ll venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it
his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left
nay if thou be that princely eagle s bird show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his
enter warwick montague and their army warwick
great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each word s deliverance stab poinards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds
o valiant lord the duke of york is slain
that plantagenet which held thee dearly as his soul s redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death
ten days ago i drown d these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befall n
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breath d his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart
i then in london keeper of the king muster d my soldiers gathered flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought march d toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry s oath and your succession
i cheer d them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste post haste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again
where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
and when came george from burgundy to england
some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war
twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled
oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but ne er till now his scandal of retire
nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry s head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is fam d for mildness peace and prayer
i know it well lord warwick blame me not
tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
but in this troublous time what s to be done
shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our ave maries with our beads
or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms
if for the last say ay and to it lords
why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague
the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many moe proud birds have wrought the easy melting king like wax
he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster
their power i think is thirty thousand strong
now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via
to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes
but never once again turn back and fly
ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak
ne er may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire
lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou fail st as god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is england s royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaim d in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task
then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine
god and saint george for us
the duke of norfolk sends you word by me the queen is coming with a puissant host and craves your company for speedy counsel
why then it sorts brave warriors let s away
enter king henry queen margaret the prince of wales clifford northumberland with drum and trumpets queen margaret
welcome my lord to this brave town of york
yonder s the head of that arch enemy that sought to be encompass d with your crown
doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck to see this sight it irks my very soul
withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault nor wittingly have i infring d my vow
my gracious liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
not to the beast that would usurp their den
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
not his that spoils her young before her face
who scapes the lurking serpent s mortal sting
not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
ambitious york did level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king bless d with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father
unreasonable creatures feed their young and though man s face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have us d with fearful flight make war with him that climb d unto their nest offering their own lives in their young s defence for shame my liege make them your precedent
were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father s fault and long hereafter say unto his child what my great grandfather and grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away
ah what a shame were this
look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him
full well hath clifford play d the orator inferring arguments of mighty force
but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things ill got had ever bad success
and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell
i ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more
for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousand fold more care to keep than in possession any jot of pleasure
would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here
my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh and this soft courage makes your followers faint
you promis d knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
edward plantagenet arise a knight and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
my gracious father by your kingly leave i ll draw it as apparent to the crown and in that quarrel use it to the death
why that is spoken like a toward prince
royal commanders be in readiness for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick backing of the duke of york and in the towns as they do march along proclaims him king and many fly to him
darraign your battle for they are at hand
i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent
ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
why that s my fortune too therefore i ll stay
be it with resolution then to fight
my royal father cheer these noble lords and hearten those that fight in your defence
unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george
enter edward george richard warwick norfolk montague and soldiers edward
now perjur d henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field
go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
i am his king and he should bow his knee
i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caus d him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in
and reason too who should succeed the father but the son
ay crook back here i stand to answer thee or any he the proudest of thy sort
twas you that kill d young rutland was it not
ay and old york and yet not satisfied
for god s sake lords give signal to the fight
why how now long tongu d warwick
when you and i met at saint albans last your legs did better service than your hands
then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine
you said so much before and yet you fled
twas not your valour clifford drove me thence
no nor your manhood that durst make you stay
break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my big swol n heart upon that clifford that cruel child killer
i slew thy father call st thou him a child
ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset i ll make thee curse the deed
have done with words my lords and hear me speak
defy them then or else hold close thy lips
i prithee give no limits to my tongue i am a king and privileg d to speak
my liege the wound that bred this meeting here cannot be cur d by words therefore be still
by him that made us all i am resolv d that clifford s manhood lies upon his tongue
say henry shall i have my right or no
a thousand men have broke their fasts to day that ne er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on
if that be right which warwick says is right there is no wrong but every thing is right
whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mother s tongue
but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul misshapen stigmatic mark d by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be call d the sea sham st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy base born heart
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself
helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and ne er was agamemmon s brother wrong d by that false woman as this king by thee
his father revell d in the heart of france and tam d the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he match d according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and grac d thy poor sire with his bridal day even then that sunshine brew d a show r for him that wash d his father s fortunes forth of france and heap d sedition on his crown at home
for what hath broach d this tumult but thy pride
hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slipp d our claim until another age
but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike we ll never leave till we have hewn thee down or bath d thy growing with our heated bloods
and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave and either victory or else a grave
no wrangling woman we ll no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day
a field of battle between towton and saxton in yorkshire alarum excursions
forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes receiv d and many blows repaid have robb d my strong knit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile
smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edward s sun is clouded
our hap is lost our hope but sad despair our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
thy brother s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broach d with the steely point of clifford s lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangor heard from far warwick revenge
so underneath the belly of their steeds that stain d their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost
then let the earth be drunken with our blood
i ll kill my horse because i will not fly
why stand we like soft hearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were play d in jest by counterfeiting actors
here on my knee i vow to god above i ll never pause again never stand still till either death hath clos d these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge
o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
and ere my knee rise from the earth s cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with thy will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
now lords take leave until we meet again where er it be in heaven or in earth
brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms
i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our spring time so
yet let us all together to our troops and give them leave to fly that will not stay and call them pillars that will stand to us and if we thrive promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts for yet is hope of life and victory
forslow no longer make we hence amain
another part of the field excursions
now clifford i have singled thee alone
suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environ d with a brazen wall
now richard i am with thee here alone
this is the hand that stabbed thy father york and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland and here s the heart that triumphs in their death and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother to execute the like upon thyself and so have at thee
they fight enter warwick clifford flies richard
nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death
exeunt scene v another part of the field alarum
enter king henry alone king henry
this battle fares like to the morning s war when dying clouds contend with growing light what time the shepherd blowing of his nails can neither call it perfect day nor night
now sways it this way like a mighty sea forc d by the tide to combat with the wind now sways it that way like the selfsame sea forc d to retire by fury of the wind
sometime the flood prevails and then the wind now one the better then another best both tugging to be victors breast to breast yet neither conqueror nor conquered
so is the equal poise of this fell war
here on this molehill will i sit me down
to whom god will there be the victory
for margaret my queen and clifford too have chid me from the battle swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence
would i were dead if god s good will were so
for what is in this world but grief and woe
methinks it were a happy life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to see the minutes how they run how many makes the hour full complete how many hours brings about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live
when this is known then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will can so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes hours days months and years pass d over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
ah what a life were this
gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than doth a rich embroider d canopy to kings that fear their subjects treachery
o yes it doth a thousand fold it doth
and to conclude the shepherd s homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle his wonted sleep under a fresh tree s shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a prince s delicates his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couched in a curious bed when care mistrust and treason waits on him
enter a son that hath kill d his father at one door and a father that hath kill d his son at another door son
ill blows the wind that profits nobody
this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight may be possessed with some store of crowns and i that haply take them from him now may yet ere night yield both my life and them to some man else as this dead man doth me
it is my father s face whom in this conflict i unwares have kill d
o heavy times begetting such events
from london by the king was i press d forth my father being the earl of warwick s man came on the part of york press d by his master and i who at his hands receiv d my life have by my hands of life bereaved him
pardon me god i knew not what i did
and pardon father for i knew not thee
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks and no more words till they have flow d their fill
whiles lions war and battle for their dens poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
weep wretched man i ll aid thee tear for tear and let our hearts and eyes like civil war be blind with tears and break o ercharg d with grief
enter father bearing of his son father
thou that so stoutly hath resisted me give me thy gold if thou hast any gold for i have bought it with an hundred blows
is this our foeman s face
ah no no no no it is mine only son
ah boy if any life be left in thee throw up thine eye
see see what show rs arise blown with the windy tempest of my heart upon thy wounds that kills mine eye and heart
o pity god this miserable age
what stratagems how fell how butcherly erroneous mutinous and unnatural this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
o boy thy father gave thee life too soon and hath bereft thee of thy life too late
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
o pity pity gentle heaven pity
the red rose and the white are on his face the fatal colours of our striving houses the one his purple blood right well resembles the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
wither one rose and let the other flourish
if you contend a thousand lives must perish
how will my mother for a father s death take on with me and ne er be satisfied
how will my wife for slaughter of my son shed seas of tears and ne er be satisfied
how will the country for these woeful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied
was ever son so rued a father s death
was ever father so bemoan d his son
was ever king so griev d for subjects woe
much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
i ll bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
these arms of mine shall be thy winding sheet my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre for from my heart thine image ne er shall go my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell and so obsequious will thy father be even for the loss of thee having no more as priam was for all his valiant sons
i ll bear thee hence and let them fight that will for i have murdered where i should not kill
exit with the body king henry
sad hearted men much overgone with care here sits a king more woeful than you are
enter queen margaret prince of wales and exeter prince of wales
fly father fly for all your friends are fled and warwick rages like a chafed bull
for death doth hold us in pursuit
mount you my lord towards berwick post amain
edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds having the fearful flying hare in sight with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath and bloody steel grasp d in their ireful hands are at our backs and therefore hence amain
for vengeance comes along with them
nay stay not to expostulate make speed or else come after
nay take me with thee good sweet exeter
not that i fear to stay but love to go whither the queen intends
another part of the field a loud alarum
here burns my candle out ay here it dies which whiles it lasted gave king henry light
o lancaster i fear thy overthrow more than my body s parting with my soul
my love and fear glu d many friends to thee and now i fall thy tough commixture melts impairing henry strength ning misproud york
the common people swarm like summer flies and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
and who shines now but henry s enemies
o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should check thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorch d the earth
and henry hadst thou sway d as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserv d no pity
the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabb d your fathers bosoms split my breast
enter edward george richard montague warwick and soldiers edward
good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
some troops pursue the bloody minded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail fill d with a fretting gust command an argosy to stern the waves
but think you lords that clifford fled with them
no tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard mark d him for the grave and whereso er he is he s surely dead
whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
a deadly groan like life and death s departing
and now the battle s ended if friend or foe let him be gently used
revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford who not contented that he lopp d the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murd ring knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york
from off the gates of york fetch down the head your father s head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room
measure for measure must be answered
bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours
now death shall stop his dismal threat ning sound and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak
i think his understanding is bereft
speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
dark cloudy death o ershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say
tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father
if so thou think st vex him with eager words
clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
clifford devise excuses for thy faults
while we devise fell tortures for thy faults
thou didst love york and i am son to york
thou pitied st rutland i will pity thee
where s captain margaret to fence you now
they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont
nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
i know by that he s dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy two hours life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy
off with the traitor s head and rear it in the place your father s stands
and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned england s royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatt red foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
first will i see the coronation and then to brittany i ll cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord
even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be for in thy shoulder do i build my seat and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
richard i will create thee duke of gloucester and george of clarence warwick as ourself shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester for gloucester s dukedom is too ominous
tut that s a foolish observation
now to london to see these honours in possession
a chase in the north of england enter two keepers with cross bows in their hands first keeper
under this thick grown brake we ll shroud ourselves for through this laund anon the deer will come and in this covert will we make our stand culling the principal of all the deer
i ll stay above the hill so both may shoot
that cannot be the noise of thy cross bow will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
here stand we both and aim we at the best and for the time shall not seem tedious i ll tell thee what befell me on a day in this self place where now we mean to stand
here comes a man let s stay till he be past
enter king henry disguised with a prayer book king henry
from scotland am i stol n even of pure love to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
no harry harry tis no land of thine thy place is fill d thy sceptre wrung from thee thy balm wash d off wherewith thou wast anointed
no bending knee will call thee caesar now no humble suitors press to speak for right no not a man comes for redress of thee for how can i help them and not myself
ay here s a deer whose skin s a keeper s fee
this is the quondam king let s seize upon him
let me embrace thee sour adversity for wise men say it is the wisest course
let us lay hands upon him
forbear awhile we ll hear a little more
my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french king s sister to wife for edward
if this news be true poor queen and son your labour is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
by this account then margaret may win him for she s a woman to be pitied much
her sighs will make a batt ry in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn and nero will be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
ay but she s come to beg warwick to give
she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward
she weeps and says her henry is depos d he smiles and says his edward is install d that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong inferreth arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edward s place
o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went st forlorn
say what art thou that talk st of kings and queens
more than i seem and less than i was born to a man at least for less i should not be and men may talk of kings and why not i
ay but thou talk st as if thou wert a king
why so i am in mind and that s enough
but if thou be a king where is thy crown
my crown is in my heart not on my head not deck d with diamonds and indian stones not to be seen
my crown is call d content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
well if you be a king crown d with content your crown content and you must be contented to go along with us for as we think you are the king king edward hath depos d and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will apprehend you as his enemy
but did you never swear and break an oath
no never such an oath nor will not now
where did you dwell when i was king of england
here in this country where we now remain
i was anointed king at nine months old my father and my grandfather were kings and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me then have you not broke your oaths
no for we were subjects but while you were king
do i not breathe a man
ah simple men you know not what you swear
look as i blow this feather from my face and as the air blows it to me again obeying with my wind when i do blow and yielding to another when it blows commanded always by the greater gust such is the lightness of you common men
but do not break your oaths for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
go where you will the king shall be commanded and be you kings command and i ll obey
we are true subjects to the king king edward
so would you be again to henry if he were seated as king edward is
we charge you in god s name and the king s to go with us unto the officers
in god s name lead your king s name be obey d and what god will that let your king perform and what he will i humbly yield unto
the palace enter king edward gloucester clarence and lady grey king edward
brother of gloucester at saint albans field this lady s husband sir richard grey was slain his land then seiz d on by the conqueror
her suit is now to repossess those lands which we in justice cannot well deny because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life
your highness shall do well to grant her suit it were dishonour to deny it her
it were no less but yet i ll make a pause
aside to clarence yea is it so
i see the lady hath a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit
aside to gloucester he knows the game how true he keeps the wind
widow we will consider of your suit and come some other time to know our mind
right gracious lord i cannot brook delay
may it please your highness to resolve me now and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me
then i ll warrant you all your lands an if what pleases him shall pleasure you
fight closer or good faith you ll catch a blow
aside to gloucester i fear her not unless she chance to fall
aside to clarence god forbid that for he ll take vantages
how many children hast thou widow tell me
aside to gloucester i think he means to beg a child of her
aside to clarence nay then whip me he ll rather give her two
aside you shall have four if you ll be rul d by him
twere pity they should lose their father s lands
be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
lords give us leave i ll try this widow s wit
aside ay good leave have you for you will have leave till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch
gloucester and clarence withdraw king edward
now tell me madam do you love your children
ay full as dearly as i love myself
and would you not do much to do them good
to do them good i would sustain some harm
then get your husband s lands to do them good
therefore i came unto your majesty
i ll tell you how these lands are to be got
so shall you bind me to your highness service
what service wilt thou do me if i give them
what you command that rests in me to do
but you will take exceptions to my boon
no gracious lord except i cannot do it
ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask
why then i will do what your grace commands
he plies her hard and much rain wears the marble
nay then her wax must melt
shall i not hear my task
an easy task tis but to love a king
that s soon perform d because i am a subject
why then thy husband s lands i freely give thee
i take my leave with many thousand thanks
the match is made she seals it with a curtsy
but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean
the fruits of love i mean my loving liege
ay but i fear me in another sense
what love thinkst thou i sue so much to get
my love till death my humble thanks my prayers that love which virtue begs and virtue grants
no by my troth i did not mean such love
why then you mean not as i thought you did
but now you partly may perceive my mind
my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at if i aim aright
to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee
to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison
why then thou shalt not have thy husband s lands
why then mine honesty shall be my dower for by that loss i will not purchase them
therein thou wrong st thy children mightily
herein your highness wrongs both them and me
but mighty lord this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit
please you dismiss me either with ay or no
ay if thou wilt say ay to my request no if thou dost say no to my demand
my suit is at an end
the widow likes him not she knits her brows
he is the bluntest wooer in christendom
aside her looks doth argue her replete with modesty her words doth show her wit incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty
one way or other she is for a king and she shall be my love or else my queen
say that king edward take thee for his queen
tis better said than done my gracious lord
i am a subject fit to jest withal but far unfit to be a sovereign
sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love
and that is more than i will yield unto
i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be your concubine
you cavil widow i did mean my queen
twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
king edward no more than when my daughters call thee mother
thou art a widow and thou hast some children and by god s mother i being but a bachelor have other some
why tis a happy thing to be the father unto many sons
answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
the ghostly father now hath done his shrift
when he was made a shriver twas for shrift
brothers you muse what chat we two have had
the widow likes it not for she looks very sad
you d think it strange if i should marry her
that would be ten days wonder at the least
that s a day longer than a wonder lasts
by so much is the wonder in extremes
well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband s lands
my gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate
see that he be convey d unto the tower
and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension
ay edward will use women honourably
would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for
and yet between my soul s desire and me the lustful edward s title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlook d for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself
a cold premeditation for my purpose
why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a far off shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he ll lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say i ll cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities
my eye s too quick my heart o erweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them
well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford
i ll make my heaven in a lady s lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
why love forswore me in my mother s womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a wither d shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlick d bear whelp that carries no impression like the dam
and am i then a man to be belov d
o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to check to o erbear such as are of better person than myself i ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live t account this world but hell until my misshap d trunk that bear this head be round impaled with a glorious crown
and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe
why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content
to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions
i ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall i ll slay more gazers than the basilisk i ll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy
i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with protheus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school
can i do this and cannot get a crown
tut were it farther off i ll pluck it down
enter lewis the french king his sister bona his admiral call d bourbon prince edward queen margaret and the earl of oxford
lewis sits and riseth up again lewis
fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us
it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
now margaret must strike her sail and learn a while to serve where kings command
i was i must confess great albion s queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself
why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drown d in cares
whate er it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side
seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortune s yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance
be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eas d if france can yield relief
those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak
now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banish d man and forc d to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england s true anointed lawful king
this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henry s heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done
scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasure seiz d our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off
the more we stay the stronger grows our foe
the more i stay the more i ll succour thee
o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
what s he approacheth boldly to our presence
our earl of warwick edward s greatest friend
ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide
from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to england s king in lawful marriage
aside if that go forward henry s hope is done
to bona and gracious madam in our king s behalf i am commanded with your leave and favour humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign s heart where fame late ent ring at his heedful ears hath plac d thy beauty s image and thy virtue
king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick
his demand springs not from edward s well meant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henry s son
look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule a while yet heav ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs
because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more art prince than she is queen
then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france
from these our henry lineally descends
oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry the fifth had gotten
methinks these peers of france should smile at that
but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom s worth
why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyed st thirty and six years and not betray thy treason with a blush
can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
leave henry and call edward king
call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellow d years when nature brought him to the door of death
no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster
and i the house of york
queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick
heavens grant that warwick s words bewitch him not
now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king
for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen
thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour
but is he gracious in the people s eye
the more that henry was unfortunate
then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona
such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself
myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fix d in virtue s ground the leaves and fruit maintain d with beauty s sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain
now sister let us hear your firm resolve
your grant or your denial shall be mine
to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your king s desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
then warwick thus our sister shall be edward s
and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpois d
draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king
to edward but not to the english king
deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit
before thy coming lewis was henry s friend
and still is friend to him and margaret
but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edward s good success then tis but reason that i be releas d from giving aid which late i promised
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield
henry now lives in scotland at his case where having nothing nothing can he lose
and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france
peace impudent and shameless warwick proud setter up and puller down of kings
i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord s false love for both of you are birds of self same feather
post blowing a horn within lewis
warwick this is some post to us or thee
my lord ambassador these letters are for you sent from your brother marquis montague
these from our king unto your majesty
and madam these for you from whom i know not
they all read their letters oxford
i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his
nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled
i hope all s for the best
mine such as fill my heart with unhop d joys
mine full of sorrow and heart s discontent
what has your king married the lady grey
and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience
is this th alliance that he seeks with france
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
i told your majesty as much before
this proveth edward s love and warwick s honesty
king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edward s no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame
did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death
did i let pass th abuse done to my niece
did i impale him with the regal crown
did i put henry from his native right
and am i guerdon d at the last with shame
for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry
my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor
i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state
warwick these words have turn d my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becom st king henry s friend
so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers i ll undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war
tis not his new made bride shall succour him and as for clarence as my letters tell me he s very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country
dear brother how shall bona be reveng d but by thy help to this distressed queen
renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair
my quarrel and this english queen s are one
and mine fair lady bona joins with yours
and mine with hers and thine and margaret s
therefore at last i firmly am resolv d you shall have aid
let me give humble thanks for all at once
then england s messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride
thou seest what s past go fear thy king withal
tell him in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake
tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long
there s thy reward be gone
but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree i ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
yes i agree and thank you for your motion
son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwick s daughter shall be thine
yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
he gives his hand to warwick lewis
these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shall waft them over with our royal fleet
i long till edward fall by war s mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france
i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand
had he none else to make a stale but me
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
i was the chief that rais d him to the crown and i ll be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry s misery but seek revenge on edward s mockery
the palace enter gloucester clarence somerset and montague gloucester
now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey
hath not our brother made a worthy choice
alas you know tis far from hence to france
how could he stay till warwick made return
my lords forbear this talk here comes the king
enter king edward attended lady grey as queen pembroke stafford hastings and others
four stand on one side and four on the other gloucester
i mind to tell him plainly what i think
now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent
as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they ll take no offence at our abuse
suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwick s and must have my will
and shall have your will because our king
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
yea brother richard are you offended too
no god forbid that i should wish them sever d whom god hath join d together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together
setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england s queen
and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think
then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona
and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage
what if both lewis and warwick be appeas d by such invention as i can devise
yet to have join d with france in such alliance would more have strength ned this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage
why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself
but the safer when tis back d with france
tis better using france than trusting france
let us be back d with god and with the seas which he hath giv n for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves
in them and in ourselves our safety lies
for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford
it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law
and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride
she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood
or else you would not have bestow d the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife s son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
is it for a wife that thou art malcontent
in choosing for yourself you show d your judgment which being shallow you shall give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you
leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother s will
my lords before it pleas d his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune
but as this title honours me and mine so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey
nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
aside i hear yet say not much but think the more
now messenger what letters or what news from france
my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate
go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters
at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward the supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride
but what said lady bona to my marriage
these were her words utt red with mild disdain tell him in hope he ll prove a widower shortly i ll wear the willow garland for his sake
i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong
but what said henry s queen
for i have heard that she was there in place
tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on
belike she minds to play the amazon
but what said warwick to these injuries
he more incens d against your majesty than all the rest discharg d me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long
durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
well i will arm me being thus forewarn d
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
but say is warwick friends with margaret
ay gracious sovereign they are so link d in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick s daughter
belike the elder clarence will have the younger
now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick s other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself
you that love me and warwick follow me
my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown
clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
yet am i arm d against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desp rate case
pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed
myself in person will straight follow you
exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt
you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance
tell me if you love warwick more than me
if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends
but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect
so god help montague as he proves true
and hastings as he favours edward s cause
now brother richard will you stand by us
ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
then am i sure of victory
now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign pow r
a plain in warwickshire enter warwick and oxford with french soldiers warwick
trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us
enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence comes
speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset
i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn d an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edward s brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
and now what rests but in night s coverture thy brother being carelessly encamp d his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well cover d with the night s black mantle at unawares may beat down edward s guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him
you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader
why then let s on our way in silent sort
for warwick and his friends god and saint george
edward s camp near warwick enter three watchmen to guard the king s tent first watchman
come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep
what will he not to bed
why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress d
to morrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report
but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent
tis the lord hastings the king s chiefest friend
but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field
tis the more honour because more dangerous
ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than dangerous honour
if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him
unless our halberds did shut up his passage
ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from night foes
enter warwick clarence oxford somerset and french soldiers silent all warwick
this is his tent and see where stand his guard
but follow me and edward shall be ours
warwick and the rest cry all warwick
and set upon the guard who fly crying arm
warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding re enter warwick and the rest bringing the king out in his gown sitting in a chair
gloucester and hastings fly over the stage somerset
what are they that fly there
let them go here is the duke
why warwick when we parted thou call dst me king
ay but the case is alter d
when you disgrac d me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york
alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the people s welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
yea brother of clarence art thou here too
nay then i see that edward needs must down
yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king
though fortune s malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
then for his mind be edward england s king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be convey d unto my brother archbishop of york
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows i ll follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him
now for a while farewell good duke of york
what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide
they lead him out forcibly oxford
what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers
ay that s the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne
the palace enter queen elizabeth and rivers rivers
madam what makes you in this sudden change
why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befall n king edward
what loss of some pitch d battle against warwick
no but the loss of his own royal person
ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betray d by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surpris d at unawares and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwick s brother and by that our foe
these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now hath won the day
till then fair hope must hinder life s decay
and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edward s offspring in my womb
this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortune s cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of blood sucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edward s fruit true heir to th english crown
but madam where is warwick then become
i am inform d that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henry s head
guess thou the rest king edward s friends must down
but to prevent the tyrant s violence for trust not him that hath once broken faith i ll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edward s right
there shall i rest secure from force and fraud
come therefore let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die
exeunt scene v a park near middleham castle in yorkshire enter gloucester lord hastings sir william stanley and others gloucester
now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park
thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself
i have advertis d him by secret means that if about this hour he make this way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity
enter king edward and a huntsman with him huntsman
this way my lord for this way lies the game
now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishop s deer
brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the park corner
to lynn my lord and shipt from thence to flanders
well guess d believe me for that was my meaning
stanley i will requite thy forwardness
better do so than tarry and be hang d
come then away let s ha no more ado
shield thee from warwick s frown and pray that i may repossess the crown
enter king henry clarence warwick somerset young henry earl of richmond oxford montague lieutenant of the tower and attendants king henry
master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turn d my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees
subjects may challenge nothing of their sov reigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty
nay be thou sure i ll well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty
but warwick after god thou set st me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument
therefore that i may conquer fortune s spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish d with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
your grace hath still been fam d for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortune s malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place
no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heav ns in thy nativity adjudg d an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent
and i choose clarence only for protector
warwick and clarence give me both your hands
now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government
i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sin s rebuke and my creator s praise
what answers clarence to his sovereign s will
that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself
why then though loath yet must i be content
we ll yoke together like a double shadow to henry s body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease
and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounc d a traitor and all his lands and goods confiscated
and that succession be determin d
ay therein clarence shall not want his part
but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclips d
it shall be done my sovereign with all speed
my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care
my liege it is young henry earl of richmond
lays his hand on his head if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our country s bliss
his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature fram d to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne
make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me
that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy
he was convey d by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishop s huntsmen rescu d him for hunting was his daily exercise
my brother was too careless of his charge
but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide
exeunt all but somerset richmond and oxford somerset
my lord i like not of this flight of edward s for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars befor t be long
as henry s late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours
therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith we ll send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity
ay for if edward repossess the crown tis like that richmond with the rest shall down
it shall be so he shall to brittany
come therefore let s about it speedily
enter king edward gloucester hastings and soldiers king edward
now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for henry s regal crown
well have we pass d and now repass d the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains we being thus arriv d from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york but that we enter as into our dukedom
brother i like not this for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within
tush man abodements must not now affright us
by fair or foul means we must enter in for hither will our friends repair to us
my liege i ll knock once more to summon them
enter on the walls the mayor of york and his brethren mayor
my lords we were forewarned of your coming and shut the gates for safety of ourselves for now we owe allegiance unto henry
but master mayor if henry be your king yet edward at the least is duke of york
true my good lord i know you for no less
why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom as being well content with that alone
aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose he ll soon find means to make the body follow
why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
open the gates we are king henry s friends
the gates shall then be open d
a wise stout captain and soon persuaded
the good old man would fain that all were well so twere not long of him but being ent red i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason
enter below the mayor and two aldermen king edward
these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war
fear not man but yield me up the keys takes his keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me
enter montgomery with drum and soldiers gloucester
brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceiv d
but why come you in arms
to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do
thanks good montgomery but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest
then fare you well for i will hence again
i came to serve a king and not a duke
drummer strike up and let us march away
the drum begins to march king edward
nay stay sir john a while and we ll debate by what safe means the crown may be recover d
in few words if you ll not here proclaim yourself our king i ll leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succour you
why shall we fight if you pretend no title
why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
when we grow stronger then we ll make our claim till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
brother we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends
then be it as you will for tis my right and henry but usurps the diadem
ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself and now will i be edward s champion
sound trumpet edward shall be here proclaim d
come fellow soldier make thou proclamation
reads edward the fourth by the grace of god king of england and france and lord of ireland c montgomery
and whoso er gainsays king edward s right by this i challenge him to single fight
thanks brave montgomery and thanks unto you all if fortune serve me i ll requite this kindness
now for this night let s harbour here in york and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon we ll forward towards warwick and his mates for well i wot that henry is no soldier
ah froward clarence how evil it beseems the to flatter henry and forsake thy brother
yet as we may we ll meet both thee and warwick
come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day and that once gotten doubt not of large pay
enter king henry warwick montague clarence oxford and exeter warwick
edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath pass d in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people flock to him
let s levy men and beat him back again
a little fire is quickly trodden out which being suffer d rivers cannot quench
in warwickshire i have true hearted friends not mutinous in peace yet bold in war those will i muster up and thou son clarence shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent the knights and gentlemen to come with thee
thou brother montague in buckingham northampton and in leicestershire shalt find men well inclin d to hear what thou command st
and thou brave oxford wondrous well belov d in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
my sovereign with the loving citizens like to his island girt in with the ocean or modest dian circled with her nymphs shall rest in london till we come to him
fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
farewell my hector and my troy s true hope
in sign of truth i kiss your highness hand
well minded clarence be thou fortunate
comfort my lord and so i take my leave
kissing the king s band and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu
sweet oxford and my loving montague and all at once once more a happy farewell
farewell sweet lords let s meet at coventry
exeunt all but the king and exeter king henry
here at the palace will i rest a while
cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship
methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine
the doubt is that he will seduce the rest
that s not my fear my meed hath got me fame i have not stopp d mine ears to their demands nor posted off their suits with slow delays my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allay d their swelling griefs my mercy dried their water flowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppress d them with great subsidies nor forward of revenge though they much err d
then why should they love edward more than me
no exeter these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb the lamb will never cease to follow him
enter king edward gloucester and soldiers king edward
seize on the shame fac d henry bear him hence and once again proclaim us king of england
you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry and swell so much the higher by their ebb
hence with him to the tower let him not speak
exeunt some with king henry and lords towards coventry bend we our course where peremptory warwick now remains
the sun shines hot and if we use delay cold biting winter mars our hop d for hay

brave warriors march amain towards coventry
exeunt act v scene i coventry enter warwick the mayor of coventry two messengers and others upon the walls warwick

how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow
by this at dunsmore marching hitherward
how far off is our brother montague
where is the post that came from montague
by this at daintry with a puissant troop
say somerville what says my loving son
and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now
at southam i did leave him with his forces and do expect him here some two hours hence
then clarence is at hand i hear his drum
it is not his my lord here southam lies
the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick
they are at hand and you shall quickly know
enter king edward gloucester and soldiers king edward
go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
see how the surly warwick mans the wall
where slept our scouts or how are they seduc d that we could hear no news of his repair
now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee call edward king and at his hands beg mercy
and he shall pardon thee these outrages
nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence confess who set thee up and pluck d thee down call warwick patron and be penitent
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york
i thought at least he would have said the king or did he make the jest against his will
is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
i ll do thee service for so good a gift
twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother
why then tis mine if but by warwick s gift
thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling warwick takes his gift again and henry is my king warwick his subject
but warwick s king is edward s prisoner
and gallant warwick do but answer this what is the body when the head is off
alas that warwick had no more forecast but whiles he thought to steal the single ten the king was slily finger d from the deck
you left poor henry at the bishop s palace and ten to one you ll meet him in the tower
tis even so yet you are warwick still
come warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
strike now or else the iron cools
i had rather chop this hand off at a blow and with the other fling it at thy face than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend this hand fast wound about thy coal black hair shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off write in the dust this sentence with thy blood wind changing warwick now can change no more
enter oxford with drum and colours warwick
he and his forces enter the city gloucester
the gates are open let us enter too
so other foes may set upon our backs
stand we in good array for they no doubt will issue out again and bid us battle if not the city being but of small defence we ll quietly rouse the traitors in the same
enter montague with drum and colours montague
he and his forces enter the city gloucester
thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason even with the dearest blood your bodies bear
the harder match d the greater victory
my mind presageth happy gain and conquest
enter somerset with drum and colours somerset
he and his forces enter the city gloucester

enter clarence with drum and colours warwick
and lo where george of clarence sweeps along of force enough to bid his brother battle with whom an upright zeal to right prevails more than the nature of a brother s love
et tu brute wilt thou stab caesar too
a parley sirrah to george of clarence
taking the red rose from his hat and throwing it at warwick father of warwick know you what this means
look here i throw my infamy at thee
i will not ruinate my father s house who gave his blood to lime the stones together and set up lancaster
why trowest thou warwick that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
to keep that oath were more impiety than jephtha when he sacrific d his daughter
i am so sorry for my trespass made that to deserve well at my brother s hands i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe with resolution whereso er i meet thee as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
and so proud hearted warwick i defy thee and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
pardon me edward i will make amends and richard do not frown upon my faults for i will henceforth be no more unconstant
now welcome more and ten times more belov d than if thou never hadst deserv d our hate
welcome good clarence this is brother like
o passing traitor perjur d and unjust
what warwick wilt thou leave die town and fight
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
alas i am not coop d here for defence
i will away towards barnet presently and bid thee battle edward if thou dar st
yes warwick edward dares and leads the way
lords to the field saint george and victory
warwick and his company follow scene ii
a field of battle near barnet alarum and excursions
enter king edward bringing forth warwick wounded king edward
die thou and die our fear for warwick was a bug that fear d us all
now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwick s bones may keep thine company
come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick
my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe
thus yields the cedar to the axe s edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose top branch overpeer d jove s spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter s pow rful wind
these eyes that now are dimm d with death s black veil have been as piercing as the mid day sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now fill d with blood were lik ned oft to kingly sepulchres for who liv d king but i could dig his grave
and who durst smile when warwick bent his brow
lo now my glory smear d in dust and blood
my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body s length
what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
and live we how we can yet die we must
wert thou as we are we might recover all our loss again
the queen from france hath brought a puissant power even now we heard the news
why then i would not fly
ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand and with thy lips keep in my soul a while
thou lov st me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak
come quickly montague or i am dead
montague hath breath d his last and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick and said commend me to my valiant brother
and more he would have said and more he spoke which sounded like a clamour in a vault that mought not be distinguish d but at last i well might hear delivered with a groan o farewell warwick
fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
away away to meet the queen s great power
here they bear away his body scene iii

thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are grac d with wreaths of victory
but in the midst of this bright shining day i spy a black suspicious threat ning cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath rais d in gallia have arriv d our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us
a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came thy very beams will dry those vapours up for every cloud engenders not a storm
the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her
if she have time to breathe be well assur d her faction will be full as strong as ours
are advertis d by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewksbury we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along

what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holding anchor lost and half our sailors swallow d in the flood yet lives our pilot still
is t meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have sav d
ah what a fault were this
say warwick was our anchor what of that
and montague our top mast what of him
our slaught red friends the tackles what of these
why is not oxford here another anchor
the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings
and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allow d the skilful pilot s charge
we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck as good to chide the waves as speak them fair
and what is edward but a ruthless sea
what clarence but a quicksand of deceit
and richard but a ragged fatal rock
all these the enemies to our poor bark
say you can swim alas tis but a while
tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish that s a threefold death
this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that there s no hop d for mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
what cannot be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward hear her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms
i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of the like spirit to himself
if any such be here as god forbid let him depart before we need his help
women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint
thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee
long mayst thou eve to bear his image and renew his glories
and he that will not fight for such a hope go home to bed and like the owl by day if he arise be mock d and wond red at
thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks
and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else
prepare you lords for edward is at hand ready to fight therefore be resolute
it is his policy to haste thus fast to find us unprovided

what can so young a man begin to prick
edward what satisfaction canst thou make for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects and all the trouble thou hast turn d me to
speak like a subject proud ambitious york
suppose that i am now my father s mouth resign thy chair and where i stand kneel thou whilst i propose the self same words to the which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to
ah that thy father had been so resolv d
that you might still have worn the petticoat and ne er have stol n the breech from lancaster
let aesop fable in a winter s night his currish riddle sorts not with this place
by heaven brat i ll plague ye for that word
ay thou wast born to be a plague to men
for god s sake take away this captive scold
nay take away this scolding crookback rather
peace wilful boy or i will charm your tongue
untutor d lad thou art too malapert
i know my duty you are all undutiful
lascivious edward and thou perjur d george and thou misshapen dick i tell ye all i am your better traitors as ye are and thou usurp st my father s right and mine
take that the likeness of this railer here
take that to end thy agony
and there s for twitting me with perjury
offers to kill her king edward
hold richard hold for we have done to much
why should she live to fill the world with words
clarence excuse me to the king my brother
i ll hence to london on a serious matter ere ye come there be sure to hear some news
o ned sweet ned speak to thy mother boy
they that stabb d caesar shed no blood at all did not offend nor were not worthy blame if this foul deed were by to equal it
he was a man this in respect a child and men ne er spend their fury on a child
what s worse than murderer that i may name it
no no my heart will burst an if i speak and i will speak that so my heart may burst
how sweet a plant have you untimely cropp d
you have no children butchers if you had the thought of them would have stirr d up remorse
but if you ever chance to have a child look in his youth to have him so cut off as deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince
away with her go bear her hence perforce
nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
here sheathe thy sword i ll pardon thee my death
by heaven i will not do thee so much ease
good clarence do sweet clarence do thou do it
didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it

what at your book so hard
ay my good lord my lord i should say rather
tis sin to flatter good was little better
good gloucester and good devil were alike and both preposterous therefore not good lord
sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer
so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butcher s knife
what scene of death hath roscius now to act
suspicion always haunts the guilty mind the thief doth fear each bush an officer
the bird that hath been limed in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush and i the hapless male to one sweet bird have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was lim d was caught and kill d
why what a peevish fool was that of crete that taught his son the office of a fowl
and yet for all his wings the fool was drown d
i daedalus my poor boy icarus thy father minos that denied our course the sun that sear d the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
my breast can better brook thy dagger s point than can my ears that tragic history
think st thou i am an executioner
a persecutor i am sure thou art
if murdering innocents be executing why then thou are an executioner
thy son i kill d for his presumption
hadst thou been kill d when first thou didst presume thou hadst not liv d to kill a son of mine
and thus i prophesy that many a thousand which now mistrust no parcel of my fear and many an old man s sigh and many a widow s and many an orphan s water standing eye men for their sons wives for their husbands orphans for their parents timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
the owl shriek d at thy birth an evil sign the night crow cried aboding luckless time dogs howl d and hideous tempest shook down trees the raven rook d her on the chimney s top and chatt ring pies in dismal discords sung thy mother felt more than a mother s pain and yet brought forth less than a mother s hope to wit an indigest deformed lump not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born to signify thou cam st to bite the world and if the rest be true which i have heard thou cam st gloucester
stabs him for this amongst the rest was i ordain d
ay and for much more slaughter after this
o god forgive my sins and pardon thee
what will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground
i thought it would have mounted
see how my sword weeps for the poor king s death
o may such purple tears be always shed from those that wish the downfall of our house
if any spark of life be yet remaining down down to hell and say i sent thee thither stabs him again i that have neither pity love nor fear
indeed tis true that henry told me of for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward
had i not reason think ye to make haste and seek their ruin that usurp d our right
the midwife wonder d and the women cried o jesus bless us he is born with teeth
and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
then since the heavens have shap d my body so let hell make crook d my mind to answer it
i have no brother i am like no brother and this word love which greybeards call divine be resident in men like one another and not in me
clarence beware thou keep st me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee for i will buzz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life and then to purge his fear i ll be thy death
king henry and the prince his son are gone
clarence thy turn is next and then the rest counting myself but bad till i be best
i ll throw thy body in another room and triumph henry in thy day of doom

what will your grace have done with margaret
reignier her father to the king of france hath pawn d the sicils and jerusalem and hither have they sent it for her ransom
away with her and waft her hence to france
and now what rests but that we spend the time with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows such as befits the pleasure of the court
for here i hope begins our lasting joy
i come no more to make you laugh things now that bear a weighty and a serious brow sad high and working full of state and woe such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow we now present
those that can pity here may if they think it well let fall a tear the subject will deserve it
such as give their money out of hope they may believe may here find truth too
those that come to see only a show or two and so agree the play may pass if they be still and willing i ll undertake may see away their shilling richly in two short hours
only they that come to hear a merry bawdy play a noise of targets or to see a fellow in a long motley coat guarded with yellow will be deceiv d for gentle hearers know to rank our chosen truth with such a show as fool and fight is beside forfeiting our own brains and the opinion that we bring to make that only true we now intend will leave us never an understanding friend
therefore for goodness sake and as you are known the first and happiest hearers of the town be sad as we would make ye
think ye see the very persons of our noble story as they were living think you see them great and follow d with the general throng and sweat of thousand friends then in a moment see how soon this mightiness meets misery
and if you can be merry then i ll say a man may weep upon his wedding day
the palace enter the duke of norfolk at one door at the other the duke of buckingham and the lord abergavenny buckingham
how have ye done since last we saw in france
i thank your grace healthful and ever since a fresh admirer of what i saw there
an untimely ague stay d me a prisoner in my chamber when those suns of glory those two lights of men met in the vale of andren
twixt guynes and arde i was then present saw them salute on horseback beheld them when they lighted how they clung in their embracement as they grew together which had they what four thron d ones could have weigh d such a compounded one
all the whole time i was my chamber s prisoner
then you lost the view of earthly glory men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itself
each following day became the next day s master till the last made former wonders its
to day the french all clinquant all in gold like heathen gods shone down the english and to morrow they made britain india every man that stood show d like a mine
their dwarfish pages were as cherubins an gilt the madams too not us d to toil did almost sweat to bear the pride upon them that their very labour was to them as a painting
now this masque was cried incomparable and th ensuing night made it a fool and beggar
the two kings equal in lustre were now best now worst as presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both twas said they saw but one and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure
when these suns for so they phrase em by their heralds challeng d the noble spirits to arms they did perform beyond thought s compass that former fabulous story being now seen possible enough got credit that bevis was believ d
as i belong to worship and affect in honour honesty the tract of ev rything would by a good discourser lose some life which action s self was tongue to
all was royal to the disposing of it nought rebell d order gave each thing view
the office did distinctly his full function
who did guide i mean who set the body and the limbs of this great sport together as you guess
one certes that promises no element in such a business
i pray you who my lord
all this was ord red by the good discretion of the right reverend cardinal of york
no man s pie is freed from his ambitious finger
what had he to do in these fierce vanities
i wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk take up the rays o th beneficial sun and keep it from the earth
surely sir there s in him stuff that puts him to these ends for being not propp d by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor call d upon for high feats done to th crown neither allied to eminent assistants but spider like out of his self drawing web a gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives for him which buys a place next to the king
i cannot tell what heaven hath given him let some graver eye pierce into that but i can see his pride peep through each part of him
if not from hell the devil is a niggard or has given all before and he begins a new hell in himself
why the devil upon this french going out took he upon him without the privity o th king t appoint who should attend on him
he makes up the file of all the gentry for the most part such to whom as great a charge as little honour he meant to lay upon and his own letter the honourable board of council out must fetch him in he papers
i do know kinsmen of mine three at the least that have by this so sicken d their estates that never they shall abound as formerly
o many have broke their backs with laying manors on em for this great journey
what did this vanity but minister communication of a most poor issue
grievingly i think the peace between the french and us not values the cost that did conclude it
every man after the hideous storm that follow d was a thing inspir d and not consulting broke into a general prophecy that this tempest dashing the garment of this peace aboded the sudden breach on t
which is budded out for france hath flaw d the league and hath attach d our merchants goods at bordeaux
is it therefore th ambassador is silenc d
a proper tide of a peace and purchas d at a superfluous rate
why all this business our reverend cardinal carried
like it your grace the state takes notice of the private difference betwixt you and the cardinal
i advise you and take it from a heart that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safety that you read the cardinal s malice and his potency together to consider further that what his high hatred would effect wants not a minister in his power
you know his nature that he s revengeful and i know his sword hath a sharp edge it s long and t may be said it reaches far and where twill not extend thither he darts it
bosom up my counsel you ll find it wholesome
lo where comes that rock that i advise your shunning
enter cardinal wolsey the purse borne before him certain of the guard and two secretaries with papers

exeunt wolsey and his train buckingham

ask god for temp rance that s th appliance only which your disease requires
i read in s looks matter against me and his eye revil d me as his abject object
at this instant he bores me with some trick
he s gone to th king i ll follow and outstare him
stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what tis you go about
to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first
anger is like a full hot horse who being allow d his way self mettle tires him
not a man in england can advise me like you be to yourself as you would to your friend
i ll to the king and from a mouth of honour quite cry down this ipswich fellow s insolence or proclaim there s difference in no persons
be advis d heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself
we may outrun by violent swiftness that which we run at and lose by over running
know you not the fire that mounts the liquor till t run o er in seeming to augment it wastes it
i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion
sir i am thankful to you and i ll go along by your prescription but this top proud fellow whom from the flow of gan i name not but from sincere motions by intelligence and proofs as clear as founts in july when we see each grain of gravel i do know to be corrupt and treasonous
to th king i ll say t and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock
attend this holy fox or wolf or both for he is equal rav nous as he is subtle and as prone to mischief as able to perform t his mind and place infecting one another yea reciprocally only to show his pomp as well in france as here at home suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty th interview that swallowed so much treasure and like a glass did break i th wrenching
pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal the articles o th combination drew as himself pleas d and they were ratified as he cried thus let be to as much end as give a crutch to th dead
but our count cardinal has done this and tis well for worthy wolsey who cannot err he did it
let the king know as soon he shall by me that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour as he pleases and for his own advantage
i am sorry to hear this of him and could wish he were something mistaken in t
no not a syllable i do pronounce him in that very shape he shall appear in proof

i shall perish under device and practice
i am sorry to see you ta en from liberty to look on the business present tis his highness pleasure you shall to th tower
it will help nothing to plead mine innocence for that dye is on me which makes my whit st part black
the will of heav n be done in this and all things
o my lord aberga ny fare you well
nay he must bear you company
to abergavenny the king is pleas d you shall to th tower till you know how he determines further
as the duke said the will of heaven be done and the king s pleasure by me obey d
here is warrant from the king t attach lord montacute and the bodies of the duke s confessor john de la car one gilbert peck his chancellor buckingham

let be call d before us that gentleman of buckingham s
in person i ll hear his confessions justify and point by point the treasons of his master he shall again relate
a noise within crying room for the queen
enter the queen usher d by the dukes of norfolk and suffolk she kneels

nay we must longer kneel i am suitor
arise and take place by us
half your suit never name to us you have half our power
the other moiety ere you ask is given repeat your will and take it
that you would love yourself and in that love not unconsidered leave your honour nor the dignity of your office is the point of my petition
i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among em which hath flaw d the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soil even he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion
not almost appears it doth appear for upon these taxations the clothiers all not able to maintain the many to them longing have put of the spinsters carders fullers weavers who unfit for other life compell d by hunger and lack of other means in desperate manner daring th event to th teeth are all in uproar and danger serves among them
my lord cardinal you that are blam d for it alike with us know you of this taxation
please you sir i know but of a single part in aught pertains to th state and front but in that file where others tell steps with me
you know no more than others
but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance
these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to th hearing and to bear em the back is sacrifice to th load
they say they are devis d by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation
in what kind let s know is this exaction
i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am bold ned under your promis d pardon
the subjects grief comes through commissions which compels from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is nam d your wars in france
this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and it s come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will
i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business
by my life this is against our pleasure
and for me i have no further gone in this than by a single voice and that not pass d me but by learned approbation of the judges
if i am traduc d by ignorant tongues which neither know my faculties nor person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say tis but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through
we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as rav nous fishes do a vessel follow that is new trimm d but benefit no further than vainly longing
what we oft do best by sick interpreters once weak ones is not ours or not allow d what worst as oft hitting a grosser quality is cried up for our best act
if we shall stand still in fear our motion will be mock d or carp d at we should take root here where we sit or sit state statues only
things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear things done without example in their issue are to be fear d
have you a precedent of this commission
we must not rend our subjects from our laws and stick them in our will
why we take from every tree lop bark and part o th timber and though we leave it with a root thus hack d the air will drink the sap
to every county where this is question d send our letters with free pardon to each man that has denied the force of this commission
pray look tot i put it to your care
aside to the secretary a word with you
let there be letters writ to every shire of the king s grace and pardon
the grieved commons hardly conceive of me let it be nois d that through our intercession this revokement and pardon comes
i shall anon advise you further in the proceeding
exit secretary enter surveyor queen katharine
i am sorry that the duke of buckingham is run in your displeasure
the gentleman is learn d and a most rare speaker to nature none more bound his training such that he may furnish and instruct great teachers and never seek for aid out of himself
yet see when these so noble benefits shall prove not well dispos d the mind growing once corrupt they turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly than ever they were fair
this man so complete who was enroll d mongst wonders and when we almost with ravish d list ning could not find his hour of speech a minute he my lady hath into monstrous habits put the graces that once were his and is become as black as if besmear d in hell
sit by us you shall hear this was his gentleman in trust of him things to strike honour sad
bid him recount the fore recited practices whereof we cannot feel too little hear too much
stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you most like a careful subject have collected out of the duke of buckingham
first it was usual with him every day it would infect his speech that if the king should without issue die he ll carry it so to make the sceptre his
these very words i ve heard him utter to his son in law lord aberga ny to whom by oath he menac d revenge upon the cardinal
please your highness note this dangerous conception in this point not friended by his wish to your high person his will is most malignant and it stretches beyond you to your friends
my learn d lord cardinal deliver all with charity
how grounded he his title to the crown upon our fail
to this point hast thou heard him at any time speak aught
he was brought to this by a vain prophecy of nicholas henton
sir a chartreux friar his confessor who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty
not long before your highness sped to france the duke being at the rose within the parish saint lawrence poultney did of me demand what was the speech among the londoners concerning the french journey
i replied men fear d the french would prove perfidious to the king s danger
if i know you well you were the duke s surveyor and lost your office on the complaint o th tenants
take good heed you charge not in your spleen a noble person and spoil your nobler soul
i say take heed yes heartily beseech you
on my soul i ll speak but truth
i told my lord the duke by th devil s illusions the monk might be deceiv d and that twas dangerous for him to ruminate on this so far until it forg d him some design which being believ d it was much like to do
he answer d tush it can do me no damage adding further that had the king in his last sickness fail d the cardinal s and sir thomas lovell s heads should have gone off
there s mischief in this man
being at greenwich after your highness had reprov d the duke about sir william bulmer king
i remember of such a time being my sworn servant the duke retain d him his
if quoth he i for this had been committed as to the tower i thought i would have play d the part my father meant to act upon th usurper richard who being at salisbury made suit to come in s presence which if granted as he made semblance of his duty would have put his knife into him
now madam may his highness live in freedom and this man out of prison
there s something more would out of thee what say st
after the duke his father with the knife he stretch d him and with one hand on his dagger another spread on s breast mounting his eyes he did discharge a horrible oath whose tenour was were he evil us d he would outgo his father by as much as a performance does an irresolute purpose
there s his period to sheath his knife in us
he is attach d call him to present trial
if he may find mercy in the law tis his if none let him not seek t of us
he s traitor to th height
the palace enter the lord chamberlain and lord sandys chamberlain
is t possible the spells of france should juggle men into such strange mysteries
new customs though they be never so ridiculous nay let em be unmanly yet are follow d
as far as i see all the good our english have got by the late voyage is but merely a fit or two o th face but they are shrewd ones for when they hold em you would swear directly their very noses had been counsellors to pepin or clotharius they keep state so
they have all new legs and lame ones
one would take it that never saw em pace before the spavin or springhalt reign d among em
my lord their clothes are after such a pagan cut to t that sure th have worn out christendom
enter sir thomas lovell how now
faith my lord i hear of none but the new proclamation that s clapp d upon the court gate
the reformation of our travell d gallants that fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors
now i would pray our monsieurs to think an english courtier may be wise and never see the louvre
they must either for so run the conditions leave those remnants of fool and feather that they got in france with all their honourable points of ignorance pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks abusing better men than they can be out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean the faith they have in tennis and tall stockings short blist red breeches and those types of travel and understand again like honest men or pack to their old playfellows
there i take it they may cum privilegio wear away the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh d at
tis time to give em physic their diseases are grown so catching
what a loss our ladies will have of these trim vanities
ay marry there will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies
a french song and a fiddle has no fellow
i am glad they are going for sure there s no converting em
now an honest country lord as i am beaten a long time out of play may bring his plainsong and have an hour of hearing and by r lady held current music too
well said lord sandys your colt s tooth is not cast yet

th have left their barge and landed and hither make as great ambassadors from foreign princes
good lord chamberlain go give em welcome you can speak the french tongue and pray receive em nobly and conduct em into our presence where this heaven of beauty shall shine at full upon them
all rise and tables remov d you have now a broken banquet but we ll mend it
a good digestion to you all and once more i show r a welcome on ye welcome all
enter the king and others as maskers habited like shepherds usher d by the lord chamberlain
they pass directly before the cardinal and gracefully salute him a noble company
because they speak no english thus they pray d to tell your grace that having heard by fame of this so noble and so fair assembly this night to meet here they could do no less out of the great respect they bear to beauty but leave their flocks and under your fair conduct crave leave to view these ladies and entreat an hour of revels with em
say lord chamberlain they have done my poor house grace for which i pay em a thousand thanks and pray em take their pleasures
the king chooses anne bullen king
the fairest hand i ever touch d
o beauty till now i never knew thee
pray tell em thus much from me there should be one amongst em by his person more worthy this place than myself to whom if i but knew him with my love and duty i would surrender it
he whispers to the maskers wolsey
such a one they all confess there is indeed which they would have your grace find out and he will take it
comes from his state by all your good leaves gentlemen here i ll make my royal choice
unmasking ye have found him cardinal
you hold a fair assembly you do well lord
you are a churchman or i ll tell you cardinal i should judge now unhappily
i am glad your grace is grown so pleasant
my lord chamberlain prithee come hither what fair lady s that
an t please your grace sir thomas bullen s daughter the viscount rochford one of her highness women
by heaven she is a dainty one

lead in your ladies ev ry one
sweet partner i must not yet forsake you
let s be merry good my lord cardinal i have half a dozen healths to drink to these fair ladies and a measure to lead em once again and then let s dream who s best in favour
a street enter two gentlemen at several doors first gentleman
ev n to the hall to hear what shall become of the great duke of buckingham
i ll save you that labour sir
all s now done but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner
pray speak what has happen d
yes truly is he and condemn d upon t
but pray how pass d it
i ll tell you in a little
came to the bar where to his accusations he pleaded still not guilty and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law
the king s attorney on the contrary urg d on the examinations proofs confessions of divers witnesses which the duke desir d to have brought viva voce to his face at which appear d against him his surveyor sir gilbert peck his chancellor and john car confessor to him with that devil monk hopkins that made this mischief
that was he that fed him with his prophecies
all these accus d him strongly which he fain would have flung from him but indeed he could not and so his peers upon this evidence have found him guilty of high treason
much he spoke and learnedly for life but all was either pitied in him or forgotten
after all this how did he bear him self first gentleman
when he was brought again to th bar to hear his knell rung out his judgment he was stirr d with such an agony he sweat extremely and something spoke in choler ill and hasty but he fell to himself again and sweetly in all the rest show d a most noble patience
i do not think he fears death
sure he does not he never was so womanish the cause he may a little grieve at
certainly the cardinal is the end of this
tis likely by all conjectures first kildare s attainder then deputy of ireland who remov d earl surrey was sent thither and in haste too lest he should help his father
that trick of state was a deep envious one
at his return no doubt he will requite it
this is noted and generally whoever the king favours the cardinal instantly will find employment and far enough from court too
all the commons hate him perniciously and o my conscience wish him ten fathom deep this duke as much they love and dote on call him bounteous buckingham the mirror of all courtesy enter buckingham from his arraignment tip staves before him the axe with the edge towards him halberds on each side accompanied with sir thomas lovell sir nicholas vaux sir william sandys and common people etc
stay there sir and see the noble ruin d man you speak of
let s stand close and behold him
all good people you that thus far have come to pity me hear what i say and then go home and lose me
i have this day receiv d a traitor s judgment and by that name must die yet heaven bear witness and if i have a conscience let it sink me even as the axe falls if i be not faithful
the law i bear no malice for my death t has done upon the premises but justice
but those that sought it i could wish more christians
be what they will i heartily forgive em yet let em look they glory not in mischief nor build their evils on the graves of great men for then my guiltless blood must cry against em
for further life in this world i ne er hope nor will i sue although the king have mercies more than i dare make faults
you few that lov d me and dare be bold to weep for buckingham his noble friends and fellows whom to leave is only bitter to him only dying go with me like good angels to my end and as the long divorce of steel falls on me make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice and lift my soul to heaven
lead on a god s name
i do beseech your grace for charity if ever any malice in your heart were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
sir thomas lovell i as free forgive you as i would be forgiven
there cannot be those numberless offences gainst me that i cannot take peace with
no black envy shall mark my grave
commend me to his grace and if he speak of buckingham pray tell him you met him half in heaven
my vows and prayers yet are the king s and till my soul forsake shall cry for blessings on him
may he live longer than i have time to tell his years ever belov d and loving may his rule be and when old time shall lead him to his end goodness and he fill up one monument
to th water side i must conduct your grace then give my charge up to sir nicholas vaux who undertakes you to your end
prepare there the duke is coming see the barge be ready and fit it with such furniture as suits the greatness of his person
nay sir nicholas let it alone my state now will but mock me
when i came hither i was lord high constable and duke of buckingham now poor edward bohun
yet i am richer than my base accusers that never knew what truth meant i now seal it and with that blood will make em one day groan fort
my noble father henry of buckingham who first rais d head against usurping richard flying for succour to his servant banister being distress d was by that wretch betray d and without trial fell god s peace be with him
henry the seventh succeeding truly pitying my father s loss like a most royal prince restor d me to my honours and out of ruins made my name once more noble
now his son henry the eighth life honour name and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world
i had my trial and must needs say a noble one which makes me a little happier than my wretched father yet thus far we are one in fortunes both fell by our servants by those men we lov d most a most unnatural and faithless service
heaven has an end in all
yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you be not loose for those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye
all good people pray for me
i must now forsake ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me
farewell and when you would say something that is sad speak how i fell
i have done and god forgive me
exeunt buckingham and train first gentleman
o this is full of pity
sir it calls i fear too many curses on their heads that were the authors
if the duke be guiltless tis full of woe yet i can give you inkling of an ensuing evil if it fall greater than this
good angels keep it from us
you do not doubt my faith sir
this secret is so weighty twill require a strong faith to conceal it
let me have it i do not talk much
did you not of late days hear a buzzing of a separation between the king and katharine
yes but it held not for when the king once heard it out of anger he sent command to the lord mayor straight to stop the rumour and allay those tongues that durst disperse it
but that slander sir is found a truth now for it grows again fresher than e er it was and held for certain the king will venture at it
either the cardinal or some about him near have out of malice to the good queen possess d him with a scruple that will undo her
to confirm this too cardinal campeius is arriv d and lately as all think for this business
tis the cardinal and merely to revenge him on the emperor for not bestowing on him at his asking the archbishopric of toledo this is purpos d
i think you have hit the mark but is t not cruel that she should feel the smart of this
the cardinal will have his will and she must fall
we are too open here to argue this let s think in private more
the palace enter the lord chamberlain reading this letter chamberlain
my lord the horses your lordship sent for with all the care had i saw well chosen ridden and furnish d
they were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north
when they were ready to set out for london a man of my lord cardinal s by commission and main power took em from me with this reason his master would be serv d before a subject if not before the king which stopp d our mouths sir
he will have all i think
enter to the lord chamberlain the dukes of norfolk and suffolk norfolk
good day to both your graces
how is the king employ d
i left him private full of sad thoughts and troubles
it seems the marriage with his brother s wife has crept too near his conscience
no his conscience has crept too near another lady
tis so this is the cardinal s doing the king cardinal that blind priest like the eldest son of fortune turns what he list
the king will know him one day
he ll never know himself else
how holily he works in all his business
heaven keep me from such counsel
tis most true these news are everywhere every tongue speaks em and every true heart weeps for t
all that dare look into these affairs see this main end the french king s sister
heaven will one day open the king s eyes that so long have slept upon this bold bad man
and free us from his slavery
we had need pray and heartily for our deliverance or this imperious man will work us an from princes into pages
all men s honours lie like one lump before him to be fashion d into what pitch he please
for me my lords i love him not nor fear him there s my creed as i am made without him so i ll stand if the king please his curses and his blessings touch me alike th are breath i not believe in
i knew him and i know him so i leave him to him that made him proud the pope
let s in and with some other business put the king from these sad thoughts that work too much upon him
my lord you ll bear us company
excuse me the king has sent me otherwhere besides you ll find a most unfit time to disturb him
exit lord chamberlain and the king draws the curtain and sits reading pensively suffolk
how sad he looks sure he is much afflicted
pray god he be not angry
how dare you thrust yourselves into my private meditations
a gracious king that pardons all offences malice ne er meant
our breach of duty this way is business of estate in which we come to know your royal pleasure
go to i ll make ye know your times of business
is this an hour for temporal affairs ha
enter wolsey and campeius with a commission who s there
o my wolsey the quiet of my wounded conscience thou art a cure fit for a king
to campeius you re welcome most learned reverend sir into our kingdom
to wolsey my good lord have great care i be not found a talker
i would your grace would give us but an hour of private conference
to norfolk and suffolk we are busy go
aside to suffolk this priest has no pride in him
aside to norfolk not to speak of
i would not be so sick though for his place
aside to suffolk if it do i ll venture one have at him
your grace has given a precedent of wisdom above all princes in committing freely your scruple to the voice of christendom
the spaniard tied by blood and favour to her must now confess if they have any goodness the trial just and noble
all the clerks i mean the learned ones in christian kingdoms have their free voices
rome the nurse of judgment invited by your noble self hath sent one general tongue unto us this good man this just and learned priest cardinal campeius whom once more i present unto your highness
and once more in mine arms i bid him welcome and thank the holy conclave for their loves
they have sent me such a man i would have wish d for
your grace must needs deserve an strangers loves you are so noble
to your highness hand i tender my commission by whose virtue the court of rome commanding you my lord cardinal of york are join d with me their servant in the unpartial judging of this business
the queen shall be acquainted forthwith for what you come
i know your majesty has always lov d her so dear in heart not to deny her that a woman of less place might ask by law scholars allow d freely to argue for her
ay and the best she shall have and my favour to him that does best
cardinal prithee call gardiner to me my new secretary i find him a fit fellow
exit wolsey re enter wolsey with gardiner wolsey
aside to gardiner give me your hand much joy and favour to you you are the king s now
aside to wolsey but to be commanded for ever by your grace whose hand has rais d me
my lord of york was not one doctor pace in this man s place before him
was he not held a learned man
believe me there s an ill opinion spread then even of yourself lord cardinal
they will not stick to say you envied him and fearing he would rise he was so virtuous kept him a foreign man still which so griev d him that he ran mad and died
heav n s peace be with him
for living murmurers there s places of rebuke
he was a fool for he would needs be virtuous that good fellow if i command him follows my appointment
i will have none so near else
learn this brother we live not to be grip d by meaner persons
deliver this with modesty to th queen
exit gardiner the most convenient place that i can think of for such receipt of learning is blackfriars there ye shall meet about this weighty business my wolsey see it furnish d
o my lord would it not grieve an able man to leave so sweet a bedfellow
the palace enter anne bullen and an old lady anne
here s the pang that pinches his highness having liv d so long with her and she so good a lady that no tongue could ever pronounce dishonour of her by my life she never knew harm doing o now after so many courses of the sun enthroned still growing in a majesty and pomp the which to leave a thousand fold more bitter than tis sweet at first t acquire after this process to give her the avaunt it is a pity would move a monster
hearts of most hard temper melt and lament for her
much better she ne er had known pomp though t be temporal yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce it from the bearer tis a sufferance panging as soul and body s severing
she s a stranger now again
so much the more must pity drop upon her
verily i swear tis better to be lowly born and range with humble livers in content than to be perk d up in a glist ring grief and wear a golden sorrow
our content is our best having
by my troth and maidenhead i would not be a queen
beshrew me i would and venture maidenhead for t and so would you for all this spice of your hypocrisy
you that have so fair parts of woman on you have too a woman s heart which ever yet affected eminence wealth sovereignty which to say sooth are blessings and which gifts saving your mincing the capacity of your soft cheveril conscience would receive if you might please to stretch it
you would not be a queen
no not for all the riches under heaven
tis strange a threepence bow d would hire me old as i am to queen it
but i pray you what think you of a duchess
have you limbs to bear that load of title
pluck off a little i would not be a young count in your way for more than blushing comes to
if your back cannot vouchsafe this burden tis too weak ever to get a boy
i swear again i would not be a queen for all the world
in faith for little england you d venture an emballing
i myself would for carnarvonshire although there long d no more to th crown but that
what were t worth to know the secret of your conference
my good lord not your demand it values not your asking
our mistress sorrows we were pitying
it was a gentle business and becoming the action of good women there is hope all will be well
you bear a gentle mind and heav nly blessings follow such creatures
that you may fair lady perceive i speak sincerely and high notes ta en of your many virtues the king s majesty commends his good opinion of you to you and does purpose honour to you no less flowing than marchioness of pembroke to which tide a thousand pound a year annual support out of his grace he adds
i do not know what kind of my obedience i should tender more than my all is nothing nor my prayers are not words duly hallowed nor my wishes more worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes are all i can return
beseech your lordship vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience as from a blushing handmaid to his highness whose health and royalty i pray for
lady i shall not fail t approve the fair conceit the king hath of you
aside i have perus d her well beauty and honour in her are so mingled that they have caught the king and who knows yet but from this lady may proceed a gem to lighten all this isle i ll to the king and say i spoke with you
why this it is see see
i have been begging sixteen years in court am yet a courtier beggarly nor could come pat betwixt too early and too late for any suit of pounds and you o fate
a very fresh fish here fie fie fie upon this compell d fortune have your mouth fill d up before you open it
there was a lady once tis an old story that would not be a queen that would she not for all the mud in egypt
with your theme i could o ermount the lark
a thousand pounds a year for pure respect
by my life that promises moe thousands honour s train is longer than his foreskirt
by this time i know your back will bear a duchess
say are you not stronger than you were
good lady make yourself mirth with your particular fancy and leave me out on t
would i had no being if this salute my blood a jot it faints me to think what follows
the queen is comfortless and we forgetful in our long absence
pray do not deliver what here y have heard to her
a hall in blackfriars trumpets sennet and cornets
then enter the king and queen and their trains
the king takes place under the cloth of state the two cardinals sit under him as judges
the queen takes place some distance from the king
the bishops place themselves on each side of the court in manner of consistory below them the scribes
the lords sit next the bishops
the rest of the attendants stand in convenient order about the stage wolsey
whilst our commission from rome is read let silence be commanded
it hath already publicly been read and on all sides th authority allow d you may then spare that time
say henry king of england come into the court
henry king of england c king
say katharine queen of england come into the court
katharine queen of england c the queen makes no answer rises out of her chair goes about the court comes to the king and kneels at his feet then speaks queen katharine
sir i desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a most poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indifferent nor no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding
alas sir in what have i offended you
what cause hath my behaviour given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me of and take your good grace from me
heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclin d
when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too
or which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy
what friend of mine that had to him deriv d your anger did continue in my liking
nay gave notice he was from thence discharg d
sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blest with many children by you
if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honour aught my bond to wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in god s name turn me away and let the foul st contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the sharp st kind of justice
please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatch d wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckon d one the wisest prince that there had reign d by many a year before
it is not to be question d that they had gather d a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deem d our marriage lawful
wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advis d whose counsel i will implore
if not i th name of god your pleasure be fulfill d
you have here lady and of your choice these reverend fathers men of singular integrity and learning yea the elect o th land who are assembled to plead your cause
it shall be therefore bootless that longer you desire the court as well for your own quiet as to rectify what is unsettled in the king
his grace hath spoken well and justly therefore madam it s fit this royal session do proceed and that without delay their arguments be now produc d and heard
lord cardinal to you i speak
sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dream d so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears i ll turn to sparks of fire
i will when you are humble nay before or god will punish me
i do believe induc d by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy and make my challenge you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me which god s dew quench
therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth
i do profess you speak not like yourself who ever yet have stood to charity and display d th effects of disposition gentle and of wisdom o ertopping woman s pow r
madam you do me wrong i have no spleen against you nor injustice for you or any how far i have proceeded or how far further shall is warranted by a commission from the consistory yea the whole consistory of rome
you charge me that i have blown this coal i do deny it
the king is present if it be known to him that i gainsay my deed how may he wound and worthily my falsehood
yea as much as you have done my truth
if he know that i am free of your report he knows i am not of your wrong
therefore in him it lies to cure me and the cure is to remove these thoughts from you the which before his highness shall speak in i do beseech you gracious madam to unthink your speaking and to say so no more
my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak t oppose your cunning
y are meek and humble mouth d you sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is cramm d with arrogancy spleen and pride
you have by fortune and his highness favours gone slightly o er low steps and now are mounted where pow rs are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will as t please yourself pronounce their office
i must tell you you tender more your person s honour than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause fore his holiness and to be judg d by him
she curtsies to the king and offers to depart campeius
the queen is obstinate stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and disdainful to be tried by t tis not well
katharine queen of england come into the court
madam you are call d back
pray you keep your way when you are call d return
they vex me past my patience
i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts
exeunt queen and her attendants king
that man i th world who shall report he has a better wife let him in nought be trusted for speaking false in that
thou art alone if thy rare qualities sweet gentleness thy meekness saint like wife like government obeying in commanding and thy parts sovereign and pious else could speak thee out the queen of earthly queens
she s noble born and like her true nobility she has carried herself towards me
my lord cardinal i do excuse you yea upon mine honour i free you from t
you are not to be taught that you have many enemies that know not why they are so but like to village curs bark when their fellows do
by some of these the queen is put in anger
but will you be more justified
you ever have wish d the sleeping of this business never desir d it to be stirr d but oft have hind red oft the passages made toward it
on my honour i speak my good lord cardinal to this point and thus far clear him
now what mov d me to t i will be bold with time and your attention
thus it came give heed to t my conscience first receiv d a tenderness scruple and prick on certain speeches utter d by th bishop of bayonne then french ambassador who had been hither sent on the debating a marriage twixt the duke of orleans and our daughter mary
i th progress of this business ere a determinate resolution he i mean the bishop did require a respite wherein he might the king his lord advertise whether our daughter were legitimate respecting this our marriage with the dowager sometimes our brother s wife
this respite shook the bosom of my conscience enter d me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forc d such way that many maz d considerings did throng and press d in with this caution
first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady s womb if it conceiv d a male child by me should do no more offices of life to t than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had air d them
hence i took a thought this was a judgment on me that my kingdom well worthy the best heir o th world should not be gladded in t by me
then follows that i weigh d the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue s fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe
thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that s to say i meant to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn d
first i began in private with you my lord of lincoln you remember how under my oppression i did reek when i first mov d you
i have spoke long be pleas d yourself to say how far you satisfied me
so please your highness the question did at first so stagger me bearing a state of mighty moment in t and consequence of dread that i committed the daring st counsel which i had to doubt and did entreat your highness to this course which you are running here
i then mov d you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons
unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i th world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons drives this forward
prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our moral state to come with her katharine our queen before the primest creature that s paragon d o th world
so please your highness the queen being absent tis a needful fitness that we adjourn this court till further day meanwhile must be an earnest motion made to the queen to call back her appeal she intends unto his holiness
aside i may perceive these cardinals trifle with me
i abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome
my learn d and well beloved servant cranmer prithee return
with thy approach i know my comfort comes along
break up the court i say set on
exuent in manner as they entered act iii
the queen s apartments enter the queen and her women as at work queen katharine
my soul grows sad with troubles sing and disperse em if thou canst
song orpheus with his lute made trees and the mountain tops that freeze bow themselves when he did sing to his music plants and flowers ever sprung as sun and showers there had made a lasting spring
every thing that heard him play even the billows of the sea hung their heads and then lay by
in sweet music is such art killing care and grief of heart fall asleep or hearing die
an t please your grace the two great cardinals wait in the presence
they will d me say so madam
pray their graces to come near
exit gentleman what can be their business with me a poor weak woman fall n from favour
i do not like their coming
now i think on t they should be good men their affairs as righteous but all hoods make not monks
enter the two cardinals wolsey and campeius wolsey
your graces find me here part of housewife i would be all against the worst may happen
what are your pleasures with me reverend lords
may it please you noble madam to withdraw into your private chamber we shall give you the full cause of our coming
speak it here there s nothing i have done yet o my conscience deserves a corner
would all other women could speak this with as free a soul as i do
my lords i care not so much i am happy above a number if my actions were tried by ev ry tongue ev ry eye saw em envy and base opinion set against em i know my life so even
if your business seek me out and that way i am wife in out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina serenis sima queen katharine
o good my lord no latin
i am not such a truant since my coming as not to know the language i have liv d in a strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious pray speak in english
here are some will thank you if you speak truth for their poor mistress sake believe me she has had much wrong
lord cardinal the willing st sin i ever yet committed may be absolv d in english
noble lady i am sorry my integrity should breed and service to his majesty and you so deep suspicion where all faith was meant we come not by the way of accusation to taint that honour every good tongue blesses nor to betray you any way to sorrow you have too much good lady but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you and to deliver like free and honest men our just opinions and comforts to your cause
most honour d madam my lord of york out of his noble nature zeal and obedience he still bore your grace forgetting like a good man your late censure both of his truth and him which was too far offers as i do in a sign of peace his service and his counsel
aside to betray me my lords i thank you both for your good wins ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so
but how to make ye suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honour more near my life i fear with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not
i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business
for her sake that i have been for i feel the last fit of my greatness good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause
alas i am a woman friendless hopeless
madam you wrong the king s love with these fears your hopes and friends are infinite
in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any englishman dare give me counsel
or be a known friend gainst his highness pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject
nay forsooth my friends they that must weigh out my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my other comforts far hence in mine own country lords
i would your grace would leave your griefs and take my counsel
put your main cause into the king s protection he s loving and most gracious
twill be much both for your honour better and your cause for if the trial of the law o ertake ye you ll part away disgrac d
ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin
heaven is above all yet there sits a judge that no king can corrupt
the more shame for ye holy men i thought ye upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear ye
mend em for shame my lords
the cordial that ye bring a wretched lady a woman lost among ye laugh d at scorn d
i will not wish ye half my miseries i have more charity but say i warned ye
take heed for heaven s sake take heed lest at once the burden of my sorrows fall upon ye
madam this is a mere distraction you turn the good we offer into envy
woe upon ye and all such false professors
would you have me if you have any justice any pity if ye be any thing but churchmen s habits put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
has banish d me his bed already his love too long ago
i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience
what can happen to me above this wretchedness
all your studies make me a curse like this
have i liv d thus long let me speak myself since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one
a woman i dare say without vain glory never yet branded with suspicion
have i with all my full affections still met the king lov d him next heav n obey d him been out of fondness superstitious to him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded
bring me a constant woman to her husband one that ne er dream d a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honour a great patience
madam you wander from the good we aim at
my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall e er divorce my dignities
would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
what will become of me now wretched lady
i am the most unhappy woman living
to her women alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes
shipwreck d upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allow d me
like the my that once was mistress of the field and flourish d i ll hang my head and perish
if your grace could but be brought to know our ends are honest you d feel more comfort
why should we good lady upon what cause wrong you
alas our places the way of our profession is against it we are to cure such sorrows not to sow em
for goodness sake consider what you do how you may hurt yourself ay utterly grow from the king s acquaintance by this carriage
the hearts of princes kiss obedience so much they love it but to stubborn spirits they swell and grow as terrible as storms
i know you have a gentle noble temper a soul as even as a calm
pray think us those we profess peace makers friends and servants
madam you ll find it so
you wrong your virtues with these weak women s fears
a noble spirit as yours was put into you ever casts such doubts as false coin from it
the king loves you beware you lose it not
for us if you please to trust us in your business we are ready to use our utmost studies in your service
do what ye will my lords and pray forgive me if i have us d myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons
pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life
come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dear
the palace enter the duke of norfolk the duke of suffolk the earl of surrey and the lord chamberlain norfolk
if you will now unite in your complaints and force them with a constancy the cardinal cannot stand under them if you omit the offer of this time i cannot promise but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces with these you bear already
i am joyful to meet the least occasion that may give me remembrance of my father in law the duke to be reveng d on him
which of the peers have uncontemn d gone by him or at least strangely neglected
when did he regard the stamp of nobleness in any person out of himself
my lords you speak your pleasures
what he deserves of you and me i know what we can do to him though now the time gives way to us i much fear
if you cannot bar his access to th king never attempt anything on him for he hath a witchcraft over the king in s tongue
his spell in that is out the king hath found matter against him that for ever mars the honey of his language
no he s settled not to come off in his displeasure
sir i should be glad to hear such news as this once every hour
believe it this is true in the divorce his contrary proceedings are all unfolded wherein he appears as i would wish mine enemy
how came his practices to light
the cardinal s letters to the pope miscarried and came to th eye o th king wherein was read how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness to stay the judgment o th divorce for if it did take place i do quoth he perceive my king is tangled in affection to a creature of the queen s lady anne bullen
the king in this perceives him how he coasts and hedges his own way
but in this point all his tricks founder and he brings his physic after his patient s death the king already hath married the fair lady
may you be happy in your wish my lord
for i profess you have it
now all my joy trace the conjunction
there s order given for her coronation marry this is yet but young and may be left to some ears unrecounted
but my lords she is a gallant creature and complete in mind and feature
i persuade me from her will fall some blessing to this land which shall in it be memoriz d
but will the king digest this letter of the cardinal s
no no there be moe wasps that buzz about his nose will make this sting the sooner
cardinal campeius is stol n away to rome hath ta en no leave has left the cause o th king unhandled and is posted as the agent of our cardinal to second all his plot
i do assure you the king cried ha
now god incense him and let him cry ha
but my lord when returns cranmer
he is return d in his opinions which have satisfied the king for his divorce together with all famous colleges almost in christendom
shortly i believe his second marriage shall be publish d and her coronation
katharine no more shall be call d queen but princess dowager and widow to prince arthur
this same cranmer s a worthy fellow and hath ta en much pain in the king s business
he has and we shall see him for it an archbishop
enter wolsey and cromwell the cardinal
the packet cromwell gave t you the king
to his own hand in s bedchamber
look d he o th inside of the paper
presently he did unseal them and the first he view d he did it with a serious mind a heed was in his countenance
you he bade attend him here this morning
is he ready to come abroad
i think by this he is
exit cromwell aside it shall be to the duchess of alencon the french king s sister he shall marry her
no i ll no anne bullens for him there s more in t than fair visage
speedily i wish to hear from rome
may be he hears the king does whet his anger to him
sharp enough lord for thy justice
aside the late queen s gentlewoman a knight s daughter to be her mistress mistress
tis i must snuff it then out it goes
what though i know her virtuous and well deserving
yet i know her for a spleeny lutheran and not wholesome to our cause that she should lie i th bosom of our hard rul d king
again there is sprung up an heretic an arch one cranmer one hath crawl d into the favour of the king and is his oracle
he is vex d at something
enter the king reading of a schedule and lovell surrey
i would twere something that would fret the string the master cord on s heart
what piles of wealth hath he accumulated to his own portion
and what expense by th hour seems to flow from him
how i th name of thrift does he rake this together now my lords saw you the cardinal
my lord we have stood here observing him
some strange commotion is in his brain he bites his lip and starts stops on a sudden looks upon the ground then lays his finger on his temple straight springs out into fast gait then stops again strikes his breast hard and anon he casts his eye against the moon
in most strange postures we have seen him set himself
it may well be there is a mutiny in s mind
this morning papers of state he sent me to peruse as i requir d and wot you what i found there on my conscience put unwittingly
forsooth an inventory thus importing the several parcels of his plate his treasure rich stuffs and ornaments of household which i find at such proud rate that it outspeaks possession of a subject
it s heaven s will some spirit put this paper in the packet to bless your eye withal
if we did think his contemplation were above the earth and fix d on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but i am afraid his thinkings are below the moon not worth his serious considering
the king takes his seat and whispers lovell who goes to the cardinal wolsey
good my lord you are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory of your best graces in your mind the which you were now running o er
you have scarce time to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span to keep your earthly audit sure in that i deem you an ill husband and am glad to have you therein my companion
sir for holy offices i have a time a time to think upon the part of business which i bear i th state and nature does require her times of preservation which perforce i her frail son amongst my brethren mortal must give my tendance to
and ever may your highness yoke together as i will lend you cause my doing well with my well saying
tis well said again and tis a kind of good deed to say well and yet words are no deeds
my father lov d you he said he did and with his deed did crown his word upon you
since i had my office i have kept you next my heart have not alone employ d you where high profits might come home but par d my present havings to bestow my bounties upon you
aside the lord increase this business
have i not made you the prime man of the state
i pray you tell me if what i now pronounce you have found true and if you may confess it say withal if you are bound to us or no
my sovereign i confess your royal graces show r d on me daily have been more than could my studied purposes requite which went beyond all man s endeavours
my endeavours have ever come too short of my desires yet fil d with my abilities mine own ends have been mine so that evermore they pointed to th good of your most sacred person and the profit of the state
for your great graces heap d upon me poor undeserver i can nothing render but allegiant thanks my pray rs to heaven for you my loyalty which ever has and ever shall be growing till death that winter kill it
a loyal and obedient subject is therein illustrated the honour of it does pay the act of it as i th contrary the foulness is the punishment
i presume that as my hand has open d bounty to you my heart dropp d love my pow r rain d honour more on you than any so your hand and heart your brain and every function of your power should notwithstanding that your bond of duty as twere in love s particular be more to me your friend than any
i do profess that for your highness good i ever labour d more than mine own that am have and will be though all the world should crack their duty to you and throw it from their soul though perils did abound as thick as thought could make em and appear in forms more horrid yet my duty as doth a rock against the chiding flood should the approach of this wild river break and stand unshaken yours
take notice lords he has a loyal breast for you have seen him open t
read o er this giving him papers and after this and then to breakfast with what appetite you have
exit the king frowning upon the cardinal the nobles throng after him smiling and whispering wolsey
how have i reap d it
he parted frowning from me as if ruin leap d from his eyes so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman that has gall d him then makes him nothing
i must read this paper i fear the story of his anger
tis so this paper has undone me
tis th account of all that world of wealth i have drawn together for mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom and fee my friends in rome
o negligence fit for a fool to fall by
what cross devil made me put this main secret in the packet i sent the king
is there no way to cure this
no new device to beat this from his brains
i know twill stir him strongly yet i know a way if it take right in spite of fortune will bring me off again
the letter as i live with all the business i writ to s holiness
i have touch d the highest point of all my greatness and from that full meridian of my glory i haste now to my setting
i shall fall like a bright exhalation in the evening and no man see me more
re enter to wolsey the dukes of norfolk and suffolk the earl of surrey and the lord chamberlain norfolk
hear the king s pleasure cardinal who commands you to render up the great seal presently into our hands and to confine yourself to asher house my lord of winchester s till you hear further from his highness
stay where s your commission lords
words cannot carry authority so weighty
who dares cross em bearing the king s will from his mouth expressly
till i find more than will or words to do it i mean your malice know officious lords i dare and must deny it
now i feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy how eagerly ye follow my disgraces as if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
follow your envious courses men of malice you have christian warrant for em and no doubt in time will find their fit rewards
that seal you ask with such a violence the king mine and your master with his own hand gave me bade me enjoy it with the place and honours during my life and to confirm his goodness tied it by letters patents
thou art a proud traitor priest
within these forty hours surrey durst better have burnt that tongue than said so
thy ambition thou scarlet sin robb d this bewailing land of noble buckingham my father in law
the heads of all thy brother cardinals with thee and all thy best parts bound together weigh d not a hair of his
you sent me deputy for ireland far from his succour from the king from all that might have mercy on the fault thou gav st him whilst your great goodness out of holy pity absolv d him with an axe
this and all else this talking lord can lay upon my credit i answer is most false
the duke by law found his deserts how innocent i was from any private malice in his end his noble jury and foul cause can witness
if i lov d many words lord i should tell you you have as little honesty as honour that in the way of loyalty and truth toward the king my ever royal master dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be and an that love his follies
by my soul your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel my sword i the life blood of thee else
my lords can ye endure to hear this arrogance
if we live thus tamely to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet farewell nobility
let his grace go forward and dare us with his cap like larks
all goodness is poison to thy stomach
yes that goodness of gleaning all the land s wealth into one into your own hands cardinal by extortion the goodness of your intercepted packets you writ to th pope against the king your goodness since you provoke me shall be most notorious
my lord of norfolk as you are truly noble as you respect the common good the state of our despis d nobility our issues whom if he live will scarce be gentlemen produce the grand sum of his sins the articles collected from his life
i ll startle you worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms lord cardinal
how much methinks i could despise this man but that i am bound in charity against it
those articles my lord are in the king s hand but thus much they are foul ones
so much fairer and spotless shall mine innocence arise when the king knows my truth
i thank my memory i yet remember some of these articles and out they shall
now if you can blush and cry guilty cardinal you ll show a little honesty
speak on sir i dare your worst objections
if i blush it is to see a nobleman want manners
i had rather want those than my head
first that without the king s assent or knowledge you wrought to be a legate by which power you maim d the jurisdiction of all bishops
then that in all you writ to rome or else to foreign princes ego et rex meus was still inscrib d in which you brought the king to be your servant
then that without the knowledge either of king or council when you went ambassador to the emperor you made bold to carry into flanders the great seal
item you sent a large commission to gregory de cassado to conclude without the king s will or the state s allowance a league between his highness and ferrara
that out of mere ambition you have caus d your holy hat to be stamp d on the king s coin
then that you have sent innumerable substance by what means got i leave to your own conscience to furnish rome and to prepare the ways you have for dignities to the mere undoing of all the kingdom
many more there are which since they are of you and odious i will not taint my mouth with
o my lord press not a falling man too far
his faults lie open to the laws let them not you correct him
my heart weeps to see him so little of his great self
lord cardinal the king s further pleasure is because all those things you have done of late by your power legatine within this kingdom fall into th compass of a praemunire that therefore such a writ be sued against you to forfeit all your goods lands tenements chattels and whatsoever and to be out of the king s protection
and so we ll leave you to your meditations how to live better
for your stubborn answer about the giving back the great seal to us the king shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
so fare you well my little good lord cardinal
so farewell to the little good you bear me
farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
this is the state of man to day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes to morrow blossoms and bears his blushing honours thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do
i have ventur d like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth
my high blown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye i feel my heart new open d
o how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
there is betwixt that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and their ruin more pangs and fears than wars or women have and when he falls he falls like lucifer never to hope again
enter cromwell standing amazed why how now cromwell
i have no power to speak sir
what amaz d at my misfortunes
can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline
nay an you weep i am fall n indeed
why well never so truly happy my good cromwell
i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience
the king has cur d me i humbly thank his grace and from these shoulders these ruin d pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honour
o tis a burden cromwell tis a burden too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
i am glad your grace has made that right use of it
i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weak hearted enemies dare offer
the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king
the next is that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place
but he s a learned man
may he continue long in his highness favour and do justice for truth s sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on him
that cranmer is return d with welcome install d lord archbishop of canterbury
last that the lady anne whom the king hath in secrecy long married this day was view d in open as his queen going to chapel and the voice is now only about her coronation
there was the weight that pull d me down
o cromwell the king has gone beyond me
all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever
no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles
go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fall n man unworthy now to be thy lord and master
seek the king that sun i pray may never set
i have told him what and how true thou art
he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too
good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety
o my lord must i then leave you
must i needs forgo so good so noble and so true a master
bear witness all that have not hearts of iron with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord
the king shall have my service but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours
cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou hast forc d me out of thy honest truth to play the woman
let s dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me more must be heard of say i taught thee say wolsey that once trod the ways of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master miss d it
mark but my fall and that that ruin d me
cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels
how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it
love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee corruption wins not more than honesty
still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues
be just and fear not let all the ends thou aim st at be thy country s thy god s and truth s then if thou fall st o cromwell thou fall st a blessed martyr
serve the king and prithee lead me in
there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny tis the king s
my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call mine own
had i but serv d my god with half the zeal i serv d my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies
my hopes in heaven do dwell
a street in westminster enter two gentlemen meeting one another first gentleman
y are well met once again
you come to take your stand here and behold the lady anne pass from her coronation
at our last encounter the duke of buckingham came from his trial
but that time offer d sorrow this general joy
the citizens i am sure have shown at full their royal minds as let em have their rights they are ever forward in celebration of this day with shows pageants and sights of honour
never greater nor i ll assure you better taken sir
may i be bold to ask what that contains that paper in your hand
yes tis the list of those that claim their offices this day by custom of the coronation
the duke of suffolk is the first and claims to be high steward next the duke of norfolk he to be earl marshal
i thank you sir had i not known those customs i should have been beholding to your paper
but i beseech you what s become of katharine the princess dowager
that i can tell you too
the archbishop of canterbury accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers of his order held a late court at dunstable six miles of from ampthill where the princess lay to which she was often cited by them but appear d not
and to be short for not appearance and the king s late scruple by the main assent of all these learned men she was divorc d and the late marriage made of none effect since which she was removed to kimbolton where she remains now sick

sir as i have a soul she is an angel our king has all the indies in his arms and more and richer when he strains that lady i cannot blame his conscience
they that bear the cloth of honour over her are four barons of the cinque ports
those men are happy and so are all are near her
i take it she that carries up the train is that old noble lady duchess of norfolk
it is and all the rest are countesses
these are stars indeed and sometimes falling ones
exit procession with a great flourish of trumpets enter a third gentleman god save you sir
among the crowds i th abbey where a finger could not be wedg d in more i am stifled with the mere rankness of their joy

as well as i am able
the rich stream of lords and ladies having brought the queen to a prepar d place in the choir fell of a distance from her while her grace sat down to rest awhile some half an hour or so in a rich chair of state opposing freely the beauty of her person to the people
believe me sir she is the goodliest woman that ever lay by man which when the people had the full view of such a noise arose as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest as loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks doublets i think flew up and had their faces been loose this day they had been lost
such joy i never saw before
great bellied women that had not half a week to go like rams in the old time of war would shake the press and make em reel before em
no man living could say this is my wife there all were woven so strangely in one piece
at length her grace rose and with modest paces came to the altar where she kneel d and saintlike cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray d devoutly
then rose again and bow d her to the people when by the archbishop of canterbury she had all the royal makings of a queen as holy oil edward confessor s crown the rod and bird of peace and all such emblems laid nobly on her which perform d the choir with all the choicest music of the kingdom together sung te deum
so she parted and with the same full state pac d back again to york place where the feast is held
sir you must no more call it york place that s past for since the cardinal fell that title s lost
tis now the king s and called whitehall
i know it but tis so lately alter d that the old name is fresh about me
what two reverend bishops were those that went on each side of the queen
stokesly and gardiner the one of winchester newly preferr d from the king s secretary the other london
he of winchester is held no great good lover of the archbishop s the virtuous cranmer
all the land knows that however yet there is no great breach
when it comes cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him
who may that be i pray you
thomas cromwell a man in much esteem with th king and truly a worthy friend
the king has made him master o th jewel house and one already of the privy council
come gentlemen ye shall go my way which is to th court and there ye shall be my guests something i can command
as i walk thither i ll tell ye more
kimbolton enter katharine dowager sick led between griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman griffith
my legs like loaden branches bow to th earth willing to leave their burden
so now methinks i feel a little ease
didst thou not tell me griffith as thou led st me that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead
yes madam but i think your grace out of the pain you suffer d gave no ear to t
prithee good griffith tell me how he died
if well he stepp d before me happily for my example
well the voice goes madam for after the stout earl northumberland arrested him at york and brought him forward as a man sorely tainted to his answer he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill he could not sit his mule
at last with easy roads he came to leicester lodg d in the abbey where the reverend abbot with all his covent honourably receiv d him to whom he gave these words o father abbot an old man broken with the storms of state is come to lay his weary bones among ye give him a little earth for charity
so went to bed where eagerly his sickness pursu d him still and three nights after this about the hour of eight which he himself foretold should be his last full of repentance continual meditations tears and sorrows he gave his honours to the world again his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
so may he rest his faults lie gently on him
yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity
he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom
simony was fair play his own opinion was his law
i th presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning
he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful
his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing
of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example
noble madam men s evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water
may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now
yes good griffith i were malicious else
this cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashion d to much honour from his cradle
he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wise fair spoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that lov d him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer
and though he were unsatisfied in getting which was a sin yet in bestowing madam he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he rais d in you ipswich and oxford
one of which fell with him unwilling to outlive the good that did it the other though unfinish d yet so famous so excellent in art and still so rising that christendom shall ever speak his virtue
his overthrow heap d happiness upon him for then and not till then he felt himself and found the blessedness of being little
and to add greater honours to his age than man could give him he died fearing god
after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honour from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith
whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honour
patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee
good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i nam d my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to
good wench let s sit down quiet for fear we wake her
enter solemnly tripping one after another six personages clad in white robes wearing on their heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their faces branches of bays or palm in their hands
they first congee unto her then dance and at certain changes the first two hold a spare garland over her head at which the other four make reverent curtsies
then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two who observe the same order in their changes and holding the garland over her head which done they deliver the same garland to the last two who likewise observe the same order at which as it were by inspiration she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her hands to heaven
and so in their dancing vanish carrying the garland with them
spirits of peace where are ye
and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye
it is not you i call for
saw ye none enter since i slept
saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
they promis d me eternal happiness and brought me garlands griffith which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear
i am most joyful madam such good dreams possess your fancy
bid the music leave they are harsh and heavy to me
do you note how much her grace is alter d on the sudden
how long her face is drawn
how pale she looks and of an earthly cold
an t like your grace katharine
you are to blame knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness to use so rude behaviour
i humbly do entreat your highness pardon my haste made me unmannerly
there is staying a gentleman sent from the king to see you
admit him entrance griffith but this fellow let me ne er see again
exit messenger enter lord capucius if my sight fail not you should be lord ambassador from the emperor my royal nephew and your name capucius
o my lord the times and titles now are alter d strangely with me since first you knew me
but i pray you what is your pleasure with me
noble lady first mine own service to your grace the next the king s request that i would visit you who grieves much for your weakness and by me sends you his princely commendations and heartily entreats you take good comfort
o my good lord that comfort comes too late tis like a pardon after execution that gentle physic given in time had cur d me but now i am past all comforts here but prayers
and ever flourish when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name banish d the kingdom
patience is that letter i caus d you write yet sent away
sir i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king
in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves his young daughter the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding she is young and of a noble modest nature i hope she will deserve well and a little to love her for her mother s sake that lov d him heaven knows how dearly
my next poor petition is that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women that so long have follow d both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one i dare avow and now i should not lie but will deserve for virtue and true beauty of the soul for honesty and decent carriage a right good husband let him be a noble and sure those men are happy that shall have em
the last is for my men they are the poorest but poverty could never draw em from me that they may have their wages duly paid em and something over to remember me by
if heaven had pleas d to have given me longer life and able means we had not parted thus
these are the whole contents and good my lord by that you love the dearest in this world as you wish christian peace to souls departed stand these poor people s friend and urge the king to do me this last right
by heaven i will or let me lose the fashion of a man
remember me in all humility unto his highness say his long trouble now is passing out of this world
tell him in death i bless d him for so i will
nay patience you must not leave me yet
i must to bed call in more women
when i am dead good wench let me be us d with honour strew me over with maiden flowers that all the world may know i was a chaste wife to my grave
embalm me then lay me forth although unqueen d yet like a queen and daughter to a king inter me

ah my good lord i grieve at what i speak and am right sorry to repeat what follows
i have and most unwillingly of late heard many grievous i do say my lord grievous complaints of you which being consider d have mov d us and our council that you shall this morning come before us where i know you cannot with such freedom purge yourself but that till further trial in those charges which will require your answer you must take your patience to you and be well contented to make your house our tow r
you a brother of us it fits we thus proceed or else no witness would come against you
i humbly thank your highness and am right glad to catch this good occasion most throughly to be winnowed where my chaff and corn shall fly asunder for i know there s none stands under more calumnious tongues than i myself poor man
stand up good canterbury thy truth and thy integrity is rooted in us thy friend
give me thy hand stand up prithee let s walk
now by my holidame what manner of man are you
my lord i look d you would have given me your petition that i should have ta en some pains to bring together yourself and your accusers and to have heard you without indurance further
most dread liege the good i stand on is my truth and honesty if they shall fail i with mine enemies will triumph o er my person which i weigh not being of those virtues vacant
i fear nothing what can be said against me
know you not how your state stands i th world with the whole world
your enemies are many and not small their practices must bear the same proportion and not ever the justice and the truth o th question carries the due o th verdict with it at what ease might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt to swear against you
you are potently oppos d and with a malice of as great size
ween you of better luck i mean in perjur d witness than your master whose minister you are whiles here he liv d upon this naughty earth
go to go to you take a precipice for no leap of danger and woo your own destruction
god and your majesty protect mine innocence or i fall into the trap is laid for me
be of good cheer they shall no more prevail than we give way to
keep comfort to you and this morning see you do appear before them if they shall chance in charging you with matters to commit you the best persuasions to the contrary fail not to use and with what vehemency th occasion shall instruct you

exit cranmer he has strangled his language in his tears
within come back what mean you
i ll not come back the tidings that i bring will make my boldness manners
now good angels fly o er thy royal head and shade thy person under their blessed wings
now by thy looks i guess thy message
say ay and of a boy
ay ay my liege and of a lovely boy
the god of heaven both now and ever bless her
tis a girl promises boys hereafter
sir your queen desires your visitation and to be acquainted with this stranger tis as like you as cherry is to cherry
by this light i ll ha more
an ordinary groom is for such payment
i will have more or scold it out of him
said i for this the girl was like to him
i ll have more or else unsay t and now while tis hot i ll put it to the issue
lobby before the council chamber enter cranmer archbishop of canterbury cranmer
i hope i am not too late and yet the gentleman that was sent to me from the council pray d me to make great haste
yes my lord but yet i cannot help you
your grace must wait till you be call d for
aside this is a piece of malice
i am glad i came this way so happily the king shall understand it presently
aside tis butts the king s physician as he pass d along how earnestly he cast his eyes upon me
pray heaven he sound not my disgrace
for certain this is of purpose laid by some that hate me god turn their hearts
i never sought their malice to quench mine honour they would shame to make me wait else at door a fellow councillor mong boys grooms and lackeys
but their pleasures must be fulfill d and i attend with patience
enter the king and butts at window above butts
i ll show your grace the strangest sight king
i think your highness saw this many a day
body a me where is it
there my lord the high promotion of his grace of canterbury who holds his state at door mongst pursuivants pages and footboys
is this the honour they do one another
tis well there s one above em yet
i had thought they had parted so much honesty among em at least good manners as not thus to suffer a man of his place and so near our favour to dance attendance on their lordships pleasures and at the door too like a post with packets
by holy mary butts there s knavery
let em alone and draw the curtain close we shall hear more anon
the council chamber a council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed under the state
enter lord chancellor places himself at the upper end of the table on the left band a seat being left void above him as for canterbury s seat
duke of suffolk duke of norfolk surrey lord chamberlain gardiner seat themselves in order on each side cromwell at lower end as secretary
speak to the business master secretary why are we met in council
please your honours the chief cause concerns his grace of canterbury
has he had knowledge of it
my lord archbishop and has done half an hour to know your pleasures
cranmer approaches the council table chancellor
which reformation must be sudden too my noble lords for those that tame wild horses pace em not in their hands to make em gentle but stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur em till they obey the manage
if we suffer out of our easiness and childish pity to one man s honour this contagious sickness farewell all physic and what follows then
commotions uproars with a general taint of the whole state as of late days our neighbours the upper germany can dearly witness yet freshly pitied in our memories
my good lords hitherto in all the progress both of my life and office i have labour d and with no little study that my teaching and the strong course of my authority might go one way and safely and the end was ever to do well
nor is there living i speak it with a single heart my lords a man that more detests more stirs against both in his private conscience and his place defacers of a public peace than i do
pray heaven the king may never find a heart with less allegiance in it
men that make envy and crooked malice nourishment dare bite the best
i do beseech your lordships that in this case of justice my accusers be what they will may stand forth face to face and freely urge against me
nay my lord that cannot be you are a councillor and by that virtue no man dare accuse you
my lord because we have business of more moment we will be short with you
tis his highness pleasure and our consent for better trial of you from hence you be committed to the tower where being but a private man again you shall know many dare accuse you boldly more than i fear you are provided for
ah my good lord of winchester i thank you you are always my good friend if your will pass i shall both find your lordship judge and juror you are so merciful
i see your end tis my undoing
love and meekness lord become a churchman better than ambition win straying souls with modesty again cast none away
that i shall clear myself lay all the weight ye can upon my patience i make as little doubt as you do conscience in doing daily wrongs
i could say more but reverence to your calling makes me modest
my lord my lord you are a sectary that s the plain truth
your painted gloss discovers to men that understand you words and weakness
my lord of winchester y are a little by your good favour too sharp men so noble however faulty yet should find respect for what they have been tis a cruelty to load a falling man
good master secretary i cry your honour mercy you may worst of all this table say so
do not i know you for a favourer of this new sect
would you were half so honest
men s prayers then would seek you not their fears
i shall remember this bold language
this is too much forbear for shame my lords
then thus for you my lord it stands agreed i take it by all voices that forthwith you be convey d to th tower a prisoner there to remain till the king s further pleasure be known unto us
is there no other way of mercy but i must needs to th tower my lords
let some o th guard be ready there
must i go like a traitor thither
receive him and see him safe i th tower
stay good my lords i have a little yet to say
look there my lords by virtue of that ring i take my cause out of the gripes of cruel men and give it to a most noble judge the king my master
this is the king s ring
tis the right ring by heav n
i told ye all when we first put this dangerous stone a rolling twould fall upon ourselves
do you think my lords the king will suffer but the little finger of this man to be vex d
tis now too certain how much more is his life in value with him
would i were fairly out on t
my mind gave me in seeking tales and informations against this man whose honesty the devil and his disciples only envy at ye blew the fire that burns ye
enter the king frowning on them he takes his seat gardiner
dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven in daily thanks that gave us such a prince not only good and wise but most religious one that in all obedience makes the church the chief aim of his honour and to strengthen that holy duty out of dear respect his royal self in judgment comes to hear the cause betwixt her and this great offender
you were ever good at sudden commendations bishop of winchester
but know i come not to hear such flattery now and in my presence they are too thin and bare to hide offences
to me you cannot reach you play the spaniel and think with wagging of your tongue to win me but whatsoe er thou tak st me for i m sure thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
to cranmer good man sit down
now let me see the proudest he that dares most but wag his finger at thee
by all that s holy he had better starve than but once think this place becomes thee not
may it please your grace king
no sir it does not please me
i had thought i had had men of some understanding and wisdom of my council but i find none
was it discretion lords to let this man this good man few of you deserve that title this honest man wait like a lousy footboy at chamber door
and one as great as you are
why what a shame was this
did my commission bid ye so far forget yourselves
i gave ye power as he was a councillor to try him not as a groom
there s some of ye i see more out of malice than integrity would try him to the utmost had ye mean which ye shall never have while i live
thus far my most dread sovereign may it like your grace to let my tongue excuse all
what was purpos d concerning his imprisonment was rather if there be faith in men meant for his trial and fair purgation to the world than malice i m sure in me
well well my lords respect him take him and use him well he s worthy of it
i will say thus much for him if a prince may be beholding to a subject am for his love and service so to him
make me no more ado but all embrace him be friends for shame my lords
my lord of canterbury i have a suit which you must not deny me that is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism you must be godfather and answer for her
the greatest monarch now alive may glory in such an honour how may i deserve it that am a poor and humble subject to you
come come my lord you d spare your spoons
you shall have two noble partners with you the old duchess of norfolk and lady marquis dorset
once more my lord of winchester i charge you embrace and love this man
with a true heart and brother love i do it
and let heaven witness how dear i hold this confirmation
good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
the common voice i see is verified of thee which says thus do my lord of canterbury a shrewd turn and he s your friend for ever
come lords we trifle time away i long to have this young one made a christian
as i have made ye one lords one remain so i grow stronger you more honour gain
the palace yard noise and tumult within
enter porter and his man porter

as much as one sound cudgel of four foot you see the poor remainder could distribute i made no spare sir
i am not samson nor sir guy nor colbrand to mow em down before me but if i spar d any that had a head to hit either young or old he or she cuckold or cuckold maker let me ne er hope to see a chine again and that i would not for a cow god save her
within do you hear master porter
i shall be with you presently good master puppy
what would you have me do
what should you do but knock em down by th dozens
is this moorfields to muster in
or have we some strange indian with the great tool come to court the women so besiege us
bless me what a fry of fornication is at door
on my christian conscience this one christening will beget a thousand here will be father godfather and all together
the spoons will be the bigger sir
there is a fellow somewhat near the door he should be a brazier by his face for o my conscience twenty of the dog days now reign in s nose all that stand about him are under the line they need no other penance
that fire drake did i hit three times on the head and three times was his nose discharged against me he stands there like a mortar piece to blow us
there was a haberdasher s wife of small wit near him that rail d upon me till her pink d porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in the state
i miss d the meteor once and hit that woman who cried out clubs
when i might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour which were the hope o th strand where she was quartered
they fell on i made good my place
at length they came to th broomstaff to me i defied em still when suddenly a file of boys behind em loose shot deliver d such a show r of pebbles that i was fain to draw mine honour in and let em win the work the devil was amongst em i think surely
these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples that no audience but the tribulation of tower hill or the limbs of limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure
i have some of em in limbo patrum and there they are like to dance these three days besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come
mercy o me what a multitude are here
they grow still too from all parts they are coming as if we kept a fair here
where are these porters these lazy knaves
y have made a fine hand fellows
there s a trim rabble let in are all these your faithful friends o th suburbs
we shall have great store of room no doubt left for the ladies when they pass back from the christening
an t please your honour we are but men and what so many may do not being torn a pieces we have done
as i live if the king blame me for t i ll lay ye an by th heels and suddenly and on your heads clap round fines for neglect
y are lazy knaves and here ye lie baiting of bombards when ye should do service
the trumpets sound th are come already from the christening
go break among the press and find a way out to let the troops pass fairly or i ll find a marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months
make way there for the princess
you great fellow stand close up or i ll make your head ache

let me speak sir for heaven now bids me and the words i utter let none think flattery for they ll find em truth
this royal infant heaven still move about her though in her cradle yet now promises upon this land a thousand blessings which time shall bring to ripeness
she shall be but few now living can behold that goodness a pattern to all princes living with her and all that shall succeed
saba was never more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue than this pure soul shall be
all princely graces that mould up such a mighty piece as this is with all the virtues that attend the good shall still be doubled on her
truth shall nurse her holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her she shall be lov d and fear d
her own shall bless her her foes shake like a field of beaten corn and hang their heads with sorrow
good grows with her in her days every man shall eat in safety under his own vine what he plants and sing the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours
god shall be truly known and those about her from her shall read the perfect ways of honour and by those claim their greatness not by blood
nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when the bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix her ashes new create another heir as great in admiration as herself so shall she leave her blessedness to one when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness who from the sacred ashes of her honour shall star like rise as great in fame as she was and so stand fix d
peace plenty love truth terror that were the servants to this chosen infant shall then be his and like a vine grow to him wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine his honour and the greatness of his name shall be and make new nations he shall flourish and like a mountain cedar reach his branches to all the plains about him our children s children shall see this and bless heaven
she shall be to the happiness of england an aged princess many days shall see her and yet no day without a deed to crown it
would i had known no more
but she must die she must the saints must have her yet a virgin a most unspotted lily shall she pass to th ground and all the world shall mourn her
o lord archbishop thou hast made me now a man never before this happy child did i get anything
this oracle of comfort has so pleas d me that when i am in heaven i shall desire to see what this child does and praise my maker
to you my good lord mayor and you good brethren i am much beholding i have receiv d much honour by your presence and ye shall find me thankful
lead the way lords ye must all see the queen and she must thank ye she will be sick else
this day no man think has business at his house for all shall stay
this little one shall make it holiday

scene 1 king john s palace enter king john queen elinor pembroke essex salisbury and others with chatillon king john
now say chatillon what would france with us
thus after greeting speaks the king of france in my behaviour to the majesty the borrowed majesty of england here
silence good mother hear the embassy
philip of france in right and true behalf of thy deceased brother geffrey s son arthur plantagenet lays most lawful claim to this fair island and the territories to ireland poictiers anjou touraine maine desiring thee to lay aside the sword which sways usurpingly these several titles and put the same into young arthur s hand thy nephew and right royal sovereign
what follows if we disallow of this
the proud control of fierce and bloody war to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld
here have we war for war and blood for blood controlment for controlment so answer france
then take my king s defiance from my mouth the farthest limit of my embassy
bear mine to him and so depart in peace be thou as lightning in the eyes of france for ere thou canst report i will be there the thunder of my cannon shall be heard
be thou the trumpet of our wrath and sullen presage of your own decay
an honourable conduct let him have pembroke look to t
have i not ever said how that ambitious constance would not cease till she had kindled france and all the world upon the right and party of her son
this might have been prevented and made whole with very easy arguments of love which now the manage of two kingdoms must with fearful bloody issue arbitrate
our strong possession and our right for us
your strong possession much more than your right or else it must go wrong with you and me so much my conscience whispers in your ear which none but heaven and you and i shall hear
my liege here is the strangest controversy come from the country to be judg d by you that e er i heard
exit sheriff our abbeys and our priories shall pay this expedition s charge
enter robert faulconbridge and philip his bastard brother what men are you
your faithful subject i a gentleman born in northamptonshire and eldest son as i suppose to robert faulconbridge a soldier by the honour giving hand of coeur de lion knighted in the field
the son and heir to that same faulconbridge
is that the elder and art thou the heir
you came not of one mother then it seems
most certain of one mother mighty king that is well known and as i think one father but for the certain knowledge of that truth i put you o er to heaven and to my mother
of that i doubt as all men s children may
thou dost shame thy mother and wound her honour with this diffidence
no i have no reason for it that is my brother s plea and none of mine the which if he can prove a pops me out at least from fair five hundred pound a year
heaven guard my mother s honour and my land
why being younger born doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
i know not why except to get the land
but once he slander d me with bastardy but whe er i be as true begot or no that still i lay upon my mother s head but that i am as well begot my liege fair fall the bones that took the pains for me compare our faces and be judge yourself
if old sir robert did beget us both and were our father and this son like him o old sir robert father on my knee i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee
why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
he hath a trick of coeur de lion s face the accent of his tongue affecteth him
do you not read some tokens of my son in the large composition of this man
mine eye hath well examined his parts and finds them perfect richard
sirrah speak what doth move you to claim your brother s land
because he hath a half face like my father
with half that face would he have all my land a half fac d groat five hundred pound a year
my gracious liege when that my father liv d your brother did employ my father much bastard
well sir by this you cannot get my land your tale must be how he employ d my mother
and once dispatch d him in an embassy to germany there with the emperor to treat of high affairs touching that time
th advantage of his absence took the king and in the meantime sojourn d at my father s where how he did prevail i shame to speak but truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores between my father and my mother lay as i have heard my father speak himself when this same lusty gentleman was got
upon his death bed he by will bequeath d his lands to me and took it on his death that this my mother s son was none of his and if he were he came into the world full fourteen weeks before the course of time
then good my liege let me have what is mine my father s land as was my father s will
sirrah your brother is legitimate your father s wife did after wedlock bear him and if she did play false the fault was hers which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands that marry wives
tell me how if my brother who as you say took pains to get this son had of your father claim d this son for his
in sooth good friend your father might have kept this calf bred from his cow from all the world in sooth he might then if he were my brother s my brother might not claim him nor your father being none of his refuse him
this concludes my mother s son did get your father s heir your father s heir must have your father s land
shall then my father s will be of no force to dispossess that child which is not his
of no more force to dispossess me sir than was his will to get me as i think
whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge and like thy brother to enjoy thy land or the reputed son of coeur de lion lord of thy presence and no land beside
madam an if my brother had my shape and i had his sir robert s his like him and if my legs were two such riding rods my arms such eel skins stuff d my face so thin that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose lest men should say look where three farthings goes
and to his shape were heir to all this land would i might never stir from off this place i would give it every foot to have this face
i would not be sir nob in any case
wilt thou forsake thy fortune bequeath thy land to him and follow me
i am a soldier and now bound to france
brother take you my land i ll take my chance
your face hath got five hundred pound a year yet sell your face for fivepence and tis dear
madam i ll follow you unto the death
nay i would have you go before me thither
our country manners give our betters way
philip my liege so is my name begun philip good old sir robert s wife s eldest son
from henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest kneel thou down philip but rise more great arise sir richard and plantagenet
brother by th mother s side give me your hand my father gave me honour yours gave land
now blessed be the hour by night or day when i was got sir robert was away
i am thy grandam richard call me so
madam by chance but not by truth what though
something about a little from the right in at the window or else o er the hatch who dares not stir by day must walk by night and have is have however men do catch
near or far off well won is still well shot and i am i howe er i was begot
go faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire a landless knight makes thee a landed squire
come madam and come richard we must speed for france for france for it is more than need
for thou wast got i th way of honesty
exeunt all but the bastard a foot of honour better than i was but many a many foot of land the worse
well now can i make any joan a lady
and if his name be george i ll call him peter for new made honour doth forget men s names tis too respective and too sociable for your conversion
now your traveller he and his toothpick at my worship s mess and when my knightly stomach is suffic d why then i suck my teeth and catechize my picked man of countries my dear sir thus leaning on mine elbow i begin i shall beseech you that is question now and then comes answer like an absey book o sir says answer at your best command at your employment at your service sir
no sir says question i sweet sir at yours
and so ere answer knows what question would saving in dialogue of compliment and talking of the alps and apennines the pyrenean and the river po it draws toward supper in conclusion so
but this is worshipful society and fits the mounting spirit like myself for he is but a bastard to the time that doth not smack of observation and so am i whether i smack or no and not alone in habit and device exterior form outward accoutrement but from the inward motion to deliver sweet sweet sweet poison for the age s tooth which though i will not practise to deceive yet to avoid deceit i mean to learn for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
but who comes in such haste in riding robes
hath she no husband that will take pains to blow a horn before her
enter lady faulconbridge and james gurney o me tis my mother
what brings you here to court so hastily
where is that slave thy brother
where is he that holds in chase mine honour up and down
my brother robert old sir robert s son
colbrand the giant that same mighty man

james gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
james there s toys abroad anon i ll tell thee more
exit gurney madam i was not old sir robert s son sir robert might have eat his part in me upon good friday and ne er broke his fast
sir robert could do well marry to confess could he get me
sir robert could not do it we know his handiwork
therefore good mother to whom am i beholding for these limbs
sir robert never holp to make this leg
hast thou conspired with thy brother too that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
what means this scorn thou most untoward knave
knight knight good mother basilisco like
i am dubb d i have it on my shoulder
but mother i am not sir robert s son i have disclaim d sir robert and my land legitimation name and all is gone
then good my mother let me know my father some proper man i hope
hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge
as faithfully as i deny the devil
king richard coeur de lion was thy father
by long and vehement suit i was seduc d to make room for him in my husband s bed
heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
thou art the issue of my dear offence which was so strongly urg d past my defence
now by this light were i to get again madam i would not wish a better father
some sins do bear their privilege on earth and so doth yours your fault was not your folly needs must you lay your heart at his dispose subjected tribute to commanding love against whose fury and unmatched force the aweless lion could not wage the fight nor keep his princely heart from richard s hand
he that perforce robs lions of their hearts may easily win a woman s
ay my mother with all my heart i thank thee for my father
who lives and dares but say thou didst not well when i was got i ll send his soul to hell
come lady i will show thee to my kin and they shall say when richard me begot if thou hadst said him nay it had been sin
who says it was he lies i say twas not
before angiers enter on one side austria and forces on the other king philip of france lewis the dauphin constance arthur and forces king philip
before angiers well met brave austria
arthur that great forerunner of thy blood richard that robb d the lion of his heart and fought the holy wars in palestine by this brave duke came early to his grave and for amends to his posterity at our importance hither is he come to spread his colours boy in thy behalf and to rebuke the usurpation of thy unnatural uncle english john
embrace him love him give him welcome hither
god shall forgive you coeur de lion s death the rather that you give his offspring life shadowing their right under your wings of war
i give you welcome with a powerless hand but with a heart full of unstained love welcome before the gates of angiers duke
who would not do thee right
upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss as seal to this indenture of my love that to my home i will no more return till angiers and the right thou hast in france together with that pale that white fac d shore whose foot spurns back the ocean s roaring tides and coops from other lands her islanders even till that england hedg d in with the main that water walled bulwark still secure and confident from foreign purposes even till that utmost corner of the west salute thee for her king
till then fair boy will i not think of home but follow arms
o take his mother s thanks a widow s thanks till your strong hand shall help to give him strength to make a more requital to your love
the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords in such a just and charitable war
our cannon shall be bent against the brows of this resisting town call for our chiefest men of discipline to cull the plots of best advantages
we ll lay before this town our royal bones wade to the market place in frenchmen s blood but we will make it subject to this boy
stay for an answer to your embassy lest unadvis d you stain your swords with blood my lord chatillon may from england bring that right in peace which here we urge in war and then we shall repent each drop of blood that hot rash haste so indirectly shed
lo upon thy wish our messenger chatillon is arriv d
what england says say briefly gentle lord we coldly pause for thee
then turn your forces from this paltry siege and stir them up against a mightier task
england impatient of your just demands hath put himself in arms
the adverse winds whose leisure i have stay d have given him time to land his legions all as soon as i his marches are expedient to this town his forces strong his soldiers confident
with him along is come the mother queen an ate stirring him to blood and strife with her the lady blanch of spain with them a bastard of the king s deceas d and all th unsettled humours of the land rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries with ladies faces and fierce dragons spleens have sold their fortunes at their native homes bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs to make a hazard of new fortunes here
in brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits than now the english bottoms have waft o er did never float upon the swelling tide to do offence and scathe in christendom
drum beats the interruption of their churlish drums cuts off more circumstance they are at hand to parley or to fight therefore prepare
how much unlook d for is this expedition
by how much unexpected by so much we must awake endeavour for defence for courage mounteth with occasion
let them be welcome then we are prepar d
enter king john elinor blanch the bastard pembroke and others king john
peace be to france if france in peace permit our just and lineal entrance to our own
if not bleed france and peace ascend to heaven whiles we god s wrathful agent do correct their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven
peace be to england if that war return from france to england there to live in peace
england we love and for that england s sake with burden of our armour here we sweat
this toil of ours should be a work of thine but thou from loving england art so far that thou hast under wrought his lawful king cut off the sequence of posterity outfaced infant state and done a rape upon the maiden virtue of the crown
look here upon thy brother geffrey s face these eyes these brows were moulded out of his this little abstract doth contain that large which died in geffrey and the hand of time shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
that geffrey was thy elder brother born and this his son england was geffrey s right and this is geffrey s
in the name of god how comes it then that thou art call d a king when living blood doth in these temples beat which owe the crown that thou o er masterest
from whom hast thou this great commission france to draw my answer from thy articles
from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts in any breast of strong authority to look into the blots and stains of right
that judge hath made me guardian to this boy under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong and by whose help i mean to chastise it
excuse it is to beat usurping down
who is it thou dost call usurper france
let me make answer thy usurping son
thy bastard shall be king that thou mayst be a queen and check the world
my bed was ever to thy son as true as thine was to thy husband and this boy liker in feature to his father geffrey than thou and john in manners being as eke as rain to water or devil to his dam
by my soul i think his father never was so true begot it cannot be an if thou wert his mother
there s a good mother boy that blots thy father
there s a good grandam boy that would blot thee
one that will play the devil sir with you an a may catch your hide and you alone
you are the hare of whom the proverb goes whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard i ll smoke your skin coat an i catch you right sirrah look to t i faith i will i faith
o well did he become that lion s robe that did disrobe the lion of that robe
it lies as sightly on the back of him as great alcides shows upon an ass but ass i ll take that burden from your back or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
what cracker is this same that deafs our ears with this abundance of superfluous breath
king philip determine what we shall do straight
women and fools break off your conference
king john this is the very sum of all england and ireland anjou touraine maine in right of arthur do i claim of thee wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
arthur of britaine yield thee to my hand and out of my dear love i ll give thee more than e er the coward hand of france can win
do child go to it grandam child give grandam kingdom and it grandam will give it a plum a cherry and a fig
i would that i were low laid in my grave i am not worth this coil that s made for me
his mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
now shame upon you whe er she does or no
his grandam s wrongs and not his mother s shames draws those heaven moving pearls from his poor eyes which heaven shall take in nature of a fee ay with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib d to do him justice and revenge on you
thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth call not me slanderer
thou and thine usurp the dominations royalties and rights of this oppressed boy this is thy eldest son s son infortunate in nothing but in thee
thy sins are visited in this poor child the canon of the law is laid on him being but the second generation removed from thy sin conceiving womb
i have but this to say that he is not only plagued for her sin but god hath made her sin and her the plague on this removed issue plagued for her and with her plague her sin his injury her injury the beadle to her sin all punish d in the person of this child and all for her a plague upon her
thou unadvised scold i can produce a will that bars the title of thy son
a will a wicked will a woman s will a cank red grandam s will
it ill beseems this presence to cry aim to these ill tuned repetitions
some trumpet summon hither to the walls these men of angiers let us hear them speak whose title they admit arthur s or john s
enter citizens upon the walls citizen
who is it that hath warn d us to the walls
you men of angiers and my loving subjects king philip
you loving men of angiers arthur s subjects our trumpet call d you to this gentle parle king john
for our advantage therefore hear us first
when i have said make answer to us both
lo in this right hand whose protection is most divinely vow d upon the right of him it holds stands young plantagenet son to the elder brother of this man and king o er him and all that he enjoys for this down trodden equity we tread in warlike march these greens before your town being no further enemy to you than the constraint of hospitable zeal in the relief of this oppressed child religiously provokes
be pleased then to pay that duty which you truly owe to him that owes it namely this young prince and then our arms like to a muzzled bear save in aspect hath all offence seal d up our cannons malice vainly shall be spent against th invulnerable clouds of heaven and with a blessed and unvex d retire with unhack d swords and helmets all unbruis d we will bear home that lusty blood again which here we came to spout against your town and leave your children wives and you in peace
but if you fondly pass our proffer d offer tis not the roundure of your old fac d walls can hide you from our messengers of war though all these english and their discipline were harbour d in their rude circumference
then tell us shall your city call us lord in that behalf which we have challeng d it or shall we give the signal to our rage and stalk in blood to our possession
in brief we are the king of england s subjects for him and in his right we hold this town
acknowledge then the king and let me in
that can we not but he that proves the king to him will we prove loyal
till that time have we ramm d up our gates against the world
doth not the crown of england prove the king
and if not that i bring you witnesses twice fifteen thousand hearts of england s breed bastard
to verify our title with their lives
as many and as well born bloods as those bastard
stand in his face to contradict his claim
till you compound whose right is worthiest we for the worthiest hold the right from both
then god forgive the sin of all those souls that to their everlasting residence before the dew of evening fall shall fleet in dreadful trial of our kingdom s king
saint george that swing d the dragon and e er since sits on s horse back at mine hostess door teach us some fence
to austria sirrah were i at home at your den sirrah with your lioness i would set an ox head to your lion s hide and make a monster of you
o tremble for you hear the lion roar
up higher to the plain where we ll set forth in best appointment all our regiments
speed then to take advantage of the field
it shall be so and at the other hill command the rest to stand
exeunt here after excursions enter the herald of france with trumpets to the gates french herald
you men of angiers open wide your gates and let young arthur duke of britaine in who by the hand of france this day hath made much work for tears in many an english mother whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground many a widow s husband grovelling lies coldly embracing the discoloured earth and victory with little loss doth play upon the dancing banners of the french who are at hand triumphantly displayed to enter conquerors and to proclaim arthur of britaine england s king and yours
enter english herald with trumpet english herald
rejoice you men of angiers ring your bells king john your king and england s doth approach commander of this hot malicious day
their armours that march d hence so silver bright hither return all gilt with frenchmen s blood
there stuck no plume in any english crest that is removed by a staff of france our colours do return in those same hands that did display them when we first march d forth and like a jolly troop of huntsmen come our lusty english all with purpled hands dy d in the dying slaughter of their foes
open your gates and give the victors way
heralds from off our tow rs we might behold from first to last the onset and retire of both your armies whose equality by our best eyes cannot be censured
blood hath bought blood and blows have answer d blows strength match d with strength and power confronted power both are alike and both alike we like
while they weigh so even we hold our town for neither yet for both
enter the two kings with their powers at several doors king john
france hast thou yet more blood to cast away
say shall the current of our right run on
whose passage vex d with thy impediment shall leave his native channel and o erswell with course disturb d even thy confining shores unless thou let his silver water keep a peaceful progress to the ocean
england thou hast not sav d one drop of blood in this hot trial more than we of france rather lost more
and by this hand i swear that sways the earth this climate overlooks before we will lay down our just borne arms we ll put thee down gainst whom these arms we bear or add a royal number to the dead gracing the scroll that tells of this war s loss with slaughter coupled to the name of kings
how high thy glory tow rs when the rich blood of kings is set on fire
o now doth death line his dead chaps with steel the swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs and now he feasts mousing the flesh of men in undetermin d differences of kings
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
kings back to the stained field you equal potents fiery kindled spirits
then let confusion of one part confirm the other s peace
till then blows blood and death
whose party do the townsmen yet admit
speak citizens for england who s your king
the king of england when we know the king
know him in us that here hold up his right
in us that are our own great deputy and bear possession of our person here lord of our presence angiers and of you
a greater pow r than we denies all this and till it be undoubted we do lock our former scruple in our strong barr d gates king d of our fears until our fears resolv d be by some certain king purg d and depos d
by heaven these scroyles of angiers flout you kings and stand securely on their battlements as in a theatre whence they gape and point at your industrious scenes and acts of death
your royal presences be rul d by me do like the mutines of jerusalem be friends awhile and both conjointly bend your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
by east and west let france and england mount their battering cannon charged to the mouths till their soul fearing clamours have brawl d down the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
i d play incessantly upon these jades even till unfenced desolation leave them as naked as the vulgar air
that done dissever your united strengths and part your mingled colours once again turn face to face and bloody point to point then in a moment fortune shall cull forth out of one side her happy minion to whom in favour she shall give the day and kiss him with a glorious victory
how like you this wild counsel mighty states
smacks it not something of the policy
now by the sky that hangs above our heads i like it well
france shall we knit our pow rs and lay this angiers even with the ground then after fight who shall be king of it
an if thou hast the mettle of a king being wrong d as we are by this peevish town turn thou the mouth of thy artillery as we will ours against these saucy walls and when that we have dash d them to the ground why then defy each other and pell mell make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
we from the west will send destruction into this city s bosom
our thunder from the south shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
from north to south austria and france shoot in each other s mouth
i ll stir them to it come away away
hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay and i shall show you peace and fair fac d league win you this city without stroke or wound rescue those breathing lives to die in beds that here come sacrifices for the field
persever not but hear me mighty kings
speak on with favour we are bent to hear
that daughter there of spain the lady blanch is niece to england look upon the years of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid
if lusty love should go in quest of beauty where should he find it fairer than in blanch
if zealous love should go in search of virtue where should he find it purer than in blanch
if love ambitious sought a match of birth whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch
such as she is in beauty virtue birth is the young dauphin every way complete if not complete of say he is not she and she again wants nothing to name want if want it be not that she is not he
he is the half part of a blessed man left to be finished by such as she and she a fair divided excellence whose fulness of perfection lies in him
o two such silver currents when they join do glorify the banks that bound them in and two such shores to two such streams made one two such controlling bounds shall you be kings to these two princes if you marry them
this union shall do more than battery can to our fast closed gates for at this match with swifter spleen than powder can enforce the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope and give you entrance but without this match the sea enraged is not half so deaf lions more confident mountains and rocks more free from motion no not death himself in mortal fury half so peremptory as we to keep this city
here s a stay that shakes the rotten carcass of old death out of his rags
here s a large mouth indeed that spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas talks as familiarly of roaring lions as maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs
what cannoneer begot this lusty blood
he speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce he gives the bastinado with his tongue our ears are cudgell d not a word of his but buffets better than a fist of france
i was never so bethump d with words since i first call d my brother s father dad
son list to this conjunction make this match give with our niece a dowry large enough for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie thy now unsur d assurance to the crown that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
i see a yielding in the looks of france mark how they whisper
urge them while their souls are capable of this ambition lest zeal now melted by the windy breath of soft petitions pity and remorse cool and congeal again to what it was
why answer not the double majesties this friendly treaty of our threat ned town
speak england first that hath been forward first to speak unto this city what say you
if that the dauphin there thy princely son can in this book of beauty read i love her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen for anjou and fair touraine maine poictiers and all that we upon this side the sea except this city now by us besieg d find liable to our crown and dignity shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich in titles honours and promotions as she in beauty education blood holds hand with any princess of the world
look in the lady s face
i do my lord and in her eye i find a wonder or a wondrous miracle the shadow of myself form d in her eye which being but the shadow of your son becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
i do protest i never lov d myself till now infixed i beheld myself drawn in the flattering table of her eye
aside drawn in the flattering table of her eye hang d in the frowning wrinkle of her brow and quarter d in her heart he doth espy himself love s traitor
this is pity now that hang d and drawn and quarter d there should be in such a love so vile a lout as he
my uncle s will in this respect is mine
if he see aught in you that makes him like that anything he sees which moves his liking i can with ease translate it to my will or if you will to speak more properly i will enforce it eas ly to my love
further i will not flatter you my lord that all i see in you is worthy love than this that nothing do i see in you though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge that i can find should merit any hate
that she is bound in honour still to do what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
speak then prince dauphin can you love this lady
nay ask me if i can refrain from love for i do love her most unfeignedly
then do i give volquessen touraine maine poictiers and anjou these five provinces with her to thee and this addition more full thirty thousand marks of english coin
philip of france if thou be pleas d withal command thy son and daughter to join hands
it likes us well young princes close your hands
and your lips too for i am well assur d that i did so when i was first assur d
now citizens of angiers ope your gates let in that amity which you have made for at saint mary s chapel presently the rites of marriage shall be solemniz d
is not the lady constance in this troop
i know she is not for this match made up her presence would have interrupted much
where is she and her son
she is sad and passionate at your highness tent
and by my faith this league that we have made will give her sadness very little cure
brother of england how may we content this widow lady
in her right we came which we god knows have turn d another way to our own vantage
we will heal up all for we ll create young arthur duke of britaine and earl of richmond and this rich fair town we make him lord of
call the lady constance some speedy messenger bid her repair to our solemnity
i trust we shall if not fill up the measure of her will yet in some measure satisfy her so that we shall stop her exclamation
go we as well as haste will suffer us to this unlook d for unprepared pomp
exeunt all but the bastard bastard
and why rail i on this commodity
but for because he hath not woo d me yet not that i have the power to clutch my hand when his fair angels would salute my palm but for my hand as unattempted yet like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
well whiles i am a beggar i will rail and say there is no sin but to be rich and being rich my virtue then shall be to say there is no vice but beggary
since kings break faith upon commodity gain be my lord for i will worship thee
the french king s camp enter constance arthur and salisbury constance
false blood to false blood join d
shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces
it is not so thou hast misspoke misheard be well advis d tell o er thy tale again
it cannot be thou dost but say tis so i trust i may not trust thee for thy word is but the vain breath of a common man believe me i do not believe thee man i have a king s oath to the contrary
thou shalt be punish d for thus frighting me for i am sick and capable of fears oppress d with wrongs and therefore full of fears a widow husbandless subject to fears a woman naturally born to fears and though thou now confess thou didst but jest with my vex d spirits i cannot take a truce but they will quake and tremble all this day
what dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
why dost thou look so sadly on my son
what means that hand upon that breast of thine
why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum like a proud river peering o er his bounds
be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
then speak again not all thy former tale but this one word whether thy tale be true
as true as i believe you think them false that give you cause to prove my saying true
o if thou teach me to believe this sorrow teach thou this sorrow how to make me die and let belief and life encounter so as doth the fury of two desperate men which in the very meeting fall and die
o boy then where art thou
france friend with england what becomes of me
fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight this news hath made thee a most ugly man
what other harm have i good lady done but spoke the harm that is by others done
which harm within itself so heinous is as it makes harmful all that speak of it
i do beseech you madam be content
if thou that bid st me be content wert grim ugly and sland rous to thy mother s womb full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains lame foolish crooked swart prodigious patch d with foul moles and eye offending marks i would not care i then would be content for then i should not love thee no nor thou become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy nature and fortune join d to make thee great of nature s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast and with the half blown rose but fortune o
she is corrupted chang d and won from thee sh adulterates hourly with thine uncle john and with her golden hand hath pluck d on france to tread down fair respect of sovereignty and made his majesty the bawd to theirs
france is a bawd to fortune and king john that strumpet fortune that usurping john
tell me thou fellow is not france forsworn
envenom him with words or get thee gone and leave those woes alone which i alone am bound to under bear
pardon me madam i may not go without you to the kings
thou mayst thou shalt i will not go with thee i will instruct my sorrows to be proud for grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
to me and to the state of my great grief let kings assemble for my grief s so great that no supporter but the huge firm earth can hold it up
seats herself on the ground here i and sorrows sit here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
enter king john king philip lewis blanch elinor the bastard austria and attendants king philip
tis true fair daughter and this blessed day ever in france shall be kept festival
to solemnize this day the glorious sun stays in his course and plays the alchemist turning with splendour of his precious eye the meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
the yearly course that brings this day about shall never see it but a holiday
rising a wicked day and not a holy day
what hath this day deserv d
what hath it done that it in golden letters should be set among the high tides in the calendar
nay rather turn this day out of the week this day of shame oppression perjury or if it must stand still let wives with child pray that their burdens may not fall this day lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross d but on this day let seamen fear no wreck no bargains break that are not this day made this day all things begun come to ill end yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
by heaven lady you shall have no cause to curse the fair proceedings of this day
have i not pawn d to you my majesty
you have beguil d me with a counterfeit resembling majesty which being touch d and tried proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn you came in arms to spill mine enemies blood but now in arms you strengthen it with yours
the grappling vigour and rough frown of war is cold in amity and painted peace and our oppression hath made up this league
arm arm you heavens against these perjur d kings
a widow cries be husband to me heavens
let not the hours of this ungodly day wear out the day in peace but ere sunset set armed discord twixt these perjur d kings
peace is to me a war
thou dost shame that bloody spoil
thou slave thou wretch thou coward
thou little valiant great in villainy
thou ever strong upon the stronger side
thou fortune s champion that dost never fight but when her humorous ladyship is by to teach thee safety
thou art perjur d too and sooth st up greatness
what a fool art thou a ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear upon my party
thou cold blooded slave hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side been sworn my soldier bidding me depend upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength and dost thou now fall over to my foes
thou wear a lion s hide
doff it for shame and hang a calf s skin on those recreant limbs
o that a man should speak those words to me
and hang a calf s skin on those recreant limbs
thou dar st not say so villain for thy life
and hang a calf s skin on those recreant limbs
we like not this thou dost forget thyself
here comes the holy legate of the pope
hail you anointed deputies of heaven
to thee king john my holy errand is
i pandulph of fair milan cardinal and from pope innocent the legate here do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church our holy mother so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce keep stephen langton chosen archbishop of canterbury from that holy see
this in our foresaid holy father s name pope innocent i do demand of thee
what earthly name to interrogatories can task the free breath of a sacred king
thou canst not cardinal devise a name so slight unworthy and ridiculous to charge me to an answer as the pope
tell him this tale and from the mouth of england add thus much more that no italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions but as we under heaven are supreme head so under him that great supremacy where we do reign we will alone uphold without th assistance of a mortal hand
so tell the pope all reverence set apart to him and his usurp d authority
brother of england you blaspheme in this
though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the merit of vile gold dross dust purchase corrupted pardon of a man who in that sale sells pardon from himself though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish yet i alone alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes
then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand curs d and excommunicate and blessed shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritorious shall that hand be call d canonized and worshipp d as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life
o lawful let it be that i have room with rome to curse awhile
good father cardinal cry thou amen to my keen curses for without my wrong there is no tongue hath power to curse him right
there s law and warrant lady for my curse
and for mine too when law can do no right let it be lawful that law bar no wrong law cannot give my child his kingdom here for he that holds his kingdom holds the law therefore since law itself is perfect wrong how can the law forbid my tongue to curse
philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that arch heretic and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome
do not let go thy hand
look to that devil lest that france repent and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
king philip listen to the cardinal
and hang a calf s skin on his recreant limbs
well ruffian i must pocket up these wrongs because bastard
your breeches best may carry them
philip what say st thou to the cardinal
what should he say but as the cardinal
bethink you father for the difference is purchase of a heavy curse from rome or the light loss of england for a friend
that s the curse of rome
the devil tempts thee here in likeness of a new untrimmed bride
the lady constance speaks not from her faith but from her need
o if thou grant my need which only lives but by the death of faith that need must needs infer this principle that faith would live again by death of need
o then tread down my need and faith mounts up keep my need up and faith is trodden down
the king is mov d and answers not to this
o be remov d from him and answer well
do so king philip hang no more in doubt
hang nothing but a calf s skin most sweet lout
i am perplex d and know not what to say
what canst thou say but will perplex thee more if thou stand excommunicate and curs d
good reverend father make my person yours and tell me how you would bestow yourself
and shall these hands so lately purg d of blood so newly join d in love so strong in both unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
play fast and loose with faith
so jest with heaven make such unconstant children of ourselves as now again to snatch our palm from palm unswear faith sworn and on the marriage bed of smiling peace to march a bloody host and make a riot on the gentle brow of true sincerity
o holy sir my reverend father let it not be so
out of your grace devise ordain impose some gentle order and then we shall be blest to do your pleasure and continue friends
all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to england s love
be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mother s curse on her revolting son
france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chafed lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
i may disjoin my hand but not my faith
so mak st thou faith an enemy to faith and like
a civil war set st oath to oath
o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven perform d that is to be the champion of our church
what since thou swor st is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one new burn d
it is religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion by what thou swear st against the thing thou swear st and mak st an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear
but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our pray rs come in if thou vouchsafe them
but if not then know the peril of our curses fight on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under the black weight
will not a calf s skin stop that mouth of thine
against the blood that thou hast married
what shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men
shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
ay alack how new is husband in my mouth
even for that name which till this time my tongue did ne er pronounce upon my knee i beg go not to arms against mine uncle
o upon my knee made hard with kneeling i do pray to thee thou virtuous dauphin alter not the doom forethought by heaven
now shall i see thy love
what motive may be stronger with thee than the name of wife
that which upholdeth him that thee upholds his honour
o thine honour lewis thine honour
i muse your majesty doth seem so cold when such profound respects do pull you on
i will denounce a curse upon his head
england i will fall from thee
o fair return of banish d majesty
o foul revolt of french inconstancy
france thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
old time the clock setter that bald sexton time is it as he will
the sun s o ercast with blood
which is the side that i must go withal
i am with both each army hath a hand and in their rage i having hold of both they whirl asunder and dismember me
husband i cannot pray that thou mayst win uncle i needs must pray that thou mayst lose father i may not wish the fortune thine grandam i will not wish thy wishes thrive
whoever wins on that side shall i lose assured loss before the match be play d
lady with me with me thy fortune lies
there where my fortune lives there my life dies
cousin go draw our puissance together
exit bastard france i am burn d up with inflaming wrath a rage whose heat hath this condition that nothing can allay nothing but blood the blood and dearest valu d blood of france
thy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turn to ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
look to thyself thou art in jeopardy
no more than he that threats
enter the bastard with austria s head bastard
now by my life this day grows wondrous hot some airy devil hovers in the sky and pours down mischief
austria s head lie there while philip breathes
enter king john arthur and hubert king john
philip make up my mother is assailed in our tent and ta en i fear
my lord i rescued her her highness is in safety fear you not but on my liege for very little pains will bring this labour to an happy end
plains near angiers alarums excursions retreat
enter king john elinor arthur the bastard hubert and lords king john
to elinor so shall it be your grace shall stay behind so strongly guarded
to arthur cousin look not sad thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will as dear be to thee as thy father was
o this will make my mother die with grief
to the bastard cousin away for england
haste before and ere our coming see thou shake the bags of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels set at liberty the fat ribs of peace must by the hungry now be fed upon
use our commission in his utmost force
bell book and candle shall not drive me back when gold and silver becks me to come on
grandam i will pray if ever i remember to be holy for your fair safety
come hither little kinsman hark a word
o my gentle hubert we owe thee much
within this wall of flesh there is a soul counts thee her creditor and with advantage means to pay thy love and my good friend thy voluntary oath lives in this bosom dearly cherished
i had a thing to say but i will fit it with some better time
by heaven hubert i am almost asham d to say what good respect i have of thee
i am much bounden to your majesty
good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet but thou shalt have and creep time ne er so slow yet it shall come for me to do thee good
i had a thing to say but let it go the sun is in the heaven and the proud day attended with the pleasures of the world is all too wanton and too full of gawds to give me audience
yet i love thee well and by my troth i think thou lov st me well
so well that what you bid me undertake though that my death were adjunct to my act by heaven i would do it
do not i know thou wouldst
good hubert hubert hubert throw thine eye on yon young boy
i ll tell thee what my friend he is a very serpent in my way and wheresoe er this foot of mine doth tread he lies before me
and i ll keep him so that he shall not offend your majesty
well i ll not say what i intend for thee
madam fare you well i ll send those powers o er to your majesty
to arthur for england cousin go hubert shall be your man attend on you with all true duty
the french king s camp enter king philip lewis pandulph and attendants king philip
so by a roaring tempest on the flood a whole armado of convicted sail is scattered and disjoin d from fellowship
what can go well when we have run so ill are we not beaten
and bloody england into england gone o erbearing interruption spite of france
he hath won that hath he fortified so hot a speed with such advice dispos d such temperate order in so fierce a cause doth want example who hath read or heard of any kindred action like to this
well could i bear that england had this praise so we could find some pattern of our shame
enter constance look who comes here
a grave unto a soul holding th eternal spirit against her will in the vile prison of afflicted breath
i prithee lady go away with me
now see the issue of your peace
no i defy all counsel all redress but that which ends all counsel true redress death death o amiable lovely death
arise forth from the couch of lasting night thou hate and terror to prosperity and i will kiss thy detestable bones and put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows and ring these fingers with thy household worms and stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust and be a carrion monster like thyself
come grin on me and i will think thou smil st and buss thee as thy wife
misery s love o come to me
no no i will not having breath to cry
o that my tongue were in the thunder s mouth
then with a passion would i shake the world and rouse from sleep that fell anatomy which cannot hear a lady s feeble voice which scorns a modern invocation
lady you utter madness and not sorrow
thou art not holy to belie me so
i am not mad this hair i tear is mine my name is constance i was geffrey s wife young arthur is my son and he is lost
i am not mad i would to heaven i were
for then tis like i should forget myself
o if i could what grief should i forget
preach some philosophy to make me mad and thou shalt be canoniz d cardinal for being not mad but sensible of grief my reasonable part produces reason how i may be deliver d of these woes and teaches me to kill or hang myself
if i were mad i should forget my son or madly think a babe of clouts were he
i am not mad too well too well i feel the different plague of each calamity
o what love i note in the fair multitude of those her hairs
where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall n even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends do glue themselves in sociable grief like true inseparable faithful loves sticking together in calamity
yes that i will and wherefore will i do it
i tore them from their bonds and cried aloud o that these hands could so redeem my son as they have given these hairs their liberty
but now i envy at their liberty and will again commit them to their bonds because my poor child is a prisoner
and father cardinal i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be true i shall see my boy again for since the birth of cain the first male child to him that did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born
but now will canker sorrow eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost as dim and meagre as an ague s fit and so he ll die and rising so again when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him
therefore never never must i behold my pretty arthur more
you hold too heinous a respect of grief
he talks to me that never had a son
you are as fond of grief as of your child
grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words remembers me of all his gracious parts stuffs out his vacant garments with his form then have i reason to be fond of grief
fare you well had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do
i will not keep this form upon my head tearing her hair when there is such disorder in my wit
my boy my arthur my fair son
my life my joy my food my ail the world
my widow comfort and my sorrows cure
i fear some outrage and i ll follow her
there s nothing in this world can make me joy
life is as tedious as a twice told tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man and bitter shame hath spoil d the sweet world s taste that it yields nought but shame and bitterness
before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day
all days of glory joy and happiness
if you had won it certainly you had
no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threat ning eye
tis strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won
are not you griev d that arthur is his prisoner
as heartily as he is glad he hath him
your mind is all as youthful as your blood
now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust each straw each little rub out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to england s throne
and therefore mark john hath seiz d arthur and it cannot be that whiles warm life plays in that infant s veins the misplac d john should entertain an hour one minute nay one quiet breath of rest
a sceptre snatch d with an unruly hand must be boisterously maintain d as gain d and he that stands upon a slipp ry place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand then arthur needs must fall so be it for it cannot be but so
but what shall i gain by young arthur s fall
you in the right of lady blanch your wife may then make all the claim that arthur did
and lose it life and all as arthur did
how green you are and fresh in this old world
john lays you plots the times conspire with you for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue
this act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that none so small advantage shall step forth to check his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no scope of nature no distemper d day no common wind no customed event but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives presages and tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john
may be he will not touch young arthur s life but hold himself safe in his prisonment
o sir when he shall hear of your approach if that young arthur be not gone already even at that news he dies and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers ends of john
methinks i see this hurly all on foot and o what better matter breeds for you than i have nam d
the bastard faulconbridge is now in england ransacking the church offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms they would be as a can to train ten thousand english to their side or as a little snow tumbled about anon becomes a mountain
o noble dauphin go with me to the king
tis wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent now that their souls are topful of offence
for england go i will whet on the king
let us go if you say ay the king will not say no
a castle enter hubert and executioners hubert
heat me these irons hot and look thou stand within the arras
when i strike my foot upon the bosom of the ground rush forth and bind the boy which you shall find with me fast to the chair
i hope your warrant will bear out the deed
exeunt executioners young lad come forth i have to say with you
as little prince having so great a tide to be more prince as may be
methinks no body should be sad but i yet i remember when i was in france young gentlemen would be as sad as night only for wantonness
by my christendom so i were out of prison and kept sheep i should be as merry as the day is long and so i would be here but that i doubt my uncle practises more harm to me he is afraid of me and i of him
is it my fault that i was geffrey s son
no indeed ist not and i would to heaven i were your son so you would love me hubert
aside if i talk to him with his innocent prate he will awake my mercy which lies dead therefore i will be sudden and dispatch
you look pale to day in sooth i would you were a little sick that i might sit all night and watch with you
i warrant i love you more than you do me
aside his words do take possession of my bosom read here young arthur
showing a paper aside how now foolish rheum
turning dispiteous torture out of door
i must be brief lest resolution drop out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears can you not read it
too fairly hubert for so foul effect
must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
when your head did but ache i knit my handkerchief about your brows the best i had a princess wrought it me and i did never ask it you again and with my hand at midnight held your head and like the watchful minutes to the hour still and anon cheer d up the heavy time saying what lack you
or what good love may i perform for you
many a poor man s son would have lyen still and ne er have spoke a loving word to you but you at your sick service had a prince
nay you may think my love was crafty love and call it cunning
if heaven be pleas d that you must use me ill why then you must
will you put out mine eyes these eyes that never did nor never shall so much as frown on you
i have sworn to do it and with hot irons must i burn them out
ah none but in this iron age would do it
the iron of itself though heat red hot approaching near these eyes would drink my tears and quench his fiery indignation even in the matter of mine innocence nay after that consume away in rust but for containing fire to harm mine eye
are you more stubborn hard than hammer d iron
an if an angel should have come to me and told me hubert should put out mine eyes i would not have believ d him no tongue but hubert s
re enter executioners with cord irons etc
do as i bid you do
o save me hubert save me
my eyes are out even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
give me the iron i say and bind him here
alas what need you be so boist rous rough
i will not struggle i will stand stone still
for heaven sake hubert let me not be bound
drive these men away and i will sit as quiet as a lamb i will not stir nor wince nor speak a word nor look upon the iron angrily thrust but these men away and i ll forgive you whatever torment you do put me to
go stand within let me alone with him
i am best pleas d to be from such a deed
alas i then have chid away my friend
he hath a stern look but a gentle heart
let him come back that his compassion may give life to yours
none but to lose your eyes
o heaven that there were but a mote in yours a grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair any annoyance in that precious sense
then feeling what small things are boisterous there your vile intent must needs seem horrible
hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
let me not hold my tongue let me not hubert or hubert if you will cut out my tongue so i may keep mine eyes
o spare mine eyes though to no use but still to look on you
lo by my troth the instrument is cold and would not harm me
no in good sooth the fire is dead with grief being create for comfort to be us d in undeserved extremes
see else yourself there is no malice in this burning coal the breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out and strew d repentant ashes on his head
but with my breath i can revive it boy
an if you do you will but make it blush and glow with shame of your proceedings hubert
nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes and like a dog that is compell d to fight snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
all things that you should use to do me wrong deny their office only you do lack that mercy which fierce fire and iron extends creatures of note for mercy lacking uses
well see to live i will not touch thine eye for all the treasure that thine uncle owes
yet i am sworn and i did purpose boy with this same very iron to burn them out
o now you look like hubert
all this while you were disguis d
your uncle must not know but you are dead i ll fill these dogged spies with false reports and pretty child sleep doubtless and secure that hubert for the wealth of all the world will not offend thee
much danger do i undergo for thee
king john s palace enter king john pembroke salisbury and other lords king john
here once again we sit once again crown d and look d upon i hope with cheerful eyes
this once again but that your highness pleas d was once superfluous you were crown d before and that high royalty was ne er pluck d off the faiths of men ne er stained with revolt fresh expectation troubled not the land with any long d for change or better state
therefore to be possess d with double pomp to guard a title that was rich before to gild refined gold to paint the lily to throw a perfume on the violet to smooth the ice or add another hue unto the rainbow or with taper light to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish is wasteful and ridiculous excess
but that your royal pleasure must be done this act is as an ancient tale new told and in the last repeating troublesome being urged at a time unseasonable
in this the antique and well noted face of plain old form is much disfigured and like a shifted wind unto a sail it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about startles and frights consideration makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected for putting on so new a fashion d robe
when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their skill in covetousness and oftentimes excusing of a fault doth make the fault the worse by th excuse as patches set upon a little breach discredit more in hiding of the fault than did the fault before it was so patch d
to this effect before you were new crown d we breath d our counsel but it pleas d your highness to overbear it and we are all well pleas d since all and every part of what we would doth make a stand at what your highness will
some reasons of this double coronation i have possess d you with and think them strong and more more strong when lesser is my fear i shall indue you with
meantime but ask what you would have reform d that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your requests
that the time s enemies may not have this to grace occasions let it be our suit that you have bid us ask his liberty which for our goods we do no further ask than whereupon our weal on you depending counts it your weal he have his liberty
i do commit his youth to your direction
enter hubert aside hubert what news with you
this is the man should do the bloody deed he show d his warrant to a friend of mine the image of a wicked heinous fault lives in his eye that close aspect of his doth show the mood of a much troubled breast and i do fearfully believe tis done what we so fear d he had a charge to do
the colour of the king doth come and go between his purpose and his conscience like heralds twixt two dreadful battles set
his passion is so ripe it needs must break
and when it breaks i fear will issue thence the foul corruption of a sweet child s death
we cannot hold mortality s strong hand
good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceas d to night
indeed we fear d his sickness was past cure
indeed we heard how near his death he was before the child himself felt he was sick
this must be answer d either here or hence
why do you bend such solemn brows on me
think you i bear the shears of destiny
have i commandment on the pulse of life
it is apparent foul play and tis shame that greatness should so grossly offer it
so thrive it in your game
stay yet lord salisbury i ll go with thee and find th inheritance of this poor child his little kingdom of a forced grave
that blood which ow d the breadth of all this isle three foot of it doth hold bad world the while
this must not be thus borne this will break out to all our sorrows and ere long i doubt
there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achiev d by others death
enter a messenger a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks
so foul a sky clears not without a storm
pour down thy weather how goes all in france
never such a pow r for any foreign preparation was levied in the body of a land
the copy of your speed is learn d by them for when you should be told they do prepare the tidings comes that they are all arriv d
o where hath our intelligence been drunk
where is my mother s care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it
my liege her ear is stopp d with dust the first of april died your noble mother and as i hear my lord the lady constance in a frenzy died three days before but this from rumour s tongue i idly heard if true or false i know not
o make a league with me till i have pleas d my discontented peers
how wildly then walks my estate in france
under whose conduct came those pow rs of france that thou for truth giv st out are landed here
thou hast made me giddy with these in tidings
enter the bastard and peter of pomfret now
what says the world to your proceedings
do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news for it is full
but if you be afear d to hear the worst then let the worst unheard fall on your head
bear with me cousin for i was amaz d under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will
how i have sped among the clergymen the sums i have collected shall express
but as i travell d hither through the land i find the people strangely fantasied possess d with rumours full of idle dreams
not knowing what they fear but full of fear and here s a prophet that i brought with me from forth the streets of pomfret whom i found with many hundreds treading on his heels to whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes that ere the next ascension day at noon your highness should deliver up your crown
thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hang d
deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee
exit hubert with peter o my gentle cousin hear st thou the news abroad who are arriv d
the french my lord men s mouths are full of it besides i met lord bigot and lord salisbury with eyes as red as new enkindled fire and others more going to seek the grave of arthur whom they say is kill d to night on your suggestion
gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies
i have a way to will their loves again bring them before me
nay but make haste the better foot before
o let me have no subject enemies when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion
be mercury set feathers to thy heels and fly like thought from them to me again
the spirit of the time shall teach me speed
spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
exit bastard go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he
with all my heart my liege
my lord they say five moons were seen to night four fixed and the fifth did whirl about the other four in wondrous motion
old men and beldams in the streets do prophesy upon it dangerously young arthur s death is common in their mouths and when they talk of him they shake their heads and whisper one another in the ear and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer s wrist whilst he that hears makes fearful action with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool with open mouth swallowing a tailor s news who with his shears and measure in his hand standing on slippers which his nimble haste had falsely thrust upon contrary feet told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattailed and rank d in kent
another lean unwash d artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthur s death
why seek st thou to possess me with these fears
why urgest thou so oft young arthur s death
thy hand hath murd red him
i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
why did you not provoke me
it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humours for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humour than advis d respect
here is your hand and seal for what i did
o when the last account twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation
how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done
hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature mark d quoted and sign d to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorr d aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employ d in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur s death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince
hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause when i spake darkly what i purposed or turn d an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name
out of my sight and never see me more
my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign pow rs nay in the body of the fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin s death
arm you against your other enemies i ll make a peace between your soul and you
this hand of mine is yet a maiden and an innocent hand not painted with the crimson spots of blood
within this bosom never ent red yet the dreadful motion of a murderous thought and you have slander d nature in my form which howsoever rude exteriorly is yet the cover of a fairer mind than to be butcher of an innocent child
o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensed rage and make them tame to their obedience
forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art
o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste
i conjure thee but slowly run more fast
before the castle enter arthur on the walls arthur
the wall is high and yet will i leap down
good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
there s few or none do know me if they did this ship boy s semblance hath disguis d me quite
i am afraid and yet i ll venture it
if i get down and do not break my limbs i ll find a thousand shifts to get away
as good to die and go as die and stay
my uncle s spirit is in these stones
heaven take my soul and england keep my bones
dies enter pembroke salisbury and bigot salisbury
lords i will meet him at saint edmundsbury it is our safety and we must embrace this gentle offer of the perilous time
who brought that letter from the cardinal
the count melun a noble lord of france whose private with me of the dauphin s love is much more general than these lines import
to morrow morning let us meet him then
or rather then set forward for twill be two long days journey lords or ere we meet
once more to day well met distemper d lords
the king by me requests your presence straight
the king hath dispossess d himself of us
we will not line his thin bestained cloak with our pure honours nor attend the foot that leaves the print of blood where er it walks
whate er you think good words i think were best
our griefs and not our manners reason now
but there is little reason in your grief therefore twere reason you had manners now
sir sir impatience hath his privilege
tis true to hurt his master no man else
o death made proud with pure and princely beauty
the earth had not a hole to hide this deed
murder as hating what himself hath done doth lay it open to urge on revenge
or when he doom d this beauty to a grave found it too precious princely for a grave
have you beheld or have you read or heard or could you think
or do you almost think although you see that you do see
could thought without this object form such another
this is the very top the height the crest or crest unto the crest of murder s arms this is the bloodiest shame the wildest savagery the vilest stroke that ever wall ey d wrath or staring rage presented to the tears of soft remorse
all murders past do stand excus d in this and this so sole and so unmatchable shall give a holiness a purity to the yet unbegotten sin of times and prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest exampled by this heinous spectacle
it is a damned and a bloody work the graceless action of a heavy hand if that it be the work of any hand
if that it be the work of any hand
we had a kind of light what would ensue
it is the shameful work of hubert s hand the practice and the purpose of the king from whose obedience i forbid my soul kneeling before this ruin of sweet life and breathing to his breathless excellence the incense of a vow a holy vow never to taste the pleasures of the world never to be infected with delight nor conversant with ease and idleness till i have set a glory to this hand by giving it the worship of revenge
our souls religiously confirm thy words
lords i am hot with haste in seeking you
arthur doth live the king hath sent for you
o he is bold and blushes not at death
avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
your sword is bright sir put it up again
not till i sheathe it in a murderer s skin
stand back lord salisbury stand back i say by heaven i think my sword s as sharp as yours
i would not have you lord forget yourself nor tempt the danger of my true defence lest i by marking of your rage forget your worth your greatness and nobility
dar st thou brave a nobleman
not for my life but yet i dare defend my innocent life against an emperor
whose tongue soe er speaks false not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
stand by or i shall gall you faulconbridge
thou wert better gall the devil salisbury
if thou but frown on me or stir thy foot or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame i ll strike thee dead
put up thy sword betime or i ll so maul you and your toasting iron that you shall think the devil is come from hell
what wilt thou do renowned faulconbridge
second a villain and a murderer
tis not an hour since i left him well
i honour d him i lov d him and will weep my date of life out for his sweet life s loss
trust not those cunning waters of his eyes for villainy is not without such rheum and he long traded in it makes it seem like rivers of remorse and innocency
away with me all you whose souls abhor th uncleanly savours of a slaughter house for i am stifled with this smell of sin
away toward bury to the dauphin there
there tell the king he may inquire us out
knew you of this fair work
beyond the infinite and boundless reach of mercy if thou didst this deed of death art thou damn d hubert
i ll tell thee what thou rt damn d as black nay nothing is so black thou art more deep damn d than prince lucifer there is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell as thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
if thou didst but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou want st a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up i do suspect thee very grievously
if i in act consent or sin of thought be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath which was embounded in this beauteous clay let hell want pains enough to torture me
go bear him in thine arms
i am amaz d methinks and lose my way among the thorns and dangers of this world
how easy dost thou take all england up
from forth this morsel of dead royalty the life the right and truth of all this realm is fled to heaven and england now is left to tug and scamble and to part by th teeth the unowed interest of proud swelling state
now for the bare pick d bone of majesty doth dogged war bristle his angry crest and snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace now powers from home and discontents at home meet in one line and vast confusion waits as doth a raven on a sick fall n beast the imminent decay of wrested pomp
now happy he whose cloak and cincture can hold out this tempest
bear away that child and follow me with speed
i ll to the king a thousand businesses are brief in hand and heaven itself doth frown upon the land
king john s palace enter king john pandulph and attendants king john
thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory
gives back the crown take again from this my hand as holding of the pope your sovereign greatness and authority
now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches fore we are inflam d
our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty
this inundation of mistemp red humour rests by you only to be qualified
then pause not for the present time s so sick that present med cine must be minist red or overthrow incurable ensues
it was my breath that blew this tempest up upon your stubborn usage of the pope but since you are a gentle convertite my tongue shall hush again this storm of war and make fair weather in your blust ring land
on this ascension day remember well upon your oath of service to the pope go i to make the french lay down their arms
did not the prophet say that before ascension day at noon my crown i should give off
i did suppose it should be on constraint but heaven be thank d it is but voluntary
all kent hath yielded nothing there holds out but dover castle
london hath receiv d like a kind host the dauphin and his powers
your nobles will not hear you but are gone to offer service to your enemy and wild amazement hurries up and down the little number of your doubtful friends
would not my lords return to me again after they heard young arthur was alive
they found him dead and cast into the streets an empty casket where the jewel of life by some damn d hand was robbed and ta en away
that villain hubert told me he did live
so on my soul he did for aught he knew
be great in act as you have been in thought let not the world see fear and sad distrust govern the motion of a kingly eye
be stirring as the time be fire with fire threaten the threat ner and outface the brow of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes that borrow their behaviours from the great grow great by your example and put on the dauntless spirit of resolution
away and glister like the god of war when he intendeth to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence
what shall they seek the lion in his den and fright him there and make him tremble there
o let it not be said
forage and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors and grapple with him ere he come so nigh
the legate of the pope hath been with me and i have made a happy peace with him and he hath promis d to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin
shall we upon the footing of our land send fair play orders and make compromise insinuation parley and base truce to arms invasive
shall a beardless boy a cock red silken wanton brave our fields and flesh his spirit in a warlike soil mocking the air with colours idly spread and find no check
let us my liege to arms
perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace or if he do let it at least be said they saw we had a purpose of defence
have thou the ordering of this present time
yet i know our party may well meet a prouder foe
the dauphin s camp at saint edmundsbury enter in arms lewis salisbury melun pembroke bigot and soldiers lewis
my lord melun let this be copied out and keep it safe for our remembrance return the precedent to these lords again that having our fair order written down both they and we perusing o er these notes may know wherefore we took the sacrament and keep our faiths firm and inviolable
upon our sides it never shall be broken
and noble dauphin albeit we swear a voluntary zeal and an unurg d faith to your proceedings yet believe me prince i am not glad that such a sore of time should seek a plaster by contemn d revolt and heal the inveterate canker of one wound by making many
o it grieves my soul that i must draw this metal from my side to be a widow maker
o and there where honourable rescue and defence cries out upon the name of salisbury
but such is the infection of the time that for the health and physic of our right we cannot deal but with the very hand of stern injustice and confused wrong
and is t not pity o my grieved friends
that we the sons and children of this isle were born to see so sad an hour as this wherein we step after a stranger march upon her gentle bosom and fill up her enemies ranks i must withdraw and weep upon the spot of this enforced cause to grace the gentry of a land remote and follow unacquainted colours here
o nation that thou couldst remove
that neptune s arms who clippeth thee about would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself and grapple thee unto a pagan shore where these two christian armies might combine the blood of malice in a vein of league and not to spend it so unneighbourly
a noble temper dost thou show in this and great affections wrestling in thy bosom doth make an earthquake of nobility
o what a noble combat hast thou fought between compulsion and a brave respect
let me wipe off this honourable dew that silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
my heart hath melted at a lady s tears being an ordinary inundation but this effusion of such manly drops this show r blown up by tempest of the soul startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz d than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven figur d quite o er with burning meteors
lift up thy brow renowned salisbury and with a great heart heave away this storm commend these waters to those baby eyes that never saw the giant world enrag d nor met with fortune other than at feasts full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep into the purse of rich prosperity as lewis himself
so nobles shall you all that knit your sinews to the strength of mine
enter pandulph and even there methinks an angel spake look where the holy legate comes apace to give us warrant from the hand of heaven and on our actions set the name of right with holy breath
the next is this king john hath reconcil d himself to rome his spirit is come in that so stood out against the holy church the great metropolis and see of rome
therefore thy threat ning colours now wind up and tame the savage spirit of wild war that like a lion fostered up at hand it may lie gently at the foot of peace and be no further harmful than in show
your grace shall pardon me i will not back i am too high born to be propertied to be a secondary at control or useful serving man and instrument to any sovereign state throughout the world
your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars between this chastis d kingdom and myself and brought in matter that should feed this fire and now tis far too huge to be blown out with that same weak wind which enkindled it
you taught me how to know the face of right acquainted me with interest to this land yea thrust this enterprise into my heart and come ye now to tell me john hath made his peace with rome
what is that peace to me
i by the honour of my marriage bed after young arthur claim this land for mine and now it is half conquer d must i back because that john hath made his peace with rome
what penny hath rome borne what men provided what munition sent to underprop this action
is t not i that undergo this charge
who else but i and such as to my claim are liable sweat in this business and maintain this war
have i not heard these islanders shout out vive le roi
as i have bank d their towns
have i not here the best cards for the game to will this easy match play d for a crown
and shall i now give o er the yielded set
no no on my soul it never shall be said
you look but on the outside of this work
outside or inside i will not return till my attempt so much be glorified as to my ample hope was promised before i drew this gallant head of war and cull d these fiery spirits from the world to outlook conquest and to will renown even in the jaws of danger and of death
trumpet sounds what lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
according to the fair play of the world let me have audience i am sent to speak
my holy lord of milan from the king i come to learn how you have dealt for him and as you answer i do know the scope and warrant limited unto my tongue
the dauphin is too wilful opposite and will not temporize with my entreaties he flatly says he ll not lay down his arms
by all the blood that ever fury breath d the youth says well
now hear our english king for thus his royalty doth speak in me
he is prepar d and reason too he should
this apish and unmannerly approach this harness d masque and unadvised revel this unhair d sauciness and boyish troops the king doth smile at and is well prepar d to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms from out the circle of his territories
that hand which had the strength even at your door
to cudgel you and make you take the hatch to dive like buckets in concealed wells to crouch in litter of your stable planks to lie like pawns lock d up in chests and trunks to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation s crow thinking this voice an armed englishman shall that victorious hand be feebled here that in your chambers gave you chastisement
know the gallant monarch is in arms and like an eagle o er his aery tow rs to souse annoyance that comes near his nest
and you degenerate you ingrate revolts you bloody neroes ripping up the womb of your dear mother england blush for shame for your own ladies and pale visag d maids like amazons come tripping after drums their thimbles into armed gauntlets change their needles to lances and their gentle hearts to fierce and bloody inclination
there end thy brave and turn thy face in peace we grant thou canst outscold us
fare thee well we hold our time too precious to be spent with such a brabbler
strike up the drums and let the tongue of war plead for our interest and our being here
indeed your drums being beaten will cry out and so shall you being beaten
do but start and echo with the clamour of thy drum and even at hand a drum is ready brac d that shall reverberate all as loud as thine sound but another and another shall as loud as thine rattle the welkin s ear and mock the deep mouth d thunder for at hand not trusting to this halting legate here whom he hath us d rather for sport than need is warlike john and in his forehead sits a bare ribb d death whose office is this day to feast upon whole thousands of the french
strike up our drums to find this danger out
and thou shalt find it dauphin do not doubt
enter king john and hubert king john
how goes the day with us
this fever that hath troubled me so long lies heavy on me
my lord your valiant kinsman faulconbridge desires your majesty to leave the field and send him word by me which way you go
tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there
be of good comfort for the great supply that was expected by the dauphin here are wreck d three nights ago on goodwin sands this news was brought to richard but even now
the french fight coldly and retire themselves
ay me this tyrant fever burns me up and will not let me welcome this good news
set on toward swinstead to my litter straight weakness possesseth me and i am faint
another part of the battlefield enter salisbury pembroke and bigot salisbury
i did not think the king so stor d with friends
up once again put spirit in the french if they miscarry we miscarry too
that misbegotten devil faulconbridge in spite of spite alone upholds the day
they say king john sore sick hath left the field
lead me to the revolts of england here
when we were happy we had other names
fly noble english you are bought and sold unthread the rude eye of rebellion and welcome home again discarded faith
seek out king john and fall before his feet for if the french be lords of this loud day he means to recompense the pains you take by cutting off your heads
thus hath he sworn and i with him and many moe with me upon the altar at saint edmundsbury even on that altar where we swore to you dear amity and everlasting love
have i not hideous death within my view retaining but a quantity of life which bleeds away even as a form of wax resolveth from his figure gainst the fire
what in the world should make me now deceive since i must lose the use of all deceit
why should i then be false since it is true that i must die here and live hence by truth
i say again if lewis do will the day he is forsworn if e er those eyes of yours behold another day break in the east but even this night whose black contagious breath already smokes about the burning crest of the old feeble and day wearied sun even this ill night your breathing shall expire paying the fine of rated treachery even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
if lewis by your assistance win the day
commend me to one hubert with your king the love of him and this respect besides for that my grandsire was an englishman awakes my conscience to confess all this
in lieu whereof i pray you bear me hence from forth the noise and rumour of the field where i may think the remnant of my thoughts in peace and part this body and my soul with contemplation and devout desires
we do believe thee and beshrew my soul but i do love the favour and the form of this most fair occasion by the which we will untread the steps of damned flight and like a bated and retired flood leaving our rankness and irregular course stoop low within those bounds we have o erlook d and calmly run on in obedience even to our ocean to great king john
my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence for i do see the cruel pangs of death right in thine eye
new flight and happy newness that intends old right
exeunt leading off melun scene 5
the french camp enter lewis and his train lewis
the sun of heaven methought was loath to set but stay d and made the western welkin blush when english measure backward their own ground in faint retire
o bravely came we off when with a volley of our needless shot after such bloody toil we bid good night and wound our tott ring colours clearly up last in the field and almost lords of it
where is my prince the dauphin
the count melun is slain the english lords by his persuasion are again fall n off and your supply which you have wish d so long are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands
i did not think to be so sad to night as this hath made me
who was he that said king john did fly an hour or two before the stumbling night did part our weary pow rs
whoever spoke it it is true my lord
keep good quarter and good care to night the day shall not be up so soon as i to try the fair adventure of to morrow
an open place wear swinstead abbey enter the bastard and hubert severally hubert
why may i not demand of thine affairs as well as thou of mine
i will upon all hazards well believe thou art my friend that know st my tongue so well
and if thou please thou mayst befriend me so much as to think i come one way of the plantagenets
thou and eyeless night have done me shame
brave soldier pardon me that any accent breaking from thy tongue should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear
come come sans compliment what news abroad
why here walk i in the black brow of night to find you out
brief then and what s the news
o my sweet sir news fitting to the night black fearful comfortless and horrible
show me the very wound of this ill news i am no woman i ll not swoon at it
the king i fear is poison d by a monk i left him almost speechless and broke out to acquaint you with this evil that you might the better arm you to the sudden time than if you had at leisure known of this
how did he take it who did taste to him
a monk i tell you a resolved villain whose bowels suddenly burst out
the king yet speaks and peradventure may recover
who didst thou leave to tend his majesty
the lords are all come back and brought prince henry in their company at whose request the king hath pardon d them and they are all about his majesty
withhold thine indignation mighty heaven and tempt us not to bear above our power
i ll tell thee hubert half my power this night passing these flats are taken by the tide these lincoln washes have devoured them myself well mounted hardly have escap d
conduct me to the king i doubt he will be dead or ere i come
the orchard at swinstead abbey enter prince henry salisbury and bigot prince henry
it is too late the life of all his blood is touch d corruptibly and his pure brain
which some suppose the soul s frail dwelling house doth by the idle comments that it makes foretell the ending of mortality
his highness yet doth speak and holds belief that being brought into the open air it would allay the burning quality of that fell poison which assaileth him
let him be brought into the orchard here
he is more patient than when you left him even now he sung
fierce extremes in their continuance will not feel themselves
death having prey d upon the outward parts leaves them invisible and his siege is now against the mind the which he pricks and wounds with many legions of strange fantasies which in their throng and press to that last hold confound themselves
tis strange that death should sing
i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan who chants a doleful hymn to his own death and from the organ pipe of frailty sings his soul and body to their lasting rest
be of good comfort prince for you are born to set a form upon that indigest which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
re enter bigot and attendants who bring in king john in a chair king john
ay marry now my soul hath elbow room it would not out at windows nor at doors
there is so hot a summer in my bosom that all my bowels crumble up to dust
i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen upon a parchment and against this fire do i shrink up
dead forsook cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw nor let my kingdom s rivers take their course through my burn d bosom nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips and comfort me with cold
i do not ask you much i beg cold comfort and you are so strait and so ingrateful you deny me that
o that there were some virtue in my tears that might relieve you
the salt in them is hot
within me is a hell and there the poison is as a fiend confin d to tyrannize on unreprievable condemned blood
o i am scalded with my violent motion and spleen of speed to see your majesty
o cousin thou art come to set mine eye
the tackle of my heart is crack d and burnt and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turned to one thread one little hair my heart hath one poor string to stay it by which holds but till thy news be uttered and then all this thou seest is but a clod and module of confounded royalty
the dauphin is preparing hitherward where god he knows how we shall answer him for in a night the best part of my pow r as i upon advantage did remove were in the washes all unwarily devoured by the unexpected flood
you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
but now a king now thus
even so must i run on and even so stop
what surety of the world what hope what stay when this was now a king and now is clay
i do but stay behind to do the office for thee of revenge and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven as it on earth hath been thy servant still
now now you stars that move in your right spheres where be your pow rs
show now your mended faiths and instantly return with me again to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land
straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought the dauphin rages at our very heels
it seems you know not then so much as we the cardinal pandulph is within at rest who half an hour since came from the dauphin and brings from him such offers of our peace as we with honour and respect may take with purpose presently to leave this war
he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinewed to our defence
nay tis in a manner done already for many carriages he hath dispatch d to the sea side and put his cause and quarrel to the disposing of the cardinal with whom yourself myself and other lords if you think meet this afternoon will post to consummate this business happily
and you my noble prince with other princes that may best be spar d shall wait upon your father s funeral
at worcester must his body be interr d for so he will d it
thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land
to whom with all submission on my knee i do bequeath my faithful services and true subjection everlastingly
and the like tender of our love we make to rest without a spot for evermore
i have a kind soul that would give you thanks and knows not how to do it but with tears
o let us pay the time but needful woe since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
this england never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when it first did help to wound itself
now these her princes are come home again come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them
nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true

home you idle creatures get you home
what know you not being mechanical you ought not walk upon a labouring day without the sign of your profession
where is thy leather apron and thy rule
what dost thou with thy best apparel on
you sir what trade are you
truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler
a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you
thou art a cobbler art thou
truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters but withal i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger i recover them
as proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork
but wherefore art not in thy shop today
why dost thou lead these men about the streets
truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work
but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome knew you not pompey
many a time and oft have you climb’d up to walls and battlements to towers and windows yea to chimney tops your infants in your arms and there have sat the livelong day with patient expectation to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
and when you saw his chariot but appear have you not made an universal shout that tiber trembled underneath her banks to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores
and do you now put on your best attire
and do you now cull out a holiday
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompey’s blood
run to your houses fall upon your knees pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude
go go good countrymen and for this fault assemble all the poor men of your sort draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all
exeunt citizens see whether their basest metal be not mov’d they vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness
go you down that way towards the capitol this way will i disrobe the images if you do find them deck’d with ceremonies
you know it is the feast of lupercal
it is no matter let no images be hung with caesar’s trophies
i’ll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too where you perceive them thick
these growing feathers pluck’d from caesar’s wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness
enter in procession with music caesar antony for the course calphurnia portia decius cicero brutus cassius and casca a great crowd following among them a soothsayer
stand you directly in antonius’ way when he doth run his course
forget not in your speed antonius to touch calphurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse
when caesar says “do this ” it is perform’d
set on and leave no ceremony out
bid every noise be still peace yet again
who is it in the press that calls on me
i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry “caesar”
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march
set him before me let me see his face
fellow come from the throng look upon caesar
what say’st thou to me now
he is a dreamer let us leave him
exeunt all but brutus and cassius cassius
will you go see the order of the course
i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony
let me not hinder cassius your desires i’ll leave you
brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have
you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you
cassius be not deceived if i have veil’d my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself
vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men
then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
tell me good brutus can you see your face
no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other thing
’tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow
i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age’s yoke have wish’d that noble brutus had his eyes
into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me
therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of
and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous
i do fear the people choose caesar for their king
then must i think you would not have it so
i would not cassius yet i love him well but wherefore do you hold me here so long
what is it that you would impart to me
if it be aught toward the general good set honour in one eye and death i’ the other and i will look on both indifferently for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honour more than i fear death
i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favour
well honour is the subject of my story
i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself
i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter’s cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me “dar’st thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point ” upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did
the torrent roar’d and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy
but ere we could arrive the point propos’d caesar cried “help me cassius or i sink ” i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar
and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him
he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake ’tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre
i did hear him groan ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried “give me some drink titinius ” as a sick girl
ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone
i do believe that these applauses are for some new honours that are heap’d on caesar
why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves
men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
“brutus” and “caesar” what should be in that “caesar”
why should that name be sounded more than yours
write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with ’em “brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “caesar ” now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great
rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
when went there by an age since the great flood but it was fam’d with more than with one man
when could they say till now that talk’d of rome that her wide walls encompass’d but one man
now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man
o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brook’d th’ eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king
that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter
for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further mov’d
what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things
till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus
the games are done and caesar is returning
as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today
but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesar’s brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calphurnia’s cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being cross’d in conference by some senators
casca will tell us what the matter is
let me have men about me that are fat sleek headed men and such as sleep a nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous
fear him not caesar he’s not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given
but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius
he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men
he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music
seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit that could be mov’d to smile at anything
such men as he be never at heart’s ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous
i rather tell thee what is to be fear’d than what i fear for always i am caesar
come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou think’st of him
you pull’d me by the cloak would you speak with me
ay casca tell us what hath chanc’d today that caesar looks so sad
why you were with him were you not
i should not then ask casca what had chanc’d
why there was a crown offer’d him and being offer’d him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting
what was the second noise for
they shouted thrice what was the last cry for
was the crown offer’d him thrice
ay marry was’t and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbours shouted
tell us the manner of it gentle casca
i can as well be hang’d as tell the manner of it it was mere foolery i did not mark it
i saw mark antony offer him a crown yet ’twas not a crown neither ’twas one of these coronets and as i told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it
then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it
and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refus’d it the rabblement hooted and clapp’d their chopt hands and threw up their sweaty night caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refus’d the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swooned and fell down at it
and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air
he fell down in the market place and foam’d at mouth and was speechless
’tis very like he hath the falling sickness
no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness
i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down
if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man
what said he when he came unto himself
marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he pluck’d me ope his doublet and offer’d them his throat to cut
and i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues
when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desir’d their worships to think it was his infirmity
three or four wenches where i stood cried “alas good soul ” and forgave him with all their hearts
but there’s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabb’d their mothers they would have done no less
and after that he came thus sad away
nay and i tell you that i’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again
but those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me
i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesar’s images are put to silence
there was more foolery yet if i could remember it
will you sup with me tonight casca
will you dine with me tomorrow
ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
he was quick mettle when he went to school
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite
for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you
i will do so till then think of the world
exit brutus well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honourable metal may be wrought from that it is dispos’d therefore ’tis meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduc’d
caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus
if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me
i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar’s ambition shall be glanced at
and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure
enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero
good even casca brought you caesar home
why are you breathless and why stare you so
are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm
o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have riv’d the knotty oaks and i have seen th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire
either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction
why saw you anything more wonderful
a common slave you’d know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches join’d and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d
besides i ha’ not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me
and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace hooting and shrieking
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say “these are their reasons they are natural” for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon
indeed it is a strange disposed time
but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves
comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow
he doth for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow
goodnight then casca this disturbed sky is not to walk in
a very pleasing night to honest men
who ever knew the heavens menace so
those that have known the earth so full of faults
for my part i have walk’d about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bar’d my bosom to the thunder stone and when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us
you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not
you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and pre formed faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state
now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are
’tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors but woe the while
our fathers’ minds are dead and we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy
i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself
if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure
so can i so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity
and why should caesar be a tyrant then
i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep he were no lion were not romans hinds
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws
what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar
but o grief where hast thou led me
i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made but i am arm’d and dangers are to me indifferent
you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering tell tale
hold my hand be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest
now know you casca i have mov’d already some certain of the noblest minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honourable dangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompey’s porch for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favour’s like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible
stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
’tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend
no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts
am i not stay’d for cinna
what a fearful night is this
there’s two or three of us have seen strange sights
o cassius if you could but win the noble brutus to our party— cassius
good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetor’s chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus’ statue all this done repair to pompey’s porch where you shall find us
is decius brutus and trebonius there
all but metellus cimber and he’s gone to seek you at your house
well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me
that done repair to pompey’s theatre
exit cinna come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours
o he sits high in all the people’s hearts
and that which would appear offence in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited
let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him
exeunt act ii scene i rome
i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day —lucius i say
i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
get me a taper in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here
it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general
he would be crown’d how that might change his nature there’s the question
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking
crown him —that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with
th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections sway’d more than his reason
but ’tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambition’s ladder whereto the climber upward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend
so caesar may then lest he may prevent
and since the quarrel will bear no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpent’s egg which hatch’d would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell
the taper burneth in your closet sir
searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seal’d up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed
get you to bed again it is not day
is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
look in the calendar and bring me word
the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them
opens the letter and reads brutus thou sleep’st awake and see thyself
shall rome c speak strike redress “brutus thou sleep’st awake ” such instigations have been often dropp’d where i have took them up
“shall rome c ” thus must i piece it out shall rome stand under one man’s awe
my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was call’d a king
“speak strike redress ” am i entreated to speak and strike
o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus
sir march is wasted fifteen days
go to the gate somebody knocks
exit lucius since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept
between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection
sir ’tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you
no sir there are moe with him
no sir their hats are pluck’d about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favour
exit lucius they are the faction
o conspiracy sham’st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free
o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage
seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention
enter cassius casca decius cinna metellus cimber and trebonius
i think we are too bold upon your rest good morrow brutus do we trouble you
i have been up this hour awake all night
know i these men that come along with you
yes every man of them and no man here but honours you and everyone doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you
this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night
here lies the east doth not the day break here
o pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day
you shall confess that you are both deceiv’d
here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year
some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here
give me your hands all over one by one
and let us swear our resolution
if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the time’s abuse— if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed
so let high sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery
but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valour the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress
what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engag’d that this shall be or we will fall for it
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath pass’d from him
i think he will stand very strong with us
let us not leave him out
o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men’s voices to commend our deeds
it shall be said his judgment rul’d our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity
o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin
shall no man else be touch’d but only caesar
i think it is not meet mark antony so well belov’d of caesar should outlive caesar we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together
our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar
let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood
o that we then could come by caesar’s spirit and not dismember caesar
but alas caesar must bleed for it
and gentle friends let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide ’em
this shall mark our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be call’d purgers not murderers
and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesar’s arm when caesar’s head is off
yet i fear him for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar— brutus
alas good cassius do not think of him if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar
and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company
there is no fear in him let him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustom’d terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today
never fear that if he be so resolved i can o’ersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betray’d with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers
but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered
let me work for i can give his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol
nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
by the eighth hour is that the uttermost
be that the uttermost and fail not then
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you have thought of him
now good metellus go along by him he loves me well and i have given him reason send him but hither and i’ll fashion him
and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans
good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy
and so good morrow to you everyone
it is no matter enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleep’st so sound
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning
y’ have ungently brutus stole from my bed and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walk’d about musing and sighing with your arms across and when i ask’d you what the matter was you star’d upon me with ungentle looks
i urg’d you further then you scratch’d your head and too impatiently stamp’d with your foot yet i insisted yet you answer’d not but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you
so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem’d too much enkindled and withal hoping it was but an effect of humour which sometime hath his hour with every man
it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevail’d on your condition i should not know you brutus
dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief
i am not well in health and that is all
brutus is wise and were he not in health he would embrace the means to come by it
is brutus sick and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humours of the dank morning
what is brutus sick and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness
no my brutus you have some sick offence within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by my once commended beauty by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one that you unfold to me your self your half why you are heavy and what men tonight have had resort to you for here have been some six or seven who did hide their faces even from darkness
i should not need if you were gentle brutus
within the bond of marriage tell me brutus is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you
am i your self but as it were in sort or limitation to keep with you at meals comfort your bed and talk to you sometimes
dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure
if it be no more portia is brutus’ harlot not his wife
you are my true and honourable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart
if this were true then should i know this secret
i grant i am a woman but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife i grant i am a woman but withal a woman well reputed cato’s daughter
think you i am no stronger than my sex being so father’d and so husbanded
tell me your counsels i will not disclose ’em
i have made strong proof of my constancy giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh can i bear that with patience and not my husband’s secrets
o ye gods render me worthy of this noble wife
portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart
all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows
exit portia enter lucius with ligarius
here is a sick man that would speak with you
caius ligarius that metellus spake of
vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief
i am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honour
such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it
by all the gods that romans bow before i here discard my sickness
brave son derived from honourable loins
thou like an exorcist hast conjur’d up my mortified spirit
now bid me run and i will strive with things impossible yea get the better of them
a piece of work that will make sick men whole
but are not some whole that we must make sick
what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done
set on your foot and with a heart new fir’d i follow you to do i know not what but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on
nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out “help ho
they murder caesar ” who’s within
go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success
you shall not stir out of your house today
the things that threaten’d me ne’er look’d but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished
caesar i never stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me
there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawn’d and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them
what can be avoided whose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods
yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar
when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once
of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come
they would not have you to stir forth today
plucking the entrails of an offering forth they could not find a heart within the beast
the gods do this in shame of cowardice caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear
danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he
we are two lions litter’d in one day and i the elder and more terrible and caesar shall go forth
alas my lord your wisdom is consum’d in confidence
do not go forth today call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own
we’ll send mark antony to the senate house and he shall say you are not well today
let me upon my knee prevail in this
mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humour i will stay at home
here’s decius brutus he shall tell them so
i come to fetch you to the senate house
and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today
cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today
have i in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far to be afeard to tell grey beards the truth
decius go tell them caesar will not come
most mighty caesar let me know some cause lest i be laugh’d at when i tell them so
the cause is in my will i will not come
that is enough to satisfy the senate
but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know calphurnia here my wife stays me at home
she dreamt tonight she saw my statue which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath begg’d that i will stay at home today
this dream is all amiss interpreted it was a vision fair and fortunate
your statue spouting blood in many pipes in which so many smiling romans bath’d signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood and that great men shall press for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
this by calphurnia’s dream is signified
and this way have you well expounded it
i have when you have heard what i can say and know it now
the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
if you shall send them word you will not come their minds may change
besides it were a mock apt to be render’d for someone to say “break up the senate till another time when caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams ” if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper “lo caesar is afraid”
pardon me caesar for my dear dear love to your proceeding bids me tell you this and reason to my love is liable
how foolish do your fears seem now calphurnia
i am ashamed i did yield to them
give me my robe for i will go
enter brutus ligarius metellus casca trebonius cinna and publius
and look where publius is come to fetch me
what brutus are you stirr’d so early too
caius ligarius caesar was ne’er so much your enemy as that same ague which hath made you lean
i thank you for your pains and courtesy
antony that revels long a nights is notwithstanding up
i am to blame to be thus waited for
now cinna now metellus what trebonius
i have an hour’s talk in store for you remember that you call on me today be near me that i may remember you
aside and so near will i be that your best friends shall wish i had been further
good friends go in and taste some wine with me and we like friends will straightway go together
aside that every like is not the same o caesar the heart of brutus yearns to think upon
“caesar beware of brutus take heed of cassius come not near casca have an eye to cinna trust not trebonius mark well metellus cimber decius brutus loves thee not thou hast wrong’d caius ligarius
there is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against caesar
if thou be’st not immortal look about you security gives way to conspiracy
thy lover artemidorus ” here will i stand till caesar pass along and as a suitor will i give him this
my heart laments that virtue cannot live out of the teeth of emulation
if thou read this o caesar thou mayest live if not the fates with traitors do contrive
another part of the same street before the house of brutus
i pr’ythee boy run to the senate house stay not to answer me but get thee gone
i would have had thee there and here again ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
aside o constancy be strong upon my side set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue
i have a man’s mind but a woman’s might
how hard it is for women to keep counsel
run to the capitol and nothing else
and so return to you and nothing else
yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well for he went sickly forth and take good note what caesar doth what suitors press to him
hark boy what noise is that
i heard a bustling rumour like a fray and the wind brings it from the capitol
come hither fellow which way hast thou been
at mine own house good lady
is caesar yet gone to the capitol
i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol
thou hast some suit to caesar hast thou not
that i have lady if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me i shall beseech him to befriend himself
why know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him
none that i know will be much that i fear may chance
the throng that follows caesar at the heels of senators of praetors common suitors will crowd a feeble man almost to death i’ll get me to a place more void and there speak to great caesar as he comes along
aside ay me how weak a thing the heart of woman is
o brutus the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
brutus hath a suit that caesar will not grant
run lucius and commend me to my lord say i am merry come to me again and bring me word what he doth say to thee
exeunt act iii scene i rome
before the capitol the senate sitting
a crowd of people in the street leading to the capitol
enter caesar brutus cassius casca decius metellus trebonius cinna antony lepidus artemidorus publius popilius and the soothsayer
the ides of march are come
trebonius doth desire you to o’er read at your best leisure this his humble suit
o caesar read mine first for mine’s a suit that touches caesar nearer
what touches us ourself shall be last serv’d
what urge you your petitions in the street
caesar enters the capitol the rest following
i wish your enterprise today may thrive
he wish’d today our enterprise might thrive
i fear our purpose is discovered
look how he makes to caesar mark him
casca be sudden for we fear prevention
if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself
cassius be constant popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
trebonius knows his time for look you brutus he draws mark antony out of the way
caesar and the senators take their seats decius
let him go and presently prefer his suit to caesar
he is address’d press near and second him
casca you are the first that rears your hand
what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress
most high most mighty and most puissant caesar metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart
these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn pre ordinance and first decree into the law of children
be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thaw’d from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words low crooked curtsies and base spaniel fawning
thy brother by decree is banished if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
know caesar dost not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied
is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesar’s ear for the repealing of my banish’d brother
i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal
pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
i could be well mov’d if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose true fix’d and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament
the skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but there’s but one in all doth hold his place
so in the world ’tis furnish’d well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshak’d of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banish’d and constant do remain to keep him so
casca stabs caesar in the neck
caesar catches hold of his arm
he is then stabbed by several other conspirators and at last by marcus brutus caesar
et tu brute —then fall caesar
the senators and people retire in confusion cinna
run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
some to the common pulpits and cry out “liberty freedom and enfranchisement ” brutus
people and senators be not affrighted
fly not stand still ambition’s debt is paid
here quite confounded with this mutiny
stand fast together lest some friend of caesar’s should chance— brutus
there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else
and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief
do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers
men wives and children stare cry out and run as it were doomsday
fates we will know your pleasures
that we shall die we know ’tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon
why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death
grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesar’s friends that have abridg’d his time of fearing death
stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesar’s blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the market place and waving our red weapons o’er our heads let’s all cry “peace freedom and liberty ” cassius
stoop then and wash how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown
how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompey’s basis lies along no worthier than the dust
so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be call’d the men that gave their country liberty
brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
thus brutus did my master bid me kneel thus did mark antony bid me fall down and being prostrate thus he bade me say brutus is noble wise valiant and honest caesar was mighty bold royal and loving say i love brutus and i honour him say i fear’d caesar honour’d him and lov’d him
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolv’d how caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith
thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse
tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honour depart untouch’d
i know that we shall have him well to friend
i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose
are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure
i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesar’s death’s hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world
i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure
live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die
no place will please me so no means of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age
o antony beg not your death of us
though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done
our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome— as fire drives out fire so pity pity— hath done this deed on caesar
for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers’ temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
your voice shall be as strong as any man’s in the disposing of new dignities
only be patient till we have appeas’d the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded
i doubt not of your wisdom
let each man render me his bloody hand
first marcus brutus will i shake with you next caius cassius do i take your hand
now decius brutus yours now yours metellus yours cinna and my valiant casca yours though last not least in love yours good trebonius
gentlemen all—alas what shall i say
my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer
that i did love thee caesar o ’tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes most noble in the presence of thy corse
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies
here wast thou bay’d brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand sign’d in thy spoil and crimson’d in thy lethe
o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee
how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie
pardon me caius cassius the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty
i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us
will you be prick’d in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you
therefore i took your hands but was indeed sway’d from the point by looking down on caesar
friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous
or else were this a savage spectacle
our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied
that’s all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the market place and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral
aside to brutus you know not what you do
do not consent that antony speak in his funeral
know you how much the people may be mov’d by that which he will utter
aside to cassius by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesar’s death
what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rights and lawful ceremonies
it shall advantage more than do us wrong
aside to brutus i know not what may fall i like it not
mark antony here take you caesar’s body
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you do’t by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended
be it so i do desire no more
prepare the body then and follow us
o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
you serve octavius caesar do you not
caesar did write for him to come to rome
he did receive his letters and is coming and bid me say to you by word of mouth — seeing the body o caesar
thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water
he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome
post back with speed and tell him what hath chanc’d
here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet
hie hence and tell him so
yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the market place there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things
exeunt with caesar’s body scene ii
enter brutus and goes into the pulpit and cassius with a throng of citizens
we will be satisfied let us be satisfied
then follow me and give me audience friends
cassius go you into the other street and part the numbers
those that will hear me speak let ’em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be rendered of caesar’s death
i will hear cassius and compare their reasons when severally we hear them rendered
exit cassius with some of the citizens
brutus goes into the rostrum third citizen
the noble brutus is ascended silence
romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear
believe me for mine honour and have respect to mine honour that you may believe
censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesar’s to him i say that brutus’ love to caesar was no less than his
if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more
had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all free men
as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him
there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honour for his valour and death for his ambition
who is here so base that would be a bondman
if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so rude that would not be a roman
if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so vile that will not love his country
if any speak for him have i offended
i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus
the question of his death is enroll’d in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforc’d for which he suffered death
enter antony and others with caesar’s body
here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not
with this i depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death
bring him with triumph home unto his house
give him a statue with his ancestors
caesar’s better parts shall be crown’d in brutus
we’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamours
good countrymen let me depart alone and for my sake stay here with antony
do grace to caesar’s corpse and grace his speech tending to caesar’s glories which mark antony by our permission is allow’d to make
i do entreat you not a man depart save i alone till antony have spoke
and let us hear mark antony
let him go up into the public chair
for brutus’ sake i am beholding to you
what does he say of brutus
he says for brutus’ sake he finds himself beholding to us all
’twere best he speak no harm of brutus here
we are blest that rome is rid of him
let us hear what antony can say
friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him
the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar
the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious
if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answer’d it
here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speak in caesar’s funeral
he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man
he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill did this in caesar seem ambitious
when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man
you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse
yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know
you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason
my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me
methinks there is much reason in his sayings
if thou consider rightly of the matter caesar has had great wrong
i fear there will a worse come in his place
he would not take the crown therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious
if it be found so some will dear abide it
poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
there’s not a nobler man in rome than antony
now mark him he begins again to speak
but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence
if i were dispos’d to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men
i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honourable men
but here’s a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet ’tis his will let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesar’s wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue
have patience gentle friends i must not read it
it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad
’tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it
we’ll hear it antony you shall read us the will caesar’s will
i have o’ershot myself to tell you of it
i fear i wrong the honourable men whose daggers have stabb’d caesar i do fear it
you will compel me then to read the will
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will
and will you give me leave
stand from the hearse stand from the body
room for antony most noble antony
nay press not so upon me stand far off
if you have tears prepare to shed them now
you all do know this mantle
i remember the first time ever caesar put it on ’twas on a summer’s evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii
look in this place ran cassius’ dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the well beloved brutus stabb’d and as he pluck’d his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar follow’d it as rushing out of doors to be resolv’d if brutus so unkindly knock’d or no for brutus as you know was caesar’s angel
judge o you gods how dearly caesar lov’d him
this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors’ arms quite vanquish’d him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompey’s statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
o what a fall was there my countrymen
then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourish’d over us
o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity
kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesar’s vesture wounded
look you here here is himself marr’d as you see with traitors
revenge —about —seek —burn —fire —kill —slay —let not a traitor live
we’ll hear him we’ll follow him we’ll die with him
good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny
they that have done this deed are honourable
what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it
they’re wise and honourable and will no doubt with reasons answer you
i come not friends to steal away your hearts
i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him
for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir men’s blood
i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesar’s wounds poor poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me
but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny
we’ll burn the house of brutus
yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
why friends you go to do you know not what
wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves
alas you know not i must tell you then
you have forgot the will i told you of
most true the will —let’s stay and hear the will
here is the will and under caesar’s seal
to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventy five drachmas
moreover he hath left you all his walks his private arbors and new planted orchards on this side tiber he hath left them you and to your heirs forever common pleasures to walk abroad and recreate yourselves
we’ll burn his body in the holy place and with the brands fire the traitors’ houses
exeunt citizens with the body antony
mischief thou art afoot take thou what course thou wilt
sir octavius is already come to rome
he and lepidus are at caesar’s house
and thither will i straight to visit him
fortune is merry and in this mood will give us anything
i heard him say brutus and cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of rome
belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them
enter cinna the poet and after him the citizens
i dreamt tonight that i did feast with caesar and things unluckily charge my fantasy
i have no will to wander forth of doors yet something leads me forth
are you a married man or a bachelor
ay and truly you were best
am i a married man or a bachelor
then to answer every man directly and briefly wisely and truly
wisely i say i am a bachelor
that’s as much as to say they are fools that marry you’ll bear me a bang for that i fear
directly i am going to caesar’s funeral
as a friend or an enemy
briefly i dwell by the capitol
i am cinna the poet i am cinna the poet
tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses
i am not cinna the conspirator
it is no matter his name’s cinna pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going
to brutus’ to cassius’ burn all
some to decius’ house and some to casca’s some to ligarius’
exeunt act iv scene i rome
enter antony octavius and lepidus seated at a table
these many then shall die their names are prick’d
your brother too must die consent you lepidus
upon condition publius shall not live who is your sister’s son mark antony
he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
but lepidus go you to caesar’s house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies
what shall i find you here
or here or at the capitol
this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands
is it fit the three fold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it
so you thought him and took his voice who should be prick’d to die in our black sentence and proscription
octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honours on this man to ease ourselves of divers sland’rous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons
you may do your will but he’s a tried and valiant soldier
so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender
it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion govern’d by my spirit
and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and train’d and bid go forth a barren spirited fellow one that feeds on objects arts and imitations which out of use and stal’d by other men begin his fashion
do not talk of him but as a property
and now octavius listen great things
brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head
therefore let our alliance be combin’d our best friends made our means stretch’d and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclos’d and open perils surest answered
let us do so for we are at the stake and bay’d about with many enemies and some that smile have in their hearts i fear millions of mischiefs
before brutus’ tent in the camp near sardis
enter brutus lucilius titinius and soldiers pindarus meeting them lucius at some distance
he is at hand and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master
pindarus gives a letter to brutus brutus
your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied
i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear such as he is full of regard and honour
a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolv’d
with courtesy and with respect enough but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath us’d of old
thou hast describ’d a hot friend cooling
ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle low march within but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial
they meant this night in sardis to be quarter’d the greater part the horse in general are come with cassius
march gently on to meet him
most noble brother you have done me wrong
judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
and if not so how should i wrong a brother
brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them— brutus
speak your griefs softly i do know you well
before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle
bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience
pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground
lucilius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference
lucius and titinius guard our door
that you have wrong’d me doth appear in this you have condemn’d and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man were slighted off
you wrong’d yourself to write in such a case
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offence should bear his comment
let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemn’d to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers
you know that you are brutus that speak this or by the gods this speech were else your last
the name of cassius honours this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
remember march the ides of march remember did not great julius bleed for justice’ sake
what villain touch’d his body that did stab and not for justice
shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honours for so much trash as may be grasped thus
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman
brutus bait not me i’ll not endure it
you forget yourself to hedge me in
i am a soldier i older in practice abler than yourself to make conditions
go to you are not cassius
urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
hear me for i will speak
must i give way and room to your rash choler
shall i be frighted when a madman stares
ay more fret till your proud heart break go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble
must i stand and crouch under your testy humour
by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth i’ll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish
you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well
for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men
you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
i said an elder soldier not a better did i say better
if you did i care not
when caesar liv’d he durst not thus have mov’d me
you durst not so have tempted him
for your life you durst not
do not presume too much upon my love
i may do that i shall be sorry for
you have done that you should be sorry for
there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am arm’d so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not
i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection
i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me was that done like cassius
should i have answer’d caius cassius so
when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces
he was but a fool that brought my answer back
a friend should bear his friend’s infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are
i do not till you practise them on me
i do not like your faults
a friendly eye could never see such faults
a flatterer’s would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus
come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is a weary of the world hated by one he loves brav’d by his brother check’d like a bondman all his faults observ’d set in a note book learn’d and conn’d by rote to cast into my teeth
o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes
there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutus’ mine richer than gold if that thou be’st a roman take it forth
i that denied thee gold will give my heart strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius
be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonour shall be humour
o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again
hath cassius liv’d to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood ill temper’d vexeth him
when i spoke that i was ill temper’d too
have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humour which my mother gave me makes me forgetful
yes cassius and from henceforth when you are over earnest with your brutus he’ll think your mother chides and leave you so
enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius
within let me go in to see the generals there is some grudge between ’em ’tis not meet they be alone
within you shall not come to them
within nothing but death shall stay me
love and be friends as two such men should be for i have seen more years i’m sure than ye
how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
bear with him brutus ’tis his fashion
i’ll know his humour when he knows his time
what should the wars do with these jigging fools
lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight
and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us
i did not think you could have been so angry
o cassius i am sick of many griefs
of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils
how ’scap’d i killing when i cross’d you so
impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong for with her death that tidings came
with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallow’d fire
enter lucius with wine and a taper
give me a bowl of wine
in this i bury all unkindness cassius
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
fill lucius till the wine o’erswell the cup
i cannot drink too much of brutus’ love
drinks exit lucius enter titinius and messala
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities
messala i have here received letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
that by proscription and bills of outlawry octavius antony and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators
therein our letters do not well agree
mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one
cicero is dead and by that order of proscription
had you your letters from your wife my lord
nor nothing in your letters writ of her
hear you aught of her in yours
now as you are a roman tell me true
then like a roman bear the truth i tell for certain she is dead and by strange manner
with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now
even so great men great losses should endure
i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so
what do you think of marching to philippi presently
i do not think it good
this it is ’tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offence whilst we lying still are full of rest defence and nimbleness
good reasons must of force give place to better
the people ’twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudg’d us contribution
the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refresh’d new added and encourag’d from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back
you must note besides that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brim full our cause is ripe
the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries
on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures
then with your will go on we’ll along ourselves and meet them at philippi
the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest
there is no more to say
good night early tomorrow will we rise and hence
exit lucius farewell now good messala
noble noble cassius good night and good repose
this was an ill beginning of the night
never come such division ’tween our souls
exeunt cassius titinius and messala give me the gown
poor knave i blame thee not thou art o’er watch’d
call claudius and some other of my men i’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent
i pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius
so please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
i will not have it so lie down good sirs it may be i shall otherwise bethink me
look lucius here’s the book i sought for so i put it in the pocket of my gown
i was sure your lordship did not give it me
bear with me good boy i am much forgetful
canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile and touch thy instrument a strain or two
ay my lord an’t please you
i trouble thee too much but thou art willing
i should not urge thy duty past thy might i know young bloods look for a time of rest
i have slept my lord already
it was well done and thou shalt sleep again i will not hold thee long
if i do live i will be good to thee
lucius plays and sings till he falls asleep this is a sleepy tune
o murd’rous slumber layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music
gentle knave good night i will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
if thou dost nod thou break’st thy instrument i’ll take it from thee and good boy good night
let me see let me see is not the leaf turn’d down where i left reading
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition
art thou some god some angel or some devil that mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare
speak to me what thou art
to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi
well then i shall see thee again
why i will see thee at philippi then
ghost vanishes now i have taken heart thou vanishest
ill spirit i would hold more talk with thee
the strings my lord are false
he thinks he still is at his instrument
didst thou dream lucius that thou so criedst out
my lord i do not know that i did cry
why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
no my lord i saw nothing
go and commend me to my brother cassius bid him set on his powers betimes before and we will follow
it shall be done my lord
enter octavius antony and their army
now antony our hopes are answered
you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions
it proves not so their battles are at hand they mean to warn us at philippi here answering before we do demand of them
tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it
they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but ’tis not so
the enemy comes on in gallant show their bloody sign of battle is hung out and something to be done immediately
octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field
why do you cross me in this exigent
i do not cross you but i will do so
enter brutus cassius and their army lucilius titinius messala and others
they stand and would have parley
stand fast titinius we must out and talk
mark antony shall we give sign of battle
no caesar we will answer on their charge
make forth the generals would have some words
words before blows is it so countrymen
not that we love words better as you do
good words are better than bad strokes octavius
in your bad strokes brutus you give good words witness the hole you made in caesar’s heart crying “long live
antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless
o yes and soundless too for you have stol’n their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting
villains you did not so when your vile daggers hack’d one another in the sides of caesar you show’d your teeth like apes and fawn’d like hounds and bow’d like bondmen kissing caesar’s feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind struck caesar on the neck
this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have rul’d
if arguing makes us sweat the proof of it will turn to redder drops
look i draw a sword against conspirators
when think you that the sword goes up again
never till caesar’s three and thirty wounds be well aveng’d or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
caesar thou canst not die by traitors’ hands unless thou bring’st them with thee
i was not born to die on brutus’ sword
o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honourable
a peevish school boy worthless of such honour join’d with a masker and a reveller
defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
if you dare fight today come to the field if not when you have stomachs
exeunt octavius antony and their army cassius
why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
the storm is up and all is on the hazard
brutus and lucilius talk apart cassius
messala this is my birth day as this very day was cassius born
give me thy hand messala be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compell’d to set upon one battle all our liberties
you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion
now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage
coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perch’d gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands who to philippi here consorted us
this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly o’er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost
i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolv’d to meet all perils very constantly
now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain let’s reason with the worst that may befall
if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together what are you then determined to do
even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below
then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome
no cassius no think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind
but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun and whether we shall meet again i know not
for ever and for ever farewell cassius
if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made
for ever and for ever farewell brutus
if we do meet again we’ll smile indeed if not ’tis true this parting was well made
o that a man might know the end of this day’s business ere it come
but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known
ride ride messala ride and give these bills unto the legions on the other side
loud alarum let them set on at once for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius’ wing and sudden push gives them the overthrow
ride ride messala let them all come down
o look titinius look the villains fly
myself have to mine own turn’d enemy this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him
o cassius brutus gave the word too early who having some advantage on octavius took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil whilst we by antony are all enclos’d
fly further off my lord fly further off mark antony is in your tents my lord
fly therefore noble cassius fly far off
look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire
titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assur’d whether yond troops are friend or enemy
i will be here again even with a thought
go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick
regard titinius and tell me what thou notest about the field
pindarus goes up this day i breathed first
time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end
my life is run his compass
above titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen that make to him on the spur yet he spurs on
now they are almost on him
o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend ta’en before my face
in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it
now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesar’s bowels search this bosom
here take thou the hilts and when my face is cover’d as ’tis now guide thou the sword —caesar thou art reveng’d even with the sword that kill’d thee
so i am free yet would not so have been durst i have done my will
far from this country pindarus shall run where never roman shall take note of him
it is but change titinius for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus’ power as cassius’ legions are by antony
these tidings would well comfort cassius
all disconsolate with pindarus his bondman on this hill
is not that he that lies upon the ground
he lies not like the living
no this was he messala but cassius is no more
o setting sun as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night so in his red blood cassius’ day is set
the sun of rome is set
our day is gone clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
mistrust of my success hath done this deed
mistrust of good success hath done this deed
why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men the things that are not
o error soon conceiv’d thou never com’st unto a happy birth but kill’st the mother that engender’d thee
seek him titinius whilst i go to meet the noble brutus thrusting this report into his ears
i may say thrusting it for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight
hie you messala and i will seek for pindarus the while
exit messala why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
did i not meet thy friends
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee
didst thou not hear their shouts
but hold thee take this garland on thy brow thy brutus bid me give it thee and i will do his bidding
brutus come apace and see how i regarded caius cassius
come cassius’ sword and find titinius’ heart
enter brutus messala young cato strato volumnius and lucilius
where where messala doth his body lie
lo yonder and titinius mourning it
o julius caesar thou art mighty yet
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails
look whether he have not crown’d dead cassius
are yet two romans living such as these
the last of all the romans fare thee well
it is impossible that ever rome should breed thy fellow
friends i owe more tears to this dead man than you shall see me pay
i shall find time cassius i shall find time
come therefore and to thassos send his body
his funerals shall not be in our camp lest it discomfort us
lucilius come and come young cato let us to the field
labeo and flavius set our battles on
’tis three o’clock and romans yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight
enter fighting soldiers of both armies then brutus messala young cato lucilius flavius and others
yet countrymen o yet hold up your heads
i will proclaim my name about the field
i am the son of marcus cato ho
a foe to tyrants and my country’s friend
i am the son of marcus cato ho
and i am brutus marcus brutus i brutus my country’s friend know me for brutus
cato is overpowered and falls lucilius
o young and noble cato art thou down
why now thou diest as bravely as titinius and mayst be honour’d being cato’s son
only i yield to die there is so much that thou wilt kill me straight offering money kill brutus and be honour’d in his death
brutus is ta’en brutus is ta’en my lord
safe antony brutus is safe enough
i dare assure thee that no enemy shall ever take alive the noble brutus
the gods defend him from so great a shame
when you do find him or alive or dead he will be found like brutus like himself
this is not brutus friend but i assure you a prize no less in worth
keep this man safe give him all kindness
i had rather have such men my friends than enemies
go on and see whether brutus be alive or dead and bring us word unto octavius’ tent how everything is chanc’d
exeunt scene v another part of the field
enter brutus dardanius clitus strato and volumnius
come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
statilius show’d the torch light but my lord he came not back he is or ta’en or slain
slaying is the word it is a deed in fashion
no not for all the world
shall i do such a deed
what ill request did brutus make to thee
now is that noble vessel full of grief that it runs over even at his eyes
come hither good volumnius list a word
why this volumnius the ghost of caesar hath appear’d to me two several times by night at sardis once and this last night here in philippi fields
i know my hour is come
nay i am sure it is volumnius
thou seest the world volumnius how it goes our enemies have beat us to the pit
low alarums it is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us
good volumnius thou know’st that we two went to school together even for that our love of old i pr’ythee hold thou my sword hilts whilst i run on it
that’s not an office for a friend my lord
farewell to you and you and you volumnius
strato thou hast been all this while asleep farewell to thee too strato —countrymen my heart doth joy that yet in all my life i found no man but he was true to me
i shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto
so fare you well at once for brutus’ tongue hath almost ended his life’s history
night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest that have but labour’d to attain this hour
cry within “fly fly fly ” clitus
exeunt clitus dardanius and volumnius i pr’ythee strato stay thou by thy lord
thou art a fellow of a good respect thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it
hold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it
farewell good strato —caesar now be still i kill’d not thee with half so good a will
he runs on his sword and dies alarum
enter antony octavius messala lucilius and the army
free from the bondage you are in messala
the conquerors can but make a fire of him for brutus only overcame himself and no man else hath honour by his death
i thank thee brutus that thou hast prov’d lucilius’ saying true
all that serv’d brutus i will entertain them
fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
ay if messala will prefer me to you
i held the sword and he did run on it
octavius then take him to follow thee that did the latest service to my master
this was the noblest roman of them all
all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them
his life was gentle and the elements so mix’d in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world “this was a man ” octavius
according to his virtue let us use him with all respect and rites of burial
within my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier order’d honourably
so call the field to rest and let’s away to part the glories of this happy day

edmund younger bastard son to gloucester
knights attending on the king officers messengers soldiers and attendants
a room of state in king lear’s palace
i thought the king had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall
it did always seem so to us but now in the division of the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most for qualities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety
is not this your son my lord
his breeding sir hath been at my charge i have so often blush’d to acknowledge him that now i am braz’d to’t
sir this young fellow’s mother could whereupon she grew round wombed and had indeed sir a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed
i cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so proper
but i have a son sir by order of law some year elder than this who yet is no dearer in my account though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for yet was his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the whoreson must be acknowledged
do you know this noble gentleman edmund
my lord of kent remember him hereafter as my honourable friend
i must love you and sue to know you better
he hath been out nine years and away he shall again
sennet within enter lear cornwall albany goneril regan cordelia and attendants
attend the lords of france and burgundy gloucester
meantime we shall express our darker purpose
know that we have divided in three our kingdom and ’tis our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age conferring them on younger strengths while we unburden’d crawl toward death
our son of cornwall and you our no less loving son of albany we have this hour a constant will to publish our daughters’ several dowers that future strife may be prevented now
the princes france and burgundy great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love long in our court have made their amorous sojourn and here are to be answer’d
tell me my daughters — since now we will divest us both of rule interest of territory cares of state — which of you shall we say doth love us most
that we our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge —goneril our eldest born speak first
sir i love you more than word can wield the matter dearer than eyesight space and liberty beyond what can be valu’d rich or rare no less than life with grace health beauty honour as much as child e’er lov’d or father found a love that makes breath poor and speech unable beyond all manner of so much i love you
of all these bounds even from this line to this with shadowy forests and with champains rich’d with plenteous rivers and wide skirted meads we make thee lady to thine and albany’s issue be this perpetual —what says our second daughter our dearest regan wife of cornwall
sir i am made of the self mettle as my sister and prize me at her worth
in my true heart i find she names my very deed of love only she comes too short that i profess myself an enemy to all other joys which the most precious square of sense possesses and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness’ love
aside then poor cordelia and yet not so since i am sure my love’s more ponderous than my tongue
to thee and thine hereditary ever remain this ample third of our fair kingdom no less in space validity and pleasure than that conferr’d on goneril —now our joy although the last and least to whose young love the vines of france and milk of burgundy strive to be interess’d what can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters
nothing will come of nothing speak again
unhappy that i am i cannot heave my heart into my mouth i love your majesty according to my bond no more nor less
mend your speech a little lest you may mar your fortunes
good my lord you have begot me bred me lov’d me i return those duties back as are right fit obey you love you and most honour you
why have my sisters husbands if they say they love you all
haply when i shall wed that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him half my care and duty sure i shall never marry like my sisters to love my father all
but goes thy heart with this
so young my lord and true
let it be so thy truth then be thy dower for by the sacred radiance of the sun the mysteries of hecate and the night by all the operation of the orbs from whom we do exist and cease to be here i disclaim all my paternal care propinquity and property of blood and as a stranger to my heart and me hold thee from this for ever
the barbarous scythian or he that makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite shall to my bosom be as well neighbour’d pitied and reliev’d as thou my sometime daughter
come not between the dragon and his wrath
i lov’d her most and thought to set my rest on her kind nursery
to cordelia hence and avoid my sight
so be my grave my peace as here i give her father’s heart from her
cornwall and albany with my two daughters’ dowers digest this third let pride which she calls plainness marry her
i do invest you jointly with my power pre eminence and all the large effects that troop with majesty
ourself by monthly course with reservation of an hundred knights by you to be sustain’d shall our abode make with you by due turn
only we shall retain the name and all the addition to a king the sway revenue execution of the rest beloved sons be yours which to confirm this coronet part between you
royal lear whom i have ever honour’d as my king lov’d as my father as my master follow’d as my great patron thought on in my prayers — lear
the bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft
let it fall rather though the fork invade the region of my heart be kent unmannerly when lear is mad
what wouldst thou do old man
think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows
to plainness honour’s bound when majesty falls to folly
reverse thy state and in thy best consideration check this hideous rashness answer my life my judgement thy youngest daughter does not love thee least nor are those empty hearted whose low sounds reverb no hollowness
kent on thy life no more
my life i never held but as a pawn to wage against thine enemies ne’er fear to lose it thy safety being the motive
see better lear and let me still remain the true blank of thine eye
now by apollo king thou swear’st thy gods in vain
laying his hand on his sword albany and cornwall
kill thy physician and the fee bestow upon the foul disease
revoke thy gift or whilst i can vent clamour from my throat i’ll tell thee thou dost evil
since thou hast sought to make us break our vows which we durst never yet and with strain’d pride to come betwixt our sentences and our power which nor our nature nor our place can bear our potency made good take thy reward
five days we do allot thee for provision to shield thee from disasters of the world and on the sixth to turn thy hated back upon our kingdom if on the next day following thy banish’d trunk be found in our dominions the moment is thy death
by jupiter this shall not be revok’d
fare thee well king sith thus thou wilt appear freedom lives hence and banishment is here
to cordelia the gods to their dear shelter take thee maid that justly think’st and hast most rightly said
to goneril and regan and your large speeches may your deeds approve that good effects may spring from words of love
thus kent o princes bids you all adieu he’ll shape his old course in a country new
re enter gloucester with france burgundy and attendants
here’s france and burgundy my noble lord
my lord of burgundy we first address toward you who with this king hath rivall’d for our daughter what in the least will you require in present dower with her or cease your quest of love
most royal majesty i crave no more than hath your highness offer’d nor will you tender less
right noble burgundy when she was dear to us we did hold her so but now her price is fall’n
sir there she stands if aught within that little seeming substance or all of it with our displeasure piec’d and nothing more may fitly like your grace she’s there and she is yours
will you with those infirmities she owes unfriended new adopted to our hate dower’d with our curse and stranger’d with our oath take her or leave her
pardon me royal sir election makes not up in such conditions
then leave her sir for by the power that made me i tell you all her wealth
to france for you great king i would not from your love make such a stray to match you where i hate therefore beseech you t’avert your liking a more worthier way than on a wretch whom nature is asham’d almost t’acknowledge hers
this is most strange that she who even but now was your best object the argument of your praise balm of your age the best the dearest should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favour
sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your fore vouch’d affection fall into taint which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle should never plant in me
i yet beseech your majesty if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend i’ll do’t before i speak —that you make known it is no vicious blot murder or foulness no unchaste action or dishonour’d step that hath depriv’d me of your grace and favour but even for want of that for which i am richer a still soliciting eye and such a tongue as i am glad i have not though not to have it hath lost me in your liking
better thou hadst not been born than not to have pleas’d me better
is it but this —a tardiness in nature which often leaves the history unspoke that it intends to do
my lord of burgundy what say you to the lady
love’s not love when it is mingled with regards that stands aloof from the entire point
royal king give but that portion which yourself propos’d and here i take cordelia by the hand duchess of burgundy
nothing i have sworn i am firm
i am sorry then you have so lost a father that you must lose a husband
since that respects of fortunes are his love i shall not be his wife
fairest cordelia that art most rich being poor most choice forsaken and most lov’d despis’d
thee and thy virtues here i seize upon be it lawful i take up what’s cast away
’tis strange that from their cold’st neglect my love should kindle to inflam’d respect
thy dowerless daughter king thrown to my chance is queen of us of ours and our fair france not all the dukes of waterish burgundy can buy this unpriz’d precious maid of me
bid them farewell cordelia though unkind thou losest here a better where to find
thou hast her france let her be thine for we have no such daughter nor shall ever see that face of hers again
therefore be gone without our grace our love our benison
exeunt lear burgundy cornwall albany gloucester and attendants france
the jewels of our father with wash’d eyes cordelia leaves you i know you what you are and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are nam’d
love well our father to your professed bosoms i commit him but yet alas stood i within his grace i would prefer him to a better place
let your study be to content your lord who hath receiv’d you at fortune’s alms
you have obedience scanted and well are worth the want that you have wanted
time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides who covers faults at last shame derides
sister it is not little i have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both
i think our father will hence tonight
that’s most certain and with you next month with us
you see how full of changes his age is the observation we have made of it hath not been little he always loved our sister most and with what poor judgement he hath now cast her off appears too grossly
’tis the infirmity of his age yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself
the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long engrafted condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent’s banishment
there is further compliment of leave taking between france and him
pray you let us hit together if our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears this last surrender of his will but offend us
we shall further think of it
we must do something and i’ th’ heat
a hall in the earl of gloucester’s castle
thou nature art my goddess to thy law my services are bound
wherefore should i stand in the plague of custom and permit the curiosity of nations to deprive me
for that i am some twelve or fourteen moonshines lag of a brother
when my dimensions are as well compact my mind as generous and my shape as true as honest madam’s issue
why brand they us with base
who in the lusty stealth of nature take more composition and fierce quality than doth within a dull stale tired bed go to the creating a whole tribe of fops got ’tween asleep and wake
well then legitimate edgar i must have your land our father’s love is to the bastard edmund as to the legitimate fine word legitimate
well my legitimate if this letter speed and my invention thrive edmund the base shall top the legitimate
now gods stand up for bastards
all this done upon the gad —edmund how now
why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter
i know no news my lord
what needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket
the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself
come if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles
i beseech you sir pardon me
it is a letter from my brother that i have not all o’er read and for so much as i have perus’d i find it not fit for your o’er looking
i shall offend either to detain or give it
the contents as in part i understand them are to blame
i hope for my brother’s justification he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue
reads ‘this policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them
i begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not as it hath power but as it is suffered
come to me that of this i may speak more
if our father would sleep till i waked him you should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live the beloved of your brother edgar ’ hum
‘sleep till i wake him you should enjoy half his revenue ’—my son edgar
had he a hand to write this
a heart and brain to breed it in
it was not brought me my lord there’s the cunning of it
i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet
you know the character to be your brother’s
if the matter were good my lord i durst swear it were his but in respect of that i would fain think it were not
it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is not in the contents
has he never before sounded you in this business
but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age and fathers declined the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
his very opinion in the letter
go sirrah seek him i’ll apprehend him
i do not well know my lord
if it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience
i dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour and to no other pretence of danger
if your honour judge it meet i will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening
he cannot be such a monster
to his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him
edmund seek him out wind me into him i pray you frame the business after your own wisdom
i would unstate myself to be in a due resolution
i will seek him sir presently convey the business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal
these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects
love cools friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father
this villain of mine comes under the prediction there’s son against father the king falls from bias of nature there’s father against child
we have seen the best of our time
machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves
find out this villain edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it carefully —and the noble and true hearted kent banished
this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeits of our own behaviour we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on
an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star
my father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under ursa major so that it follows i am rough and lecherous
i should have been that i am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing
he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy my cue is villainous melancholy with a sigh like tom o’bedlam —o these eclipses do portend these divisions
how now brother edmund what serious contemplation are you in
i am thinking brother of a prediction i read this other day what should follow these eclipses
do you busy yourself with that
i promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent death dearth dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state menaces and maledictions against king and nobles needless diffidences banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts nuptial breaches and i know not what
how long have you been a sectary astronomical
when saw you my father last
found you no displeasure in him by word nor countenance
bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay
some villain hath done me wrong
i pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower and as i say retire with me to my lodging from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak pray ye go there’s my key
if you do stir abroad go armed
brother i advise you to the best i am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you i have told you what i have seen and heard
but faintly nothing like the image and horror of it pray you away
shall i hear from you anon
i do serve you in this business
and a brother noble whose nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none on whose foolish honesty my practices ride easy
let me if not by birth have lands by wit all with me’s meet that i can fashion fit
a room in the duke of albany’s palace
did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool
by day and night he wrongs me every hour he flashes into one gross crime or other that sets us all at odds i’ll not endure it his knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us on every trifle
when he returns from hunting i will not speak with him say i am sick
if you come slack of former services you shall do well the fault of it i’ll answer
he’s coming madam i hear him
put on what weary negligence you please you and your fellows i’d have it come to question if he distaste it let him to our sister whose mind and mine i know in that are one not to be overruled
idle old man that still would manage those authorities that he hath given away
now by my life old fools are babes again and must be us’d with checks as flatteries when they are seen abus’d
and let his knights have colder looks among you what grows of it no matter advise your fellows so i would breed from hence occasions and i shall that i may speak
i’ll write straight to my sister to hold my very course
if but as well i other accents borrow that can my speech defuse my good intent may carry through itself to that full issue for which i rais’d my likeness
now banish’d kent if thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn’d so may it come thy master whom thou lov’st shall find thee full of labours
enter king lear knights and attendants
let me not stay a jot for dinner go get it ready
i do profess to be no less than i seem to serve him truly that will put me in trust to love him that is honest to converse with him that is wise and says little to fear judgement to fight when i cannot choose and to eat no fish
a very honest hearted fellow and as poor as the king
if thou be’st as poor for a subject as he’s for a king thou art poor enough
no sir but you have that in your countenance which i would fain call master
i can keep honest counsel ride run mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly
that which ordinary men are fit for i am qualified in and the best of me is diligence
not so young sir to love a woman for singing nor so old to dote on her for anything i have years on my back forty eight
follow me thou shalt serve me
if i like thee no worse after dinner i will not part from thee yet
go you and call my fool hither
you you sirrah where’s my daughter
so please you — exit lear
exit a knight where’s my fool
ho i think the world’s asleep
he says my lord your daughter is not well
why came not the slave back to me when i called him
sir he answered me in the roundest manner he would not
my lord i know not what the matter is but to my judgement your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont there’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and your daughter
i beseech you pardon me my lord if i be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when i think your highness wronged
thou but rememberest me of mine own conception i have perceived a most faint neglect of late which i have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness i will look further into’t
i have not seen him this two days
since my young lady’s going into france sir the fool hath much pined away
no more of that i have noted it well
go you and tell my daughter i would speak with her
exit attendant go you call hither my fool
exit another attendant re enter oswald
o you sir you come you hither sir who am i sir
my lord’s knave you whoreson dog
i am none of these my lord i beseech your pardon
do you bandy looks with me you rascal
i’ll not be struck my lord
nor tripp’d neither you base football player
thou serv’st me and i’ll love thee
i’ll teach you differences away away
if you will measure your lubber’s length again tarry but away
now my friendly knave i thank thee there’s earnest of thy service
let me hire him too here’s my coxcomb
how now my pretty knave how dost thou
sirrah you were best take my coxcomb
why for taking one’s part that’s out of favour
nay an thou canst not smile as the wind sits thou’lt catch cold shortly there take my coxcomb why this fellow has banish’d two on’s daughters and did the third a blessing against his will if thou follow him thou must needs wear my coxcomb
would i had two coxcombs and two daughters
if i gave them all my living i’d keep my coxcombs myself
there’s mine beg another of thy daughters
truth’s a dog must to kennel he must be whipped out when the lady brach may stand by the fire and stink
sirrah i’ll teach thee a speech
mark it nuncle have more than thou showest speak less than thou knowest lend less than thou owest ride more than thou goest learn more than thou trowest set less than thou throwest leave thy drink and thy whore and keep in a door and thou shalt have more than two tens to a score
then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer you gave me nothing for’t
can you make no use of nothing nuncle
why no boy nothing can be made out of nothing
to kent prythee tell him so much the rent of his land comes to he will not believe a fool
dost thou know the difference my boy between a bitter fool and a sweet one
that lord that counsell’d thee to give away thy land come place him here by me do thou for him stand
the sweet and bitter fool will presently appear the one in motley here the other found out there
dost thou call me fool boy
all thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with
this is not altogether fool my lord
no faith lords and great men will not let me if i had a monopoly out they would have part on’t and ladies too they will not let me have all the fool to myself they’ll be snatching
nuncle give me an egg and i’ll give thee two crowns
what two crowns shall they be
why after i have cut the egg i’ the middle and eat up the meat the two crowns of the egg
when thou clovest thy crown i’ the middle and gav’st away both parts thou bor’st thine ass on thy back o’er the dirt thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav’st thy golden one away
if i speak like myself in this let him be whipped that first finds it so
singing fools had ne’er less grace in a year for wise men are grown foppish and know not how their wits to wear their manners are so apish
when were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah
i have used it nuncle e’er since thou mad’st thy daughters thy mothers for when thou gav’st them the rod and put’st down thine own breeches singing then they for sudden joy did weep and i for sorrow sung that such a king should play bo peep and go the fools among
prythee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie i would fain learn to lie
an you lie sirrah we’ll have you whipped
i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are they’ll have me whipped for speaking true thou’lt have me whipped for lying and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace
i had rather be any kind o’thing than a fool and yet i would not be thee nuncle thou hast pared thy wit o’both sides and left nothing i’ the middle here comes one o’ the parings
methinks you are too much of late i’ the frown
thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning
now thou art an o without a figure i am better than thou art now
i am a fool thou art nothing
to goneril yes forsooth i will hold my tongue
so your face bids me though you say nothing
mum mum he that keeps nor crust nor crum weary of all shall want some
not only sir this your all licens’d fool but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth in rank and not to be endured riots
sir i had thought by making this well known unto you to have found a safe redress but now grow fearful by what yourself too late have spoke and done that you protect this course and put it on by your allowance which if you should the fault would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep which in the tender of a wholesome weal might in their working do you that offence which else were shame that then necessity will call discreet proceeding
for you know nuncle the hedge sparrow fed the cuckoo so long that it’s had it head bit off by it young
so out went the candle and we were left darkling
come sir i would you would make use of that good wisdom whereof i know you are fraught and put away these dispositions which of late transform you from what you rightly are
may not an ass know when the cart draws the horse
this is not lear doth lear walk thus
either his notion weakens his discernings are lethargied
who is it that can tell me who i am
i would learn that for by the marks of sovereignty knowledge and reason i should be false persuaded i had daughters
which they will make an obedient father
this admiration sir is much o’ the favour of other your new pranks
i do beseech you to understand my purposes aright as you are old and reverend you should be wise
here do you keep a hundred knights and squires men so disorder’d so debosh’d and bold that this our court infected with their manners shows like a riotous inn
epicurism and lust makes it more like a tavern or a brothel than a grac’d palace
the shame itself doth speak for instant remedy
be then desir’d by her that else will take the thing she begs a little to disquantity your train and the remainder that shall still depend to be such men as may besort your age which know themselves and you
saddle my horses call my train together
i’ll not trouble thee yet have i left a daughter
you strike my people and your disorder’d rabble make servants of their betters
woe that too late repents — to albany o sir are you come
ingratitude thou marble hearted fiend more hideous when thou show’st thee in a child than the sea monster
to goneril detested kite thou liest
my train are men of choice and rarest parts that all particulars of duty know and in the most exact regard support the worships of their name
o most small fault how ugly didst thou in cordelia show
which like an engine wrench’d my frame of nature from the fix’d place drew from my heart all love and added to the gall
striking his head beat at this gate that let thy folly in and thy dear judgement out
my lord i am guiltless as i am ignorant of what hath moved you
it may be so my lord
hear nature hear dear goddess hear suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful
dry up in her the organs of increase and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honour her
if she must teem create her child of spleen that it may live and be a thwart disnatur’d torment to her
let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks turn all her mother’s pains and benefits to laughter and contempt that she may feel how sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child
now gods that we adore whereof comes this
never afflict yourself to know more of it but let his disposition have that scope that dotage gives it
what fifty of my followers at a clap
i am asham’d that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus that these hot tears which break from me perforce should make thee worth them
th’untented woundings of a father’s curse pierce every sense about thee
old fond eyes beweep this cause again i’ll pluck ye out and cast you with the waters that you lose to temper clay
i have another daughter who i am sure is kind and comfortable when she shall hear this of thee with her nails she’ll flay thy wolvish visage
thou shalt find that i’ll resume the shape which thou dost think i have cast off for ever
exeunt lear kent and attendants goneril
i cannot be so partial goneril to the great love i bear you — goneril
to the fool you sir more knave than fool after your master
nuncle lear nuncle lear tarry and take the fool with thee
a fox when one has caught her and such a daughter should sure to the slaughter if my cap would buy a halter so the fool follows after
this man hath had good counsel —a hundred knights
’tis politic and safe to let him keep at point a hundred knights yes that on every dream each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike he may enguard his dotage with their powers and hold our lives in mercy
well you may fear too far
safer than trust too far let me still take away the harms i fear not fear still to be taken i know his heart
what he hath utter’d i have writ my sister if she sustain him and his hundred knights when i have show’d th’unfitness — re enter oswald
what have you writ that letter to my sister
take you some company and away to horse inform her full of my particular fear and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more
get you gone and hasten your return
exit oswald no no my lord
this milky gentleness and course of yours though i condemn not yet under pardon you are much more attask’d for want of wisdom than prais’d for harmful mildness
how far your eyes may pierce i cannot tell striving to better oft we mar what’s well
exeunt scene v court before the duke of albany’s palace
go you before to gloucester with these letters acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter
if your diligence be not speedy i shall be there afore you
i will not sleep my lord till i have delivered your letter
if a man’s brains were in’s heels were’t not in danger of kibes
then i prythee be merry thy wit shall not go slipshod
shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly for though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple yet i can tell what i can tell
she’ll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab
thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i’the middle on’s face
why to keep one’s eyes of either side’s nose that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into
canst tell how an oyster makes his shell
nor i neither but i can tell why a snail has a house
why to put’s head in not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case
thy asses are gone about ’em
the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason
yes indeed thou wouldst make a good fool
to tak’t again perforce —monster ingratitude
if thou wert my fool nuncle i’ld have thee beaten for being old before thy time
thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise
o let me not be mad not mad sweet heaven
keep me in temper i would not be mad
she that’s a maid now and laughs at my departure shall not be a maid long unless things be cut shorter
a court within the castle of the earl of gloucester
i have been with your father and given him notice that the duke of cornwall and regan his duchess will be here with him this night
you have heard of the news abroad i mean the whispered ones for they are yet but ear kissing arguments
not i pray you what are they
have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two dukes of cornwall and albany
you may do then in time
this weaves itself perforce into my business
my father hath set guard to take my brother and i have one thing of a queasy question which i must act
brother a word descend brother i say
my father watches o sir fly this place intelligence is given where you are hid you have now the good advantage of the night
have you not spoken ’gainst the duke of cornwall
he’s coming hither now i’ the night i’ the haste and regan with him have you nothing said upon his party ’gainst the duke of albany
i am sure on’t not a word
i hear my father coming —pardon me in cunning i must draw my sword upon you draw seem to defend yourself now quit you well
exit edgar some blood drawn on me would beget opinion of my more fierce endeavour wounds his arm i have seen drunkards do more than this in sport
enter gloucester and servants with torches
here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon to stand auspicious mistress
when by no means he could — gloucester
exeunt servants —by no means what
persuade me to the murder of your lordship but that i told him the revenging gods ’gainst parricides did all their thunders bend spoke with how manifold and strong a bond the child was bound to the father sir in fine seeing how loathly opposite i stood to his unnatural purpose in fell motion with his prepared sword he charges home my unprovided body latch’d mine arm but when he saw my best alarum’d spirits bold in the quarrel’s right rous’d to th’encounter or whether gasted by the noise i made full suddenly he fled
let him fly far not in this land shall he remain uncaught and found—dispatch’d
the noble duke my master my worthy arch and patron comes tonight by his authority i will proclaim it that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks bringing the murderous coward to the stake he that conceals him death
when i dissuaded him from his intent and found him pight to do it with curst speech i threaten’d to discover him he replied ‘thou unpossessing bastard
dost thou think if i would stand against thee would the reposal of any trust virtue or worth in thee make thy words faith’d
no what i should deny as this i would ay though thou didst produce my very character i’d turn it all to thy suggestion plot and damned practice and thou must make a dullard of the world if they not thought the profits of my death were very pregnant and potential spurs to make thee seek it
would he deny his letter said he
tucket within hark the duke’s trumpets
i know not why he comes
all ports i’ll bar the villain shall not scape the duke must grant me that besides his picture i will send far and near that all the kingdom may have due note of him and of my land loyal and natural boy i’ll work the means to make thee capable
since i came hither which i can call but now i have heard strange news
if it be true all vengeance comes too short which can pursue th’offender
o madam my old heart is crack’d it’s crack’d
what did my father’s godson seek your life
o lady lady shame would have it hid
was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father
i know not madam ’tis too bad too bad
yes madam he was of that consort
no marvel then though he were ill affected ’tis they have put him on the old man’s death to have the expense and waste of his revenues
i have this present evening from my sister been well inform’d of them and with such cautions that if they come to sojourn at my house i’ll not be there
edmund i hear that you have shown your father a childlike office
he did bewray his practice and receiv’d this hurt you see striving to apprehend him
if he be taken he shall never more be fear’d of doing harm make your own purpose how in my strength you please
for you edmund whose virtue and obedience doth this instant so much commend itself you shall be ours natures of such deep trust we shall much need you we first seize on
i shall serve you sir truly however else
for him i thank your grace
you know not why we came to visit you
thus out of season threading dark ey’d night occasions noble gloucester of some poise wherein we must have use of your advice
our father he hath writ so hath our sister of differences which i best thought it fit to answer from our home the several messengers from hence attend dispatch
our good old friend lay comforts to your bosom and bestow your needful counsel to our business which craves the instant use
i serve you madam your graces are right welcome
good dawning to thee friend art of this house
where may we set our horses
prythee if thou lov’st me tell me
why then i care not for thee
if i had thee in lipsbury pinfold i would make thee care for me
why dost thou use me thus
what dost thou know me for
a knave a rascal an eater of broken meats a base proud shallow beggarly three suited hundred pound filthy worsted stocking knave a lily livered action taking whoreson glass gazing super serviceable finical rogue one trunk inheriting slave one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service and art nothing but the composition of a knave beggar coward pander and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch one whom i will beat into clamorous whining if thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition
why what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail on one that’s neither known of thee nor knows thee
what a brazen faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me
is it two days ago since i tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king
draw you rogue for though it be night yet the moon shines i’ll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you draw you whoreson cullionly barber monger draw
i have nothing to do with thee
draw you rascal you come with letters against the king and take vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father draw you rogue or i’ll so carbonado your shanks —draw you rascal come your ways
strike you slave stand rogue stand you neat slave strike
enter edmund cornwall regan gloucester and servants
with you goodman boy if you please come i’ll flesh ye come on young master
keep peace upon your lives he dies that strikes again
the messengers from our sister and the king
i am scarce in breath my lord
no marvel you have so bestirr’d your valour
you cowardly rascal nature disclaims in thee a tailor made thee
thou art a strange fellow a tailor make a man
ay a tailor sir a stonecutter or a painter could not have made him so ill though he had been but two years at the trade
speak yet how grew your quarrel
this ancient ruffian sir whose life i have spared at suit of his grey beard — kent
my lord if you’ll give me leave i will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him
spare my grey beard you wagtail
you beastly knave know you no reverence
yes sir but anger hath a privilege
that such a slave as this should wear a sword who wears no honesty
such smiling rogues as these like rats oft bite the holy cords a twain which are too intrince t’unloose smooth every passion that in the natures of their lords rebel bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their masters knowing naught like dogs but following
a plague upon your epileptic visage
smile you my speeches as i were a fool
goose if i had you upon sarum plain i’d drive ye cackling home to camelot
what art thou mad old fellow
no contraries hold more antipathy than i and such a knave
why dost thou call him knave
no more perchance does mine or his or hers
sir ’tis my occupation to be plain i have seen better faces in my time than stands on any shoulder that i see before me at this instant
this is some fellow who having been prais’d for bluntness doth affect a saucy roughness and constrains the garb quite from his nature he cannot flatter he an honest mind and plain he must speak truth
an they will take it so if not he’s plain
these kind of knaves i know which in this plainness harbour more craft and more corrupter ends than twenty silly ducking observants that stretch their duties nicely
sir in good faith in sincere verity under th’allowance of your great aspect whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire on flickering phoebus’ front — cornwall
to go out of my dialect which you discommend so much
i know sir i am no flatterer he that beguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave which for my part i will not be though i should win your displeasure to entreat me to’t
what was the offence you gave him
i never gave him any it pleas’d the king his master very late to strike at me upon his misconstruction when he compact and flattering his displeasure tripp’d me behind being down insulted rail’d and put upon him such a deal of man that worthied him got praises of the king for him attempting who was self subdu’d and in the fleshment of this dread exploit drew on me here again
none of these rogues and cowards but ajax is their fool
you stubborn ancient knave you reverent braggart we’ll teach you
sir i am too old to learn call not your stocks for me i serve the king on whose employment i was sent to you you shall do small respect show too bold malice against the grace and person of my master stocking his messenger
as i have life and honour there shall he sit till noon
till night my lord and all night too
why madam if i were your father’s dog you should not use me so
sir being his knave i will
this is a fellow of the selfsame colour our sister speaks of
let me beseech your grace not to do so his fault is much and the good king his master will check him for’t your purpos’d low correction is such as basest and contemned’st wretches for pilferings and most common trespasses are punish’d with
the king must take it ill that he so slightly valued in his messenger should have him thus restrained
my sister may receive it much more worse to have her gentleman abus’d assaulted for following her affairs
kent is put in the stocks cornwall
exeunt all but gloucester and kent gloucester
i am sorry for thee friend ’tis the duke’s pleasure whose disposition all the world well knows will not be rubb’d nor stopp’d i’ll entreat for thee
pray do not sir i have watch’d and travell’d hard some time i shall sleep out the rest i’ll whistle
a good man’s fortune may grow out at heels give you good morrow
the duke’s to blame in this ’twill be ill taken
good king that must approve the common saw thou out of heaven’s benediction com’st to the warm sun
approach thou beacon to this under globe that by thy comfortable beams i may peruse this letter
nothing almost sees miracles but misery
i know ’tis from cordelia who hath most fortunately been inform’d of my obscured course
and shall find time from this enormous state seeking to give losses their remedies
all weary and o’erwatch’d take vantage heavy eyes not to behold this shameful lodging
fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel
i heard myself proclaim’d and by the happy hollow of a tree escap’d the hunt
no port is free no place that guard and most unusual vigilance does not attend my taking
while i may scape i will preserve myself and am bethought to take the basest and most poorest shape that ever penury in contempt of man brought near to beast my face i’ll grime with filth blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots and with presented nakedness outface the winds and persecutions of the sky
the country gives me proof and precedent of bedlam beggars who with roaring voices strike in their numb’d and mortified bare arms pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary and with this horrible object from low farms poor pelting villages sheep cotes and mills sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers enforce their charity
poor tom that’s something yet edgar i nothing am
before gloucester’s castle kent in the stocks
’tis strange that they should so depart from home and not send back my messenger
as i learn’d the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove
mak’st thou this shame thy pastime
horses are tied by the heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by the loins and men by the legs when a man is overlusty at legs then he wears wooden nether stocks
what’s he that hath so much thy place mistook to set thee here
it is both he and she your son and daughter
they could not would not do’t ’tis worse than murder to do upon respect such violent outrage resolve me with all modest haste which way thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage coming from us
your son and daughter found this trespass worth the shame which here it suffers
winter’s not gone yet if the wild geese fly that way
fathers that wear rags do make their children blind but fathers that bear bags shall see their children kind
fortune that arrant whore ne’er turns the key to th’ poor
but for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year
o how this mother swells up toward my heart
hysterica passio down thou climbing sorrow thy element’s below
with the earl sir here within
made you no more offence but what you speak of
how chance the king comes with so small a number
an thou hadst been set i’ the stocks for that question thou hadst well deserved it
we’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no labouring i’the winter
all that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking
let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following it but the great one that goes upward let him draw thee after
when a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again i would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
that sir which serves and seeks for gain and follows but for form will pack when it begins to rain and leave thee in the storm
but i will tarry the fool will stay and let the wise man fly the knave turns fool that runs away the fool no knave perdy
they have travell’d all the night
mere fetches the images of revolt and flying off
my dear lord you know the fiery quality of the duke how unremovable and fix’d he is in his own course
why gloucester gloucester i’d speak with the duke of cornwall and his wife
well my good lord i have inform’d them so
the king would speak with cornwall the dear father would with his daughter speak commands tends service are they inform’d of this
the fiery duke tell the hot duke that— no but not yet maybe he is not well infirmity doth still neglect all office whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves when nature being oppress’d commands the mind to suffer with the body i’ll forbear and am fallen out with my more headier will to take the indispos’d and sickly fit for the sound man
looking on kent death on my state
this act persuades me that this remotion of the duke and her is practice only
go tell the duke and’s wife i’d speak with them now presently bid them come forth and hear me or at their chamber door i’ll beat the drum till it cry sleep to death
i would have all well betwixt you
o me my heart my rising heart
cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels when she put ’em i’ the paste alive she knapped ’em o’ the coxcombs with a stick and cried ‘down wantons down ’ ’twas her brother that in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay
enter cornwall regan gloucester and servants
kent here set at liberty regan
i am glad to see your highness
regan i think you are i know what reason i have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad i would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb sepulchring an adultress
to kent o are you free
some other time for that —beloved regan thy sister’s naught o regan she hath tied sharp tooth’d unkindness like a vulture here
points to his heart i can scarce speak to thee thou’lt not believe with how deprav’d a quality—o regan
i pray you sir take patience
i have hope you less know how to value her desert than she to scant her duty
i cannot think my sister in the least would fail her obligation
if sir perchance she have restrain’d the riots of your followers ’tis on such ground and to such wholesome end as clears her from all blame
o sir you are old nature in you stands on the very verge of her confine you should be rul’d and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself
therefore i pray you that to our sister you do make return say you have wrong’d her sir
do you but mark how this becomes the house
‘dear daughter i confess that i am old kneeling age is unnecessary on my knees i beg that you’ll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food ’ regan
these are unsightly tricks return you to my sister
rising never regan she hath abated me of half my train look’d black upon me struck me with her tongue most serpent like upon the very heart
all the stor’d vengeances of heaven fall on her ingrateful top
strike her young bones you taking airs with lameness
you nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes
infect her beauty you fen suck’d fogs drawn by the powerful sun to fall and blast her pride
so will you wish on me when the rash mood is on
no regan thou shalt never have my curse
thy tender hefted nature shall not give thee o’er to harshness
her eyes are fierce but thine do comfort and not burn
’tis not in thee to grudge my pleasures to cut off my train to bandy hasty words to scant my sizes and in conclusion to oppose the bolt against my coming in
thou better know’st the offices of nature bond of childhood effects of courtesy dues of gratitude thy half o’ the kingdom hast thou not forgot wherein i thee endow’d
who put my man i’ the stocks
i know’t my sister’s this approves her letter that she would soon be here
this is a slave whose easy borrowed pride dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
regan i have good hope thou didst not know on’t
if you do love old men if your sweet sway allow obedience if yourselves are old make it your cause send down and take my part
to goneril art not asham’d to look upon this beard
o regan wilt thou take her by the hand
why not by the hand sir
all’s not offence that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so
o sides you are too tough
how came my man i’ the stocks
i set him there sir but his own disorders deserv’d much less advancement
i pray you father being weak seem so
if till the expiration of your month you will return and sojourn with my sister dismissing half your train come then to me i am now from home and out of that provision which shall be needful for your entertainment
return to her and fifty men dismiss’d
no rather i abjure all roofs and choose to wage against the enmity o’ the air to be a comrade with the wolf and owl necessity’s sharp pinch
why the hot blooded france that dowerless took our youngest born i could as well be brought to knee his throne and squire like pension beg to keep base life afoot
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter to this detested groom
i prythee daughter do not make me mad i will not trouble thee my child farewell we’ll no more meet no more see one another
but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter or rather a disease that’s in my flesh which i must needs call mine
thou art a boil a plague sore or embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood
but i’ll not chide thee let shame come when it will i do not call it i do not bid the thunder bearer shoot nor tell tales of thee to high judging jove mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure i can be patient i can stay with regan i and my hundred knights
not altogether so i look’d not for you yet nor am provided for your fit welcome
give ear sir to my sister for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old and so— but she knows what she does
i dare avouch it sir what fifty followers
what should you need of more
yea or so many sith that both charge and danger speak ’gainst so great a number
how in one house should many people under two commands hold amity
why might not you my lord receive attendance from those that she calls servants or from mine
if then they chanc’d to slack ye we could control them
if you will come to me — for now i spy a danger —i entreat you to bring but five and twenty to no more will i give place or notice
i gave you all — regan
and in good time you gave it
made you my guardians my depositaries but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number
what must i come to you with five and twenty regan said you so
and speak’t again my lord no more with me
those wicked creatures yet do look well favour’d when others are more wicked not being the worst stands in some rank of praise
to goneril i’ll go with thee thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty and thou art twice her love
hear me my lord what need you five and twenty
to follow in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you
o reason not the need our basest beggars are in the poorest thing superfluous allow not nature more than nature needs man’s life is cheap as beast’s
thou art a lady if only to go warm were gorgeous why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st which scarcely keeps thee warm
but for true need — you heavens give me that patience patience i need
you see me here you gods a poor old man as full of grief as age wretched in both
if it be you that stirs these daughters’ hearts against their father fool me not so much to bear it tamely touch me with noble anger and let not women’s weapons water drops stain my man’s cheeks
no you unnatural hags i will have such revenges on you both that all the world shall —i will do such things — what they are yet i know not but they shall be the terrors of the earth
you think i’ll weep no i’ll not weep — storm and tempest i have full cause of weeping but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws or ere i’ll weep —o fool i shall go mad
exeunt lear gloucester kent and fool cornwall
let us withdraw ’twill be a storm
this house is little the old man and his people cannot be well bestow’d
’tis his own blame hath put himself from rest and must needs taste his folly
for his particular i’ll receive him gladly but not one follower
where is my lord of gloucester
followed the old man forth he is return’d
the king is in high rage
he calls to horse but will i know not whither
’tis best to give him way he leads himself
my lord entreat him by no means to stay
alack the night comes on and the high winds do sorely ruffle for many miles about there’s scarce a bush
o sir to wilful men the injuries that they themselves procure must be their schoolmasters
he is attended with a desperate train and what they may incense him to being apt to have his ear abus’d wisdom bids fear
shut up your doors my lord ’tis a wild night
my regan counsels well come out o’ the storm
a storm with thunder and lightning
enter kent and a gentleman severally
one minded like the weather most unquietly
contending with the fretful elements bids the wind blow the earth into the sea or swell the curled waters ’bove the main that things might change or cease tears his white hair which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage catch in their fury and make nothing of strives in his little world of man to outscorn the to and fro conflicting wind and rain
this night wherein the cub drawn bear would couch the lion and the belly pinched wolf keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs and bids what will take all
none but the fool who labours to out jest his heart struck injuries
sir i do know you and dare upon the warrant of my note commend a dear thing to you
there is division although as yet the face of it be cover’d with mutual cunning ’twixt albany and cornwall who have as who have not that their great stars throne’d and set high servants who seem no less which are to france the spies and speculations intelligent of our state
i am a gentleman of blood and breeding and from some knowledge and assurance offer this office to you
i will talk further with you
for confirmation that i am much more than my out wall open this purse and take what it contains
if you shall see cordelia as fear not but you shall show her this ring and she will tell you who your fellow is that yet you do not know
i will go seek the king
give me your hand have you no more to say
few words but to effect more than all yet that when we have found the king in which your pain that way i’ll this he that first lights on him holla the other
blow winds and crack your cheeks
you cataracts and hurricanoes spout till you have drench’d our steeples drown’d the cocks
you sulphurous and thought executing fires vaunt couriers to oak cleaving thunderbolts singe my white head
and thou all shaking thunder strike flat the thick rotundity o’ the world
crack nature’s moulds all germens spill at once that make ingrateful man
o nuncle court holy water in a dry house is better than this rain water out o’ door
good nuncle in and ask thy daughters blessing here’s a night pities neither wise men nor fools
nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters i tax not you you elements with unkindness
i never gave you kingdom call’d you children you owe me no subscription then let fall your horrible pleasure
here i stand your slave a poor infirm weak and despis’d old man but yet i call you servile ministers that will with two pernicious daughters join your high engender’d battles ’gainst a head so old and white as this
he that has a house to put’s head in has a good head piece
the codpiece that will house before the head has any the head and he shall louse so beggars marry many
the man that makes his toe what he his heart should make shall of a corn cry woe and turn his sleep to wake
for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass
no i will be the pattern of all patience i will say nothing
marry here’s grace and a codpiece that’s a wise man and a fool
things that love night love not such nights as these the wrathful skies gallow the very wanderers of the dark and make them keep their caves
since i was man such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder such groans of roaring wind and rain i never remember to have heard
man’s nature cannot carry th’affliction nor the fear
let the great gods that keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads find out their enemies now
tremble thou wretch that hast within thee undivulged crimes unwhipp’d of justice
hide thee thou bloody hand thou perjur’d and thou simular of virtue that art incestuous
caitiff to pieces shake that under covert and convenient seeming hast practis’d on man’s life close pent up guilts rive your concealing continents and cry these dreadful summoners grace
i am a man more sinn’d against than sinning
gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel some friendship will it lend you ’gainst the tempest repose you there whilst i to this hard house — more harder than the stones whereof ’tis rais’d which even but now demanding after you denied me to come in —return and force their scanted courtesy
where is this straw my fellow
the art of our necessities is strange that can make vile things precious
poor fool and knave i have one part in my heart that’s sorry yet for thee
singing he that has and a little tiny wit with heigh ho the wind and the rain must make content with his fortunes fit though the rain it raineth every day
come bring us to this hovel
this is a brave night to cool a courtezan
this prophecy merlin shall make for i live before his time
alack alack edmund i like not this unnatural dealing
when i desired their leave that i might pity him they took from me the use of mine own house charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for him or any way sustain him
there is division between the dukes and a worse matter than that i have received a letter this night —’tis dangerous to be spoken —i have locked the letter in my closet these injuries the king now bears will be revenged home there’s part of a power already footed we must incline to the king
i will look him and privily relieve him go you and maintain talk with the duke that my charity be not of him perceived if he ask for me i am ill and gone to bed
if i die for it as no less is threatened me the king my old master must be relieved
there is some strange thing toward edmund pray you be careful
this courtesy forbid thee shall the duke instantly know and of that letter too
this seems a fair deserving and must draw me that which my father loses no less than all the younger rises when the old doth fall
a part of the heath with a hovel
here is the place my lord good my lord enter the tyranny of the open night’s too rough for nature to endure
i had rather break mine own
thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin so ’tis to thee but where the greater malady is fix’d the lesser is scarce felt
thou’dst shun a bear but if thy flight lay toward the raging sea thou’dst meet the bear i’ the mouth
when the mind’s free the body’s delicate the tempest in my mind doth from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there
is it not as this mouth should tear this hand for lifting food to’t
but i will punish home no i will weep no more
in such a night to shut me out
pour on i will endure in such a night as this
your old kind father whose frank heart gave all o that way madness lies let me shun that no more of that
prythee go in thyself seek thine own ease this tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more
to the fool in boy go first
you houseless poverty nay get thee in
i’ll pray and then i’ll sleep
fool goes in poor naked wretches wheresoe’er you are that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides your loop’d and window’d raggedness defend you from seasons such as these
o i have ta’en too little care of this
take physic pomp expose thyself to feel what wretches feel that thou mayst shake the superflux to them and show the heavens more just
within fathom and half fathom and half
the fool runs out from the hovel fool
come not in here nuncle here’s a spirit
a spirit a spirit he says his name’s poor tom
what art thou that dost grumble there i’ the straw
enter edgar disguised as a madman
through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind
go to thy cold bed and warm thee
didst thou give all to thy two daughters
and art thou come to this
who gives anything to poor tom
whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame through ford and whirlpool o’er bog and quagmire that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew set ratsbane by his porridge made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting horse over four inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor
o do de do de do de
bless thee from whirlwinds star blasting and taking
do poor tom some charity whom the foul fiend vexes
there could i have him now and there —and there again and there
what have his daughters brought him to this pass
nay he reserv’d a blanket else we had been all shamed
now all the plagues that in the pendulous air hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters
nothing could have subdu’d nature to such a lowness but his unkind daughters
is it the fashion that discarded fathers should have thus little mercy on their flesh
’twas this flesh begot those pelican daughters
pillicock sat on pillicock hill alow alow loo loo
this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen
take heed o’ th’ foul fiend obey thy parents keep thy word justly swear not commit not with man’s sworn spouse set not thy sweet heart on proud array
a serving man proud in heart and mind that curled my hair wore gloves in my cap served the lust of my mistress’ heart and did the act of darkness with her swore as many oaths as i spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven
one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it
wine loved i deeply dice dearly and in woman out paramour’d the turk
false of heart light of ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox in stealth wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey
let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman
keep thy foot out of brothels thy hand out of plackets thy pen from lender’s book and defy the foul fiend
still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind says suum mun nonny
why thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies
is man no more than this
thou owest the worm no silk the beast no hide the sheep no wool the cat no perfume
thou art the thing itself unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare forked animal as thou art
prythee nuncle be contented ’tis a naughty night to swim in
now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart a small spark all the rest on’s body cold
look here comes a walking fire
this is the foul fiend flibbertigibbet he begins at curfew and walks till the first cock he gives the web and the pin squints the eye and makes the harelip mildews the white wheat and hurts the poor creature of earth
swithold footed thrice the old he met the nightmare and her nine fold bid her alight and her troth plight and aroint thee witch aroint thee
poor tom that eats the swimming frog the toad the todpole the wall newt and the water that in the fury of his heart when the foul fiend rages eats cow dung for sallets swallows the old rat and the ditch dog drinks the green mantle of the standing pool who is whipped from tithing to tithing and stocked punished and imprisoned who hath had three suits to his back six shirts to his body horse to ride and weapon to wear
but mice and rats and such small deer have been tom’s food for seven long year
what hath your grace no better company
the prince of darkness is a gentleman modo he’s call’d and mahu
our flesh and blood my lord is grown so vile that it doth hate what gets it
go in with me my duty cannot suffer t’obey in all your daughters’ hard commands though their injunction be to bar my doors and let this tyrannous night take hold upon you yet have i ventur’d to come seek you out and bring you where both fire and food is ready
first let me talk with this philosopher
what is the cause of thunder
good my lord take his offer go into the house
i’ll talk a word with this same learned theban
how to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin
let me ask you one word in private
importune him once more to go my lord his wits begin t’unsettle
he said it would be thus poor banish’d man
thou sayest the king grows mad i’ll tell thee friend i am almost mad myself
i had a son now outlaw’d from my blood he sought my life but lately very late i lov’d him friend no father his son dearer true to tell thee storm continues the grief hath craz’d my wits
in fellow there into the hovel keep thee warm
with him i will keep still with my philosopher
good my lord soothe him let him take the fellow
sirrah come on go along with us
child rowland to the dark tower came his word was still—fie foh and fum i smell the blood of a british man
exeunt scene v a room in gloucester’s castle
i will have my revenge ere i depart his house
how my lord i may be censured that nature thus gives way to loyalty something fears me to think of
i now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death but a provoking merit set a work by a reproveable badness in himself
how malicious is my fortune that i must repent to be just
this is the letter he spoke of which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of france
that this treason were not or not i the detector
go with me to the duchess
if the matter of this paper be certain you have mighty business in hand
true or false it hath made thee earl of gloucester
seek out where thy father is that he may be ready for our apprehension
aside if i find him comforting the king it will stuff his suspicion more fully
i will persever in my course of loyalty though the conflict be sore between that and my blood
i will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love
a chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle
enter gloucester lear kent fool and edgar
here is better than the open air take it thankfully
i will piece out the comfort with what addition i can i will not be long from you
all the power of his wits have given way to his impatience — the gods reward your kindness
frateretto calls me and tells me nero is an angler in the lake of darkness
pray innocent and beware the foul fiend
prythee nuncle tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman
no he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him
to have a thousand with red burning spits come hissing in upon ’em
the foul fiend bites my back
he’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf a horse’s health a boy’s love or a whore’s oath
it shall be done i will arraign them straight
to edgar come sit thou here most learned justicer to the fool thou sapient sir sit here
now you she foxes — edgar
look where he stands and glares
want’st thou eyes at trial madam
come o’er the bourn bessy to me
her boat hath a leak and she must not speak why she dares not come over to thee
the foul fiend haunts poor tom in the voice of a nightingale
hoppedance cries in tom’s belly for two white herring
croak not black angel i have no food for thee
stand you not so amaz’d will you lie down and rest upon the cushions
to edgar thou robed man of justice take thy place
to the fool and thou his yokefellow of equity bench by his side
to kent you are o’ the commission sit you too
sleepest or wakest thou jolly shepherd
thy sheep be in the corn and for one blast of thy minikin mouth thy sheep shall take no harm
i here take my oath before this honourable assembly she kicked the poor king her father
cry you mercy i took you for a joint stool
and here’s another whose warp’d looks proclaim what store her heart is made on
false justicer why hast thou let her ’scape
sir where is the patience now that you so oft have boasted to retain
aside my tears begin to take his part so much they mar my counterfeiting
the little dogs and all trey blanch and sweetheart see they bark at me
tom will throw his head at them
be thy mouth or black or white tooth that poisons if it bite mastiff greyhound mongrel grim hound or spaniel brach or him or bobtail tike or trundle tail tom will make them weep and wail for with throwing thus my head dogs leap the hatch and all are fled
come march to wakes and fairs and market towns
poor tom thy horn is dry
then let them anatomize regan see what breeds about her heart
is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts
to edgar you sir i entertain you for one of my hundred only i do not like the fashion of your garments
you’ll say they are persian but let them be changed
now good my lord lie here and rest awhile
make no noise make no noise draw the curtains
we’ll go to supper i’ the morning
and i’ll go to bed at noon
come hither friend where is the king my master
here sir but trouble him not his wits are gone
good friend i prythee take him in thy arms i have o’erheard a plot of death upon him there is a litter ready lay him in’t and drive towards dover friend where thou shalt meet both welcome and protection
take up thy master if thou shouldst dally half an hour his life with thine and all that offer to defend him stand in assured loss
take up take up and follow me that will to some provision give thee quick conduct
this rest might yet have balm’d thy broken sinews which if convenience will not allow stand in hard cure
come help to bear thy master to the fool thou must not stay behind
exeunt kent gloucester and the fool bearing off lear edgar
when we our betters see bearing our woes we scarcely think our miseries our foes
who alone suffers suffers most i’ the mind leaving free things and happy shows behind but then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip when grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
how light and portable my pain seems now when that which makes me bend makes the king bow he childed as i fathered
mark the high noises and thyself bewray when false opinion whose wrong thoughts defile thee in thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
what will hap more tonight safe ’scape the king
enter cornwall regan goneril edmund and servants
post speedily to my lord your husband show him this letter the army of france is landed
exeunt some of the servants regan
edmund keep you our sister company the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding
advise the duke where you are going to a most festinate preparation we are bound to the like
our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us
farewell dear sister farewell my lord of gloucester
my lord of gloucester hath convey’d him hence some five or six and thirty of his knights hot questrists after him met him at gate who with some other of the lord’s dependants are gone with him toward dover where they boast to have well armed friends
exeunt goneril edmund and oswald go seek the traitor gloucester pinion him like a thief bring him before us
exeunt other servants though well we may not pass upon his life without the form of justice yet our power shall do a courtesy to our wrath which men may blame but not control
good my friends consider you are my guests
do me no foul play friends
unmerciful lady as you are i’m none
villain thou shalt find— regan plucks his beard gloucester
by the kind gods ’tis most ignobly done to pluck me by the beard
so white and such a traitor
naughty lady these hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin will quicken and accuse thee
i am your host with robber’s hands my hospitable favours you should not ruffle thus
come sir what letters had you late from france
be simple answer’d for we know the truth
and what confederacy have you with the traitors late footed in the kingdom
to whose hands have you sent the lunatic king
i have a letter guessingly set down which came from one that’s of a neutral heart and not from one oppos’d
where hast thou sent the king
wast thou not charg’d at peril — cornwall
i am tied to the stake and i must stand the course
because i would not see thy cruel nails pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs
the sea with such a storm as his bare head in hell black night endur’d would have buoy’d up and quench’d the stelled fires yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain
if wolves had at thy gate howl’d that stern time thou shouldst have said ‘good porter turn the key ’ all cruels else subscrib’d but i shall see the winged vengeance overtake such children
upon these eyes of thine i’ll set my foot
gloucester is held down in his chair while cornwall plucks out one of his eyes and sets his foot on it gloucester
he that will think to live till he be old give me some help —o cruel
one side will mock another the other too
if you see vengeance— first servant
hold your hand my lord i have serv’d you ever since i was a child but better service have i never done you than now to bid you hold
if you did wear a beard upon your chin i’d shake it on this quarrel
draws and runs at him first servant
nay then come on and take the chance of anger
to another servant give me thy sword
snatches a sword comes behind and stabs him first servant
my lord you have one eye left to see some mischief on him
lest it see more prevent it
tears out gloucester’s other eye and throws it on the ground gloucester
edmund enkindle all the sparks of nature to quit this horrid act
thou call’st on him that hates thee it was he that made the overture of thy treasons to us who is too good to pity thee
kind gods forgive me that and prosper him
go thrust him out at gates and let him smell his way to dover
i have receiv’d a hurt follow me lady
throw this slave upon the dunghill
regan i bleed apace untimely comes this hurt give me your arm
exit cornwall led by regan servants unbind gloucester and lead him out second servant
i’ll never care what wickedness i do if this man come to good
if she live long and in the end meet the old course of death women will all turn monsters
let’s follow the old earl and get the bedlam to lead him where he would his roguish madness allows itself to anything
go thou i’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs to apply to his bleeding face
yet better thus and known to be contemn’d than still contemn’d and flatter’d
to be worst the lowest and most dejected thing of fortune stands still in esperance lives not in fear the lamentable change is from the best the worst returns to laughter
welcome then thou unsubstantial air that i embrace the wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst owes nothing to thy blasts
enter gloucester led by an old man
but that thy strange mutations make us hate thee life would not yield to age
o my good lord i have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years
away get thee away good friend be gone
thy comforts can do me no good at all thee they may hurt
i have no way and therefore want no eyes i stumbled when i saw
full oft ’tis seen our means secure us and our mere defects prove our commodities
o dear son edgar the food of thy abused father’s wrath
might i but live to see thee in my touch i’d say i had eyes again
who is’t can say ‘i am at the worst’
i am worse than e’er i was
aside and worse i may be yet
the worst is not so long as we can say ‘this is the worst ’ old man
he has some reason else he could not beg
i’ the last night’s storm i such a fellow saw which made me think a man a worm
my son came then into my mind and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him
as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport
bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow angering itself and others
if for my sake thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain i’ the way toward dover do it for ancient love and bring some covering for this naked soul which i’ll entreat to lead me
’tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind
do as i bid thee or rather do thy pleasure above the rest be gone
i’ll bring him the best ’parel that i have come on’t what will
aside i cannot daub it further
bless thy sweet eyes they bleed
know’st thou the way to dover
both stile and gate horseway and footpath
poor tom hath been scared out of his good wits
bless thee good man’s son from the foul fiend
five fiends have been in poor tom at once of lust as obidicut hobbididence prince of darkness mahu of stealing modo of murder flibbertigibbet of mopping and mowing who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women
here take this purse thou whom the heaven’s plagues have humbled to all strokes that i am wretched makes thee the happier
let the superfluous and lust dieted man that slaves your ordinance that will not see because he does not feel feel your power quickly so distribution should undo excess and each man have enough
there is a cliff whose high and bending head looks fearfully in the confined deep bring me but to the very brim of it and i’ll repair the misery thou dost bear with something rich about me from that place i shall no leading need
give me thy arm poor tom shall lead thee
before the duke of albany’s palace
enter goneril edmund oswald meeting them
i marvel our mild husband not met us on the way
madam within but never man so chang’d
i told him of the army that was landed he smil’d at it i told him you were coming his answer was ‘the worse ’ of gloucester’s treachery and of the loyal service of his son when i inform’d him then he call’d me sot and told me i had turn’d the wrong side out
what most he should dislike seems pleasant to him what like offensive
to edmund then shall you go no further
it is the cowish terror of his spirit that dares not undertake
he’ll not feel wrongs which tie him to an answer
our wishes on the way may prove effects
back edmund to my brother hasten his musters and conduct his powers
i must change names at home and give the distaff into my husband’s hands
this trusty servant shall pass between us
ere long you are like to hear if you dare venture in your own behalf a mistress’s command
giving a favour wear this spare speech decline your head
this kiss if it durst speak would stretch thy spirits up into the air
yours in the ranks of death
o the difference of man and man
to thee a woman’s services are due my fool usurps my body
i have been worth the whistle
you are not worth the dust which the rude wind blows in your face
i fear your disposition that nature which contemns its origin cannot be bordered certain in itself
she that herself will sliver and disbranch from her material sap perforce must wither and come to deadly use
no more the text is foolish
wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile filths savour but themselves
tigers not daughters what have you perform’d
a father and a gracious aged man whose reverence even the head lugg’d bear would lick most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
could my good brother suffer you to do it
a man a prince by him so benefitted
if that the heavens do not their visible spirits send quickly down to tame these vile offences it will come humanity must perforce prey on itself like monsters of the deep
that bear’st a cheek for blows a head for wrongs who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning thine honour from thy suffering that not know’st fools do those villains pity who are punish’d ere they have done their mischief
france spreads his banners in our noiseless land with plumed helm thy state begins to threat whilst thou a moral fool sitt’st still and criest ‘alack why does he so ’ albany
proper deformity seems not in the fiend so horrid as in woman
thou changed and self cover’d thing for shame
were’t my fitness to let these hands obey my blood
they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones

o my good lord the duke of cornwall’s dead slain by his servant going to put out the other eye of gloucester
a servant that he bred thrill’d with remorse oppos’d against the act bending his sword to his great master who thereat enrag’d flew on him and amongst them fell’d him dead but not without that harmful stroke which since hath pluck’d him after
this shows you are above you justicers that these our nether crimes so speedily can venge
this letter madam craves a speedy answer ’tis from your sister
aside one way i like this well but being widow and my gloucester with her may all the building in my fancy pluck upon my hateful life
another way the news is not so tart
where was his son when they did take his eyes
no my good lord i met him back again
’twas he inform’d against him and quit the house on purpose that their punishment might have the freer course
gloucester i live to thank thee for the love thou show’dst the king and to revenge thine eyes
come hither friend tell me what more thou know’st
why the king of france is so suddenly gone back know you no reason
something he left imperfect in the state which since his coming forth is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary
who hath he left behind him general
the mareschal of france monsieur la far
did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief
ay sir she took them read them in my presence and now and then an ample tear trill’d down her delicate cheek
it seem’d she was a queen over her passion who most rebel like sought to be king o’er her
not to a rage patience and sorrow strove who should express her goodliest
you have seen sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears were like a better day
those happy smilets that play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know what guests were in her eyes which parted thence as pearls from diamonds dropp’d
in brief sorrow would be a rarity most belov’d if all could so become it
faith once or twice she heav’d the name of ‘father’ pantingly forth as if it press’d her heart cried ‘sisters sisters
let pity not be believ’d ’ there she shook the holy water from her heavenly eyes and clamour master’d her then away she started to deal with grief alone
it is the stars the stars above us govern our conditions else one self mate and make could not beget such different issues
you spoke not with her since
was this before the king return’d
well sir the poor distressed lear’s i’ the town who sometime in his better tune remembers what we are come about and by no means will yield to see his daughter
a sovereign shame so elbows him
his own unkindness that stripp’d her from his benediction turn’d her to foreign casualties gave her dear rights to his dog hearted daughters these things sting his mind so venomously that burning shame detains him from cordelia
of albany’s and cornwall’s powers you heard not
well sir i’ll bring you to our master lear and leave you to attend him
some dear cause will in concealment wrap me up awhile when i am known aright you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance
i pray you go along with me
enter with drum and colours cordelia physician and soldiers
alack ’tis he why he was met even now as mad as the vex’d sea singing aloud crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds with harlocks hemlock nettles cuckoo flowers darnel and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn
a century send forth search every acre in the high grown field and bring him to our eye
exit an officer what can man’s wisdom in the restoring his bereaved sense he that helps him take all my outward worth
there is means madam our foster nurse of nature is repose the which he lacks that to provoke in him are many simples operative whose power will close the eye of anguish
all bless’d secrets all you unpublish’d virtues of the earth spring with my tears
be aidant and remediate in the good man’s distress
seek seek for him lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it
news madam the british powers are marching hitherward
our preparation stands in expectation of them
o dear father it is thy business that i go about therefore great france my mourning and important tears hath pitied
no blown ambition doth our arms incite but love dear love and our ag’d father’s right soon may i hear and see him
exeunt scene v a room in gloucester’s castle
but are my brother’s powers set forth
your sister is the better soldier
lord edmund spake not with your lord at home
what might import my sister’s letter to him
faith he is posted hence on serious matter
it was great ignorance gloucester’s eyes being out to let him live
where he arrives he moves all hearts against us
edmund i think is gone in pity of his misery to dispatch his nighted life moreover to descry the strength o’ th’enemy
i must needs after him madam with my letter
our troops set forth tomorrow stay with us the ways are dangerous
i may not madam my lady charg’d my duty in this business
why should she write to edmund
might not you transport her purposes by word
belike somethings i know not what i’ll love thee much
i know your lady does not love her husband i am sure of that and at her late being here she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks to noble edmund
i know you are of her bosom
i speak in understanding y’are i know’t therefore i do advise you take this note my lord is dead edmund and i have talk’d and more convenient is he for my hand than for your lady’s
if you do find him pray you give him this and when your mistress hears thus much from you i pray desire her call her wisdom to her
if you do chance to hear of that blind traitor preferment falls on him that cuts him off
would i could meet him madam
i should show what party i do follow
enter gloucester and edgar dressed like a peasant
when shall i come to the top of that same hill
you do climb up it now
hark do you hear the sea
why then your other senses grow imperfect by your eyes’ anguish
methinks thy voice is alter’d and thou speak’st in better phrase and matter than thou didst
y’are much deceiv’d in nothing am i chang’d but in my garments
come on sir here’s the place
how fearful and dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air show scarce so gross as beetles
half way down hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade
methinks he seems no bigger than his head
the fishermen that walk upon the beach appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark diminish’d to her cock her cock a buoy almost too small for sight the murmuring surge that on th’unnumber’d idle pebble chafes cannot be heard so high
i’ll look no more lest my brain turn and the deficient sight topple down headlong
you are now within a foot of th’extreme verge
for all beneath the moon would i not leap upright
here friend ’s another purse in it a jewel well worth a poor man’s taking
fairies and gods prosper it with thee
go thou further off bid me farewell and let me hear thee going
now fare ye well good sir
aside why i do trifle thus with his despair is done to cure it
this world i do renounce and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off if i could bear it longer and not fall to quarrel with your great opposeless wills my snuff and loathed part of nature should burn itself out
if edgar live o bless him
gloucester leaps and falls along and yet i know not how conceit may rob the treasury of life when life itself yields to the theft
had he been where he thought by this had thought been past
thus might he pass indeed yet he revives
hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air so many fathom down precipitating thou’dst shiver’d like an egg but thou dost breathe hast heavy substance bleed’st not speak’st art sound
ten masts at each make not the altitude which thou hast perpendicularly fell
but have i fall’n or no
from the dread summit of this chalky bourn
look up a height the shrill gorg’d lark so far cannot be seen or heard
is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit to end itself by death
’twas yet some comfort when misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage and frustrate his proud will
upon the crown o’ the cliff what thing was that which parted from you
as i stood here below methought his eyes were two full moons he had a thousand noses horns whelk’d and waved like the enraged sea
therefore thou happy father think that the clearest gods who make them honours of men’s impossibilities have preserv’d thee
i do remember now henceforth i’ll bear affliction till it do cry out itself ‘enough enough ’ and die
that thing you speak of i took it for a man often ’twould say ‘the fiend the fiend’ he led me to that place
enter lear fantastically dressed up with flowers
the safer sense will ne’er accommodate his master thus
no they cannot touch me for coining
nature’s above art in that respect
that fellow handles his bow like a crow keeper draw me a clothier’s yard
peace peace this piece of toasted cheese will do’t
there’s my gauntlet i’ll prove it on a giant
i’ the clout i’ the clout
they flattered me like a dog and told me i had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there
to say ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to everything i said ‘ay’ and ‘no’ to was no good divinity
when the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would not peace at my bidding there i found ’em there i smelt ’em out
go to they are not men o’ their words they told me i was everything ’tis a lie i am not ague proof
the trick of that voice i do well remember is’t not the king
when i do stare see how the subject quakes
thou shalt not die die for adultery
no the wren goes to’t and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight
let copulation thrive for gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets
behold yond simp’ring dame whose face between her forks presages snow that minces virtue and does shake the head to hear of pleasure’s name
the fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous appetite
down from the waist they are centaurs though women all above
but to the girdle do the gods inherit beneath is all the fiend’s there’s hell there’s darkness there is the sulphurous pit burning scalding stench consumption
give me an ounce of civet good apothecary to sweeten my imagination
o let me kiss that hand
let me wipe it first it smells of mortality
o ruin’d piece of nature this great world shall so wear out to naught
i remember thine eyes well enough
no do thy worst blind cupid i’ll not love
read thou this challenge mark but the penning of it
were all the letters suns i could not see one
i would not take this from report it is and my heart breaks at it
what with the case of eyes
o ho are you there with me
no eyes in your head nor no money in your purse
your eyes are in a heavy case your purse in a light yet you see how this world goes
a man may see how the world goes with no eyes
see how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief
hark in thine ear change places and handy dandy which is the justice which is the thief
thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar
and the creature run from the cur
there thou mightst behold the great image of authority a dog’s obeyed in office
thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
why dost thou lash that whore
strip thine own back thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind for which thou whipp’st her
through tatter’d clothes great vices do appear robes and furr’d gowns hide all
plate sin with gold and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks arm it in rags a pygmy’s straw does pierce it
none does offend none i say none i’ll able ’em take that of me my friend who have the power to seal the accuser’s lips
get thee glass eyes and like a scurvy politician seem to see the things thou dost not
now now now now pull off my boots harder harder so
if thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes
i know thee well enough thy name is gloucester
thou must be patient we came crying hither thou know’st the first time that we smell the air we wawl and cry
i will preach to thee mark
when we are born we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools

i’ll put’t in proof and when i have stol’n upon these son in laws then kill kill kill kill kill kill

near and on speedy foot the main descry stands on the hourly thought
i thank you sir that’s all

give me your hand i’ll lead you to some biding
hearty thanks the bounty and the benison of heaven to boot and boot

come father i’ll bestow you with a friend

lear on a bed asleep soft music playing physician gentleman and others attending
o thou good kent how shall i live and work to match thy goodness
my life will be too short and every measure fail me
to be acknowledg’d madam is o’erpaid
all my reports go with the modest truth nor more nor clipp’d but so
be better suited these weeds are memories of those worser hours i prythee put them off
pardon dear madam yet to be known shortens my made intent
my boon i make it that you know me not till time and i think meet
then be’t so my good lord

o you kind gods cure this great breach in his abused nature
the untun’d and jarring senses o wind up of this child changed father
so please your majesty that we may wake the king he hath slept long
be govern’d by your knowledge and proceed i’ the sway of your own will
in the heaviness of sleep we put fresh garments on him
be by good madam when we do awake him i doubt not of his temperance
restoration hang thy medicine on my lips and let this kiss repair those violent harms that my two sisters have in thy reverence made
had you not been their father these white flakes did challenge pity of them
was this a face to be oppos’d against the warring winds
to stand against the deep dread bolted thunder
in the most terrible and nimble stroke of quick cross lightning
mine enemy’s dog though he had bit me should have stood that night against my fire and wast thou fain poor father to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw
’tis wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded all
you do me wrong to take me out o’ the grave
thou art a soul in bliss but i am bound upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears do scald like molten lead
you are a spirit i know when did you die
he’s scarce awake let him alone awhile
i should e’en die with pity to see another thus
i know not what to say
i will not swear these are my hands let’s see i feel this pin prick
would i were assur’d of my condition
o look upon me sir and hold your hands in benediction o’er me
no sir you must not kneel
pray do not mock me i am a very foolish fond old man fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less and to deal plainly i fear i am not in my perfect mind
methinks i should know you and know this man yet i am doubtful for i am mainly ignorant what place this is and all the skill i have remembers not these garments nor i know not where i did lodge last night
do not laugh at me for as i am a man i think this lady to be my child cordelia
i pray weep not if you have poison for me i will drink it
i know you do not love me for your sisters have as i do remember done me wrong
you have some cause they have not
be comforted good madam the great rage you see is kill’d in him and yet it is danger to make him even o’er the time he has lost
desire him to go in trouble him no more till further settling

to both these sisters have i sworn my love each jealous of the other as the stung are of the adder
which of them shall i take
neither can be enjoy’d if both remain alive
to take the widow exasperates makes mad her sister goneril and hardly shall i carry out my side her husband being alive
now then we’ll use his countenance for the battle which being done let her who would be rid of him devise his speedy taking off

come let’s away to prison we two alone will sing like birds i’ the cage when thou dost ask me blessing i’ll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness
so we’ll live and pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh at gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues talk of court news and we’ll talk with them too who loses and who wins who’s in who’s out and take upon’s the mystery of things as if we were god’s spies
and we’ll wear out in a wall’d prison packs and sects of great ones that ebb and flow by the moon

sir i thought it fit to send the old and miserable king to some retention and appointed guard whose age has charms in it whose title more to pluck the common bosom on his side and turn our impress’d lances in our eyes which do command them
with him i sent the queen my reason all the same and they are ready tomorrow or at further space to appear where you shall hold your session
at this time we sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend and the best quarrels in the heat are curs’d by those that feel their sharpness
the question of cordelia and her father requires a fitter place
sir by your patience i hold you but a subject of this war not as a brother
that’s as we list to grace him
methinks our pleasure might have been demanded ere you had spoke so far
he led our powers bore the commission of my place and person the which immediacy may well stand up and call itself your brother

say thou ‘no ’ this sword this arm and my best spirits are bent to prove upon thy heart whereto i speak thou liest
in wisdom i should ask thy name but since thy outside looks so fair and warlike and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes what safe and nicely i might well delay by rule of knighthood i disdain and spurn
back do i toss those treasons to thy head with the hell hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart which for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise this sword of mine shall give them instant way where they shall rest for ever

if thou’rt noble i do forgive thee
i am no less in blood than thou art edmund if more the more thou hast wrong’d me
my name is edgar and thy father’s son

let sorrow split my heart if ever i did hate thee or thy father
how have you known the miseries of your father
list a brief tale and when ’tis told o that my heart would burst
the bloody proclamation to escape that follow’d me so near —o our lives’ sweetness
that with the pain of death we’d hourly die rather than die at once —taught me to shift into a madman’s rags t’assume a semblance that very dogs disdain’d and in this habit met i my father with his bleeding rings their precious stones new lost became his guide led him begg’d for him sav’d him from despair never —o fault —reveal’d myself unto him until some half hour past when i was arm’d not sure though hoping of this good success i ask’d his blessing and from first to last told him my pilgrimage
but his flaw’d heart alack too weak the conflict to support
’twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief burst smilingly
this speech of yours hath mov’d me and shall perchance do good but speak you on you look as you had something more to say
if there be more more woeful hold it in for i am almost ready to dissolve hearing of this
this would have seem’d a period to such as love not sorrow but another to amplify too much would make much more and top extremity
whilst i was big in clamour came there a man who having seen me in my worst estate shunn’d my abhorr’d society but then finding who ’twas that so endur’d with his strong arms he fastened on my neck and bellow’d out as he’d burst heaven threw him on my father told the most piteous tale of lear and him that ever ear receiv’d which in recounting his grief grew puissant and the strings of life began to crack

had i your tongues and eyes i’ld use them so that heaven’s vault should crack
i know when one is dead and when one lives she’s dead as earth
lend me a looking glass if that her breath will mist or stain the stone why then she lives
if it be so it is a chance which does redeem all sorrows that ever i have felt
a plague upon you murderers traitors all
i might have sav’d her now she’s gone for ever
her voice was ever soft gentle and low an excellent thing in woman
i kill’d the slave that was a hanging thee
’tis true my lords he did
i have seen the day with my good biting falchion i would have made them skip
i am old now and these same crosses spoil me
mine eyes are not o’ the best i’ll tell you straight
if fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated one of them we behold
he’s a good fellow i can tell you that he’ll strike and quickly too
no my good lord i am the very man
that from your first of difference and decay have follow’d your sad steps
your eldest daughters have fordone themselves and desperately are dead
he knows not what he says and vain is it that we present us to him
you lords and noble friends know our intent
what comfort to this great decay may come shall be applied for us we will resign during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power to edgar and kent you to your rights with boot and such addition as your honours have more than merited
all friends shall taste the wages of their virtue and all foes the cup of their deservings
and my poor fool is hang’d
why should a dog a horse a rat have life and thou no breath at all
thou’lt come no more never never never never never
look on her look her lips look there look there
vex not his ghost o let him pass
he hates him that would upon the rack of this rough world stretch him out longer
the wonder is he hath endur’d so long he but usurp’d his life
our present business is general woe
to edgar and kent friends of my soul you twain rule in this realm and the gor’d state sustain
i have a journey sir shortly to go my master calls me i must not say no
the weight of this sad time we must obey speak what we feel not what we ought to say
the oldest hath borne most we that are young shall never see so much nor live so long

the king s park enter the king berowne longaville and dumain king
let fame that all hunt after in their lives live regist red upon our brazen tombs and then grace us in the disgrace of death when spite of cormorant devouring time th endeavour of this present breath may buy that honour which shall bate his scythe s keen edge and make us heirs of all eternity
therefore brave conquerors for so you are that war against your own affections and the huge army of the world s desires our late edict shall strongly stand in force navarre shall be the wonder of the world our court shall be a little academe still and contemplative in living art
you three berowne dumain and longaville have sworn for three years term to live with me my fellow scholars and to keep those statutes that are recorded in this schedule here
your oaths are pass d and now subscribe your names that his own hand may strike his honour down that violates the smallest branch herein
if you are arm d to do as sworn to do subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
i am resolv d tis but a three years fast
the mind shall banquet though the body pine
fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
my loving lord dumain is mortified
the grosser manner of these world s delights he throws upon the gross world s baser slaves to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die with all these living in philosophy
i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years
but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there
o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep
your oath is pass d to pass away from these
let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years space
you swore to that berowne and to the rest
by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest
what is the end of study let me know
why that to know which else we should not know
things hid and barr d you mean from common sense
ay that is study s god like recompense
come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thus to study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth
if study s gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know
swear me to this and i will ne er say no
these be the stops that hinder study quite and train our intellects to vain delight
why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchas d doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by
study is like the heaven s glorious sun that will not be deep search d with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books
these earthly godfathers of heaven s lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are
too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name
how well he s read to reason against reading
proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
the spring is near when green geese are a breeding
fit in his place and time
berowne is like an envious sneaping frost that bites the first born infants of the spring
well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing
why should i joy in any abortive birth
at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in may s new fangled shows but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb o er the house to unlock the little gate
well sit out go home berowne adieu
no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident i ll keep what i have swore and bide the penance of each three years day
give me the paper let me read the same and to the strictest decrees i ll write my name
how well this yielding rescues thee from shame
that no woman shall come within a mile of my court hath this been proclaimed
reads on pain of losing her tongue
to fright them hence with that dread penalty
if any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise
this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french king s daughter with yourself to speak a mild of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine to her decrepit sick and bedrid father therefore this article is made in vain or vainly comes th admired princess hither
so study evermore is over shot
while it doth study to have what it would it doth forget to do the thing it should and when it hath the thing it hunteth most tis won as towns with fire so won so lost
we must of force dispense with this decree she must lie here on mere necessity
necessity will make us all forsworn three thousand times within this three years space for every man with his affects is born not by might mast red but by special grace
if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity
so to the laws at large i write my name subscribes and he that breaks them in the least degree stands in attainder of eternal shame
suggestions are to other as to me but i believe although i seem so loath i am the last that will last keep his oath
but is there no quick recreation granted
our court you know is haunted with a refined traveller of spain a man in all the world s new fashion planted that hath a mint of phrases in his brain one who the music of his own vain tongue doth ravish like enchanting harmony a man of complements whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny
this child of fancy that armado hight for interim to our studies shall relate in high born words the worth of many a knight from tawny spain lost in the world s debate
how you delight my lords i know not i but i protest i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy
armado is a most illustrious wight a man of fire new words fashion s own knight
costard the swain and he shall be our sport and so to study three years is but short
enter dull a constable with a letter and costard dull
which is the duke s own person
i myself reprehend his own person for i am his grace s farborough but i would see his own person in flesh and blood
there s villainy abroad this letter will tell you more
sir the contempts thereof are as touching me
a letter from the magnificent armado
how low soever the matter i hope in god for high words
a high hope for a low heaven
to hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to forbear both
well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness
the matter is to me sir as concerning jaquenetta
the manner of it is i was taken with the manner
in manner and form following sir all those three i was seen with her in the manor house sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which put together is in manner and form following
now sir for the manner it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman
for the form in some form
as it shall follow in my correction and god defend the right
will you hear this letter with attention
as we would hear an oracle
such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
reads great deputy the welkin s vicegerent and sole dominator of navarre my soul s earth s god and body s fost ring patron costard
not a word of costard yet
it may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but so
be to me and every man that dares not fight
of other men s secrets i beseech you
reads so it is besieged with sable coloured melancholy i did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health giving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk
about the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper
so much for the time when
which i mean i upon it is ycleped thy park
where i mean i did encounter that obscene and most prepost rous event that draweth from my snow white pen the ebon coloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seest
it standeth north north east and by east from the west corner of thy curious knotted garden
there did i see that low spirited swain that base minnow of thy mirth costard
that unlettered small knowing soul costard
which as i remember hight costard costard
sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon which with o with but with this i passion to say wherewith costard
with a child of our grandmother eve a female or for thy more sweet understanding a woman
him i as my ever esteemed duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment by thy sweet grace s officer antony dull a man of good repute carriage bearing and estimation
me an t shall please you i am antony dull
for jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel called which i apprehended with the aforesaid swain i keep her as a vessel of thy law s fury and shall at the least of thy sweet notice bring her to trial
thine in all compliments of devoted and heart burning heat of duty don adriano de armado
this is not so well as i look d for but the best that ever i heard
ay the best for the worst
but sirrah what say you to this
i do confess much of the hearing it but little of the marking of it
it was proclaimed a year s imprisonment to be taken with a wench
i was taken with none sir i was taken with a damsel
this was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
it is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin
if it were i deny her virginity i was taken with a maid
this maid not serve your turn sir
this maid will serve my turn sir
sir i will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week with bran and water
i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
and don armado shall be your keeper
my lord berowne see him delivered o er and go we lords to put in practice that which each to other hath so strongly sworn
exeunt king longaville and dumain berowne
i ll lay my head to any good man s hat these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn
i suffer for the truth sir for true it is i was taken with jaquenetta and jaquenetta is a true girl and therefore welcome the sour cup of prosperity
affliction may one day smile again and till then sit thee down sorrow
the park enter armado and moth his page armado
boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy
a great sign sir that he will look sad
why sadness is one and the self same thing dear imp
no no o lord sir no
how canst thou part sadness and melancholy my tender juvenal
by a familiar demonstration of the working my tough signior
i spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tender
and i tough signior as an appertinent title to your old time which we may name tough
i pretty and my saying apt
or i apt and my saying pretty
speak you this in my praise master
i will praise an eel with the same praise
i do say thou art quick in answers thou heat st my blood
i love not to be cross d
aside he speaks the mere contrary crosses love not him
i have promised to study three years with the duke
you may do it in an hour sir
how many is one thrice told
i am ill at reck ning it fitteth the spirit of a tapster
you are a gentleman and a gamester sir
i confess both they are both the varnish of a complete man
then i am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce ace amounts to
it doth amount to one more than two
which the base vulgar do call three
why sir is this such a piece of study
now here is three studied ere ye ll thrice wink and how easy it is to put years to the word three and study three years in two words the dancing horse will tell you
aside to prove you a cipher
i will hereupon confess i am in love
and as it is base for a soldier to love so am i in love with a base wench
if drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it i would take desire prisoner and ransom him to any french courtier for a new devis d curtsy
i think scorn to sigh methinks i should out swear cupid
comfort me boy what great men have been in love
more authority dear boy name more and sweet my child let them be men of good repute and carriage
samson master he was a man of good carriage great carriage for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter and he was in love
i do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates
who was samson s love my dear moth
of all the four or the three or the two or one of the four
tell me precisely of what complexion
of the sea water green sir
is that one of the four complexions
as i have read sir and the best of them too
green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love of that colour methinks samson had small reason for it
he surely affected her for her wit
it was so sir for she had a green wit
my love is most immaculate white and red
most maculate thoughts master are mask d under such colours
my father s wit my mother s tongue assist me
sweet invocation of a child most pretty and pathetical
if she be made of white and red her faults will ne er be known for blushing cheeks by faults are bred and fears by pale white shown
then if she fear or be to blame by this you shall not know for still her cheeks possess the same which native she doth owe
a dangerous rhyme master against the reason of white and red
is there not a ballad boy of the king and the beggar
the world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since but i think now tis not to be found or if it were it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune
i will have that subject newly writ o er that i may example my digression by some mighty precedent
boy i do love that country girl that i took in the park with the rational hind costard she deserves well
aside to be whipt and yet a better love than my master
sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love
and that s great marvel loving a light wench
forbear till this company be past
enter dull costard and jaquenetta dull
sir the duke s pleasure is that you keep costard safe and you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance but a must fast three days a week
for this damsel i must keep her at the park she is allow d for the day woman
i do betray myself with blushing
i will visit thee at the lodge
i know where it is situate
villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned
well sir i hope when i do it i shall do it on a full stomach
i am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but lightly rewarded
take away this villain shut him up
let me not be pent up sir i will fast being loose
no sir that were fast and loose
well if ever i do see the merry days of desolation that i have seen some shall see
nay nothing master moth but what they look upon
it is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore i will say nothing
i thank god i have as little patience as another man and therefore i can be quiet
i do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread
i shall be forsworn which is a great argument of falsehood if i love
and how can that be true love which is falsely attempted
love is a familiar love is a devil
there is no evil angel but love
yet was samson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
cupid s butt shaft is too hard for hercules club and therefore too much odds for a spaniard s rapier
the first and second cause will not serve my turn the passado he respects not the duello he regards not his disgrace is to be called boy but his glory is to subdue men
adieu valour rust rapier be still drum for your manager is in love yea he loveth
assist me some extemporal god of rhyme for i am sure i shall turn sonnet
devise wit write pen for i am for whole volumes in folio
the park enter the princess of france with three attending ladies rosaline maria katharine boyet and two other lords boyet
now madam summon up your dearest spirits
consider who the king your father sends to whom he sends and what s his embassy yourself held precious in the world s esteem to parley with the sole inheritor of all perfections that a man may owe matchless navarre the plea of no less weight than aquitaine a dowry for a queen
be now as prodigal of all dear grace as nature was in making graces dear when she did starve the general world beside and prodigally gave them all to you
good lord boyet my beauty though but mean needs not the painted flourish of your praise
beauty is bought by judgment of the eye not utt red by base sale of chapmen s tongues i am less proud to hear you tell my worth than you much willing to be counted wise in spending your wit in the praise of mine
but now to task the tasker good boyet you are not ignorant all telling fame doth noise abroad navarre hath made a vow till painful study shall outwear three years no woman may approach his silent court
therefore to s seemeth it a needful course before we enter his forbidden gates to know his pleasure and in that behalf bold of your worthiness we single you as our best moving fair solicitor
tell him the daughter of the king of france on serious business craving quick dispatch importunes personal conference with his grace
haste signify so much while we attend like humble visag d suitors his high will
proud of employment willingly i go
all pride is willing pride and yours is so
exit boyet who are the votaries my loving lords that are vow fellows with this virtuous duke
i know him madam at a marriage feast between lord perigort and the beauteous heir of jaques falconbridge solemnized in normandy saw i this longaville
a man of sovereign parts peerless esteem d well fitted in arts glorious in arms nothing becomes him ill that he would well
the only soil of his fair virtue s gloss if virtue s gloss will stain with any soil is a sharp wit match d with too blunt a will whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills it should none spare that come within his power
some merry mocking lord belike is t so
they say so most that most his humours know
such short liv d wits do wither as they grow
the young dumain a well accomplish d youth of all that virtue love for virtue loved most power to do most harm least knowing ill for he hath wit to make an ill shape good and shape to win grace though he had no wit
i saw him at the duke alencon s once and much too little of that good i saw is my report to his great worthiness
another of these students at that time was there with him if i have heard a truth
berowne they call him but a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth i never spent an hour s talk withal
his eye begets occasion for his wit for every object that the one doth catch the other turns to a mirth moving jest which his fair tongue conceit s expositor delivers in such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished so sweet and voluble is his discourse
are they all in love that every one her own hath garnished with such bedecking ornaments of praise
re enter boyet princess of france
navarre had notice of your fair approach and he and his competitors in oath were all address d to meet you gentle lady before i came
marry thus much i have learnt he rather means to lodge you in the field like one that comes here to besiege his court than seek a dispensation for his oath to let you enter his unpeopled house
the ladies in waiting mask enter king longaville dumain berowne and attendants here comes navarre
fair princess welcome to the court of navarre
fair i give you back again and welcome i have not yet
the roof of this court is too high to be yours and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine
you shall be welcome madam to my court
i will be welcome then conduct me thither
hear me dear lady i have sworn an oath princess of france
not for the world fair madam by my will
why will shall break it will and nothing else
your ladyship is ignorant what it is
were my lord so his ignorance were wise where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
i hear your grace hath sworn out house keeping
tis deadly sin to keep that oath my lord and sin to break it
but pardon me i am too sudden bold to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming and suddenly resolve me in my suit
madam i will if suddenly i may
you will the sooner that i were away for you ll prove perjur d if you make me stay
did not i dance with you in brabant once
did not i dance with you in brabant once
how needless was it then to ask the question
you must not be so quick
tis long of you that spur me with such questions
your wit s too hot it speeds too fast twill tire
not till it leave the rider in the mire
the hour that fools should ask
fair fall the face it covers
nay then will i be gone
madam your father here doth intimate the payment of a hundred thousand crowns being but the one half of an entire sum disbursed by my father in his wars
but say that he or we as neither have receiv d that sum yet there remains unpaid a hundred thousand more in surety of the which one part of aquitaine is bound to us although not valued to the money s worth
if then the king your father will restore but that one half which is unsatisfied we will give up our right in aquitaine and hold fair friendship with his majesty
but that it seems he little purposeth for here he doth demand to have repaid a hundred thousand crowns and not demands on payment of a hundred thousand crowns to have his title live in aquitaine which we much rather had depart withal and have the money by our father lent than aquitaine so gelded as it is
dear princess were not his requests so far from reason s yielding your fair self should make a yielding gainst some reason in my breast and go well satisfied to france again
you do the king my father too much wrong and wrong the reputation of your name in so unseeming to confess receipt of that which hath so faithfully been paid
i do protest i never heard of it and if you prove it i ll repay it back or yield up aquitaine
boyet you can produce acquittances for such a sum from special officers of charles his father
so please your grace the packet is not come where that and other specialties are bound to morrow you shall have a sight of them
it shall suffice me at which interview all liberal reason i will yield unto
meantime receive such welcome at my hand as honour without breach of honour may make tender of to thy true worthiness
you may not come fair princess within my gates but here without you shall be so receiv d as you shall deem yourself lodg d in my heart though so denied fair harbour in my house
your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
to morrow shall we visit you again
sweet health and fair desires consort your grace
thy own wish wish i thee in every place
lady i will commend you to mine own heart
pray you do my commendations i would be glad to see it
i would you heard it groan
will you prick t with your eye
sir i pray you a word what lady is that same
the heir of alencon katharine her name
i beseech you a word what is she in the white
a woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
she hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
her mother s i have heard
god s blessing on your beard
good sir be not offended she is an heir of falconbridge
she is a most sweet lady
not unlike sir that may be
what s her name in the cap
to her will sir or so
farewell to me sir and welcome to you
that last is berowne the merry mad cap lord not a word with him but a jest
and every jest but a word
it was well done of you to take him at his word
i was as willing to grapple as he was to board
no sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
you sheep and i pasture shall that finish the jest
so you grant pasture for me
not so gentle beast my lips are no common though several they be
good wits will be jangling but gentles agree this civil war of wits were much better used on navarre and his book men for here tis abused
if my observation which very seldom lies by the heart s still rhetoric disclosed with eyes deceive me not now navarre is infected
with that which we lovers entitle affected
why all his behaviours did make their retire to the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
his heart like an agate with your print impressed proud with his form in his eye pride expressed his tongue all impatient to speak and not see did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be all senses to that sense did make their repair to feel only looking on fairest of fair
methought all his senses were lock d in his eye as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy who tend ring their own worth from where they were glass d did point you to buy them along as you pass d
his face s own margent did quote such amazes that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
i ll give you aquitaine and all that is his an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
but to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos d i only have made a mouth of his eye by adding a tongue which i know will not lie
thou art an old love monger and speakest skilfully
he is cupid s grandfather and learns news of him
then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim
do you hear my mad wenches
ay our way to be gone
you are too hard for me
the park enter armado and moth armado
warble child make passionate my sense of hearing
go tenderness of years take this key give enlargement to the swain bring him festinately hither i must employ him in a letter to my love
master will you win your love with a french brawl
these are complements these are humours these betray nice wenches that would be betrayed without these and make them men of note do you note me that most are affected to these
how hast thou purchased this experience
call st thou my love hobby horse
no master the hobby horse is but a colt and your love perhaps a hackney
but have you forgot your love
by heart and in heart boy
and out of heart master all those three i will prove
a man if i live and this by in and without upon the instant
by heart you love her because your heart cannot come by her in heart you love her because your heart is in love with her and out of heart you love her being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her
and three times as much more and yet nothing at all
fetch hither the swain he must carry me a letter
a message well sympathiz d a horse to be ambassador for an ass
marry sir you must send the ass upon the horse for he is very slow gaited
the way is but short away
is not lead a metal heavy dull and slow
minime honest master or rather master no
you are too swift sir to say so is that lead slow which is fir d from a gun
he reputes me a cannon and the bullet that s he i shoot thee at the swain
a most acute juvenal volable and free of grace
by thy favour sweet welkin i must sigh in thy face most rude melancholy valour gives thee place
re enter moth with costard moth
here s a costard broken in a shin
some enigma some riddle come thy l envoy begin
no egma no riddle no l envoy no salve in the mail sir
o sir plantain a plain plantain no l envoy no l envoy no salve sir but a plantain
by virtue thou enforcest laughter thy silly thought my spleen the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling
doth the inconsiderate take salve for l envoy and the word l envoy for a salve
do the wise think them other
is not l envoy a salve
no page it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain
i will example it the fox the ape and the humble bee were still at odds being but three
i will add the l envoy
the fox the ape and the humble bee were still at odds being but three
until the goose came out of door and stay d the odds by adding four
now will i begin your moral and do you follow with my l envoy
the fox the ape and the humble bee were still at odds being but three
until the goose came out of door staying the odds by adding four
a good l envoy ending in the goose would you desire more
the boy hath sold him a bargain a goose that s flat
sir your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat
to sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose let me see a fat l envoy ay that s a fat goose
by saying that a costard was broken in a shin
then call d you for the l envoy
true and i for a plantain
thus came your argument in then the boy s fat l envoy the goose that you bought and he ended the market
but tell me how was there a costard broken in a shin
thou hast no feeling of it moth i will speak that l envoy
i costard running out that was safely within fell over the threshold and broke my shin
we will talk no more of this matter
till there be more matter in the shin
o marry me to one frances

nay to be perjur d which is worst of all and among three to love the worst of all a whitely wanton with a velvet brow with two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes ay and by heaven one that will do the deed though argus were her eunuch and her guard

the park enter the princess rosaline maria katharine boyet lords attendants and a forester princess of france
was that the king that spurr d his horse so hard against the steep uprising of the hill
i know not but i think it was not he
whoe er a was a show d a mounting mind
well lords to day we shall have our dispatch on saturday we will return to france
then forester my friend where is the bush that we must stand and play the murderer in
hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice a stand where you may make the fairest shoot
i thank my beauty i am fair that shoot and thereupon thou speak st the fairest shoot
pardon me madam for i meant not so
first praise me and again say no
nay never paint me now where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
here good my glass take this for telling true giving him money fair payment for foul words is more than due
nothing but fair is that which you inherit
see see my beauty will be sav d by merit
o heresy in fair fit for these days
a giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
now mercy goes to kill and shooting well is then accounted ill thus will i save my credit in the shoot not wounding pity would not let me do t if wounding then it was to show my skill that more for praise than purpose meant to kill
and out of question so it is sometimes glory grows guilty of detested crimes when for fame s sake for praise an outward part we bend to that the working of the heart as i for praise alone now seek to spill the poor deer s blood that my heart means no ill boyet
do not curst wives hold that self sovereignty only for praise sake when they strive to be lords o er their lords
only for praise and praise we may afford to any lady that subdues a lord
here comes a member of the commonwealth
pray you which is the head lady
thou shalt know her fellow by the rest that have no heads
which is the greatest lady the highest
it is so truth is truth
an your waist mistress were as slender as my wit one o these maids girdles for your waist should be fit
are not you the chief woman
i have a letter from monsieur berowne to one lady rosaline
he s a good friend of mine
this letter is mistook it importeth none here
we will read it i swear
break the neck of the wax and every one give ear
reads by heaven that thou art fair is most infallible true that thou art beauteous truth itself that thou art lovely
more fairer than fair beautiful than beauteous truer than truth itself have commiseration on thy heroical vassal
the magnanimous and most illustrate king cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar zenelophon and he it was that might rightly say veni vidi vici which to annothanize in the vulgar o base and obscure vulgar videlicet he came saw and overcame
he came one saw two overcame three
why did he come to see
why did he see to overcome
to whom came he to the beggar
the conclusion is victory on whose side the king s
the captive is enrich d on whose side the beggar s
the catastrophe is a nuptial on whose side the king s
no on both in one or one in both
i am the king for so stands the comparison thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy lowliness
what shalt thou exchange for rags robes for tittles titles for thyself
thus expecting thy reply i profane my lips on thy foot my eyes on thy picture and my heart on thy every part
thine in the dearest design of industry don adriano de armado
thus dost thou hear the nemean lion roar gainst thee thou lamb that standest as his prey submissive fall his princely feet before and he from forage will incline to play
but if thou strive poor soul what are thou then
food for his rage repasture for his den
what plume of feathers is he that indited this letter
i am much deceived but i remember the style
else your memory is bad going o er it erewhile
this armado is a spaniard that keeps here in court a phantasime a monarcho and one that makes sport to the prince and his book mates
to whom shouldst thou give it
from my lord to my lady
from which lord to which lady
from my lord berowne a good master of mine to a lady of france that he call d rosaline
to rosaline here sweet put up this twill be thine another day
shall i teach you to know
why she that bears the bow
my lady goes to kill horns but if thou marry hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry
well then i am the shooter
if we choose by the horns yourself come not near
you still wrangle with her boyet and she strikes at the brow
but she herself is hit lower
shall i come upon thee with an old saying that was a man when king pepin of france was a little boy as touching the hit it
so i may answer thee with one as old that was a woman when queen guinever of britain was a little wench as touching the hit it
singing thou canst not hit it hit it hit it thou canst not hit it my good man
an i cannot cannot cannot an i cannot another can
a mark marvellous well shot for they both did hit it
let the mark have a prick in t to mete at if it may be
i faith your hand is out
indeed a must shoot nearer or he ll ne er hit the clout
an if my hand be out then belike your hand is in
then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin
come come you talk greasily your lips grow foul
she s too hard for you at pricks sir challenge her to bowl
i fear too much rubbing good night my good owl
by my soul a swain a most simple clown
how the ladies and i have put him down
o my troth most sweet jests most incony vulgar wit
when it comes so smoothly off so obscenely as it were so fit
armado a th t one side o a most dainty man
to see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan
to see him kiss his hand and how most sweetly a will swear
and his page a t other side that handful of wit
ah heavens it is a most pathetical nit
the park from the shooting within enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull nathaniel
very reverent sport truly and done in the testimony of a good conscience
the deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe as the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo the sky the welkin the heaven and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra the soil the land the earth
truly master holofernes the epithets are sweetly varied like a scholar at the least but sir i assure ye it was a buck of the first head
twas not a haud credo twas a pricket
yet a kind of insinuation as it were in via in way of explication facere as it were replication or rather ostentare to show as it were his inclination after his undressed unpolished uneducated unpruned untrained or rather unlettered or ratherest unconfirmed fashion to insert again my haud credo for a deer
i said the deer was not a haud credo twas a pricket
o thou monster ignorance how deformed dost thou look
sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book he hath not eat paper as it were he hath not drunk ink his intellect is not replenished he is only an animal only sensible in the duller parts and such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should be which we of taste and feeling are for those parts that do fructify in us more than he
for as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool so were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
but omne bene say i being of an old father s mind many can brook the weather that love not the wind
you two are book men can you tell me by your wit what was a month old at cain s birth that s not five weeks old as yet
dictynna goodman dull dictynna goodman dull
a title to phoebe to luna to the moon
the moon was a month old when adam was no more and raught not to five weeks when he came to five score
th allusion holds in the exchange
tis true indeed the collusion holds in the exchange
i say th allusion holds in the exchange
and i say the polusion holds in the exchange for the moon is never but a month old and i say beside that twas a pricket that the princess kill d
sir nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer
and to humour the ignorant call the deer the princess kill d a pricket
perge good master holofernes perge so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility
i will something affect the letter for it argues facility
the preyful princess pierc d and prick d a pretty pleasing pricket
some say a sore but not a sore till now made sore with shooting
the dogs did yell put el to sore then sorel jumps from thicket or pricket sore or else sorel the people fall a hooting
if sore be sore then l to sore makes fifty sores o sorel
of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l nathaniel
aside if a talent be a claw look how he claws him with a talent
this is a gift that i have simple simple a foolish extravagant spirit full of forms figures shapes objects ideas apprehensions motions revolutions
these are begot in the ventricle of memory nourish d in the womb of pia mater and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion
but the gift is good in those in whom it is acute and i am thankful for it
sir i praise the lord for you and so may my parishioners for their sons are well tutor d by you and their daughters profit very greatly under you
you are a good member of the commonwealth
mehercle if their sons be ingenious they shall want no instruction if their daughters be capable i will put it to them but vir sapit qui pauca loquitur
god give you good morrow master person
and if one should be pierc d which is the one
marry master schoolmaster he that is likest to a hogshead
a good lustre of conceit in a turf of earth fire enough for a flint pearl enough for a swine tis pretty it is well
good master parson be so good as read me this letter it was given me by costard and sent me from don armado
fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra ruminat and so forth
i may speak of thee as the traveller doth of venice venetia venetia chi non ti vede non ti pretia
who understandeth thee not loves thee not ut re sol la mi fa
under pardon sir what are the contents
or rather as horace says in his what my soul verses
let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine
reads if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vowed
though to myself forsworn to thee i ll faithful prove those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like osiers bowed
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
thy eye jove s lightning bears thy voice his dreadful thunder which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art o pardon love this wrong that singes heaven s praise with such an earthly tongue
you find not the apostrophas and so miss the accent let me supervise the canzonet
here are only numbers ratified but for the elegancy facility and golden cadence of poesy caret
and why indeed naso but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy the jerks of invention
imitari is nothing so doth the hound his master the ape his keeper the tired horse his rider
but damosella virgin was this directed to you
ay sir from one monsieur berowne one of the strange queen s lords
i will overglance the superscript to the snow white hand of the most beauteous lady rosaline
i will look again on the intellect of the letter for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto your ladyship s in all desired employment berowne
sir nathaniel this berowne is one of the votaries with the king and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen s which accidentally or by the way of progression hath miscarried
trip and go my sweet deliver this paper into the royal hand of the king it may concern much
stay not thy compliment i forgive thy duty
sir you have done this in the fear of god very religiously and as a certain father saith holofernes
sir tell not me of the father i do fear colourable colours
but to return to the verses did they please you sir nathaniel
i do dine to day at the father s of a certain pupil of mine where if before repast it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace i will on my privilege i have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil undertake your ben venuto where i will prove those verses to be very unlearned neither savouring of poetry wit nor invention
and thank you too for society saith the text is the happiness of life
and certes the text most infallibly concludes it
to dull sir i do invite you too you shall not say me nay pauca verba
away the gentles are at their game and we will to our recreation
the park enter berowne with a paper his band alone berowne
the king he is hunting the deer i am coursing myself
they have pitch d a toil i am tolling in a pitch pitch that defiles
for so they say the fool said and so say i and i am the fool
by the lord this love is as mad as ajax it kills sheep it kills me i a sheep
well proved again o my side
i will not love if i do hang me
by this light but for her eye i would not love her yes for her two eyes
well i do nothing in the world but lie and lie in my throat
by heaven i do love and it hath taught me to rhyme and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme and here my melancholy
well she hath one o my sonnets already the clown bore it the fool sent it and the lady hath it sweet clown sweeter fool sweetest lady
by the world i would not care a pin if the other three were in
here comes one with a paper god give him grace to groan
climbs into a tree enter the king with a paper king
proceed sweet cupid thou hast thump d him with thy bird bolt under the left pap
reads so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not to those fresh morning drops upon the rose as thy eye beams when their fresh rays have smote the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows nor shines the silver moon one half so bright through the transparent bosom of the deep as doth thy face through tears of mine give light
thou shin st in every tear that i do weep no drop but as a coach doth carry thee so ridest thou triumphing in my woe
do but behold the tears that swell in me and they thy glory through my grief will show
but do not love thyself then thou wilt keep my tears for glasses and still make me weep
how far dost thou excel no thought can think nor tongue of mortal tell
how shall she know my griefs
i ll drop the paper sweet leaves shade folly
steps aside enter longaville with a paper what longaville and reading
now in thy likeness one more fool appear
why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers
in love i hope sweet fellowship in shame
one drunkard loves another of the name
am i the first that have been perjur d so
i could put thee in comfort not by two that i know thou makest the triumviry the corner cap of society the shape of love s tyburn that hangs up simplicity
i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
o sweet maria empress of my love
these numbers will i tear and write in prose
o rhymes are guards on wanton cupid s hose disfigure not his slop
he reads the sonnet did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye gainst whom the world cannot hold argument persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove thou being a goddess i forswore not thee my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love thy grace being gain d cures all disgrace in me
vows are but breath and breath a vapour is then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine exhal st this vapour vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine if by me broke what fool is not so wise to lose an oath to win a paradise
this is the liver vein which makes flesh a deity a green goose a goddess pure pure idolatry
we are much out o th way
enter dumain with a paper longaville
by whom shall i send this company
all hid all hid an old infant play
like a demigod here sit i in the sky and wretched fools secrets heedfully o er eye
o heavens i have my wish
by heaven the wonder in a mortal eye
by earth she is not corporal there you lie
her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted
an amber colour d raven was well noted
stoop i say her shoulder is with child
ay as some days but then no sun must shine
o that i had my wish
and i mine too good lord
is not that a good word
i would forget her but a fever she reigns in my blood and will rememb red be
why then incision would let her out in saucers
once more i ll read the ode that i have writ
once more i ll mark how love can vary wit
reads on a day alack the day love whose month is ever may spied a blossom passing fair playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind all unseen can passage find that the lover sick to death wish d himself the heaven s breath
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow air would i might triumph so
but alack my hand is sworn ne er to pluck thee from thy thorn vow alack for youth unmeet youth so apt to pluck a sweet
do not call it sin in me that i am forsworn for thee thou for whom jove would swear juno but an ethiope were and deny himself for jove turning mortal for thy love
this will i send and something else more plain that shall express my true love s fasting pain
o would the king berowne and longaville were lovers too
ill to example ill would from my forehead wipe a perjur d note for none offend where all alike do dote
advancing dumain thy love is far from charity that in love s grief desir st society you may look pale but i should blush i know to be o erheard and taken napping so
advancing come sir you blush as his your case is such
you chide at him offending twice as much you do not love maria
longaville did never sonnet for her sake compile nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart his loving bosom to keep down his heart
i have been closely shrouded in this bush and mark d you both and for you both did blush
i heard your guilty rhymes observ d your fashion saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
one her hairs were gold crystal the other s eyes
to longaville you would for paradise break faith and troth to dumain and jove for your love would infringe an oath
what will berowne say when that he shall hear faith infringed which such zeal did swear
how will he scorn how will he spend his wit
how will he triumph leap and laugh at it
for all the wealth that ever i did see i would not have him know so much by me
descending now step i forth to whip hypocrisy ah good my liege i pray thee pardon me
good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove these worms for loving that art most in love
your eyes do make no coaches in your tears there is no certain princess that appears you ll not be perjur d tis a hateful thing tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
nay are you not all three of you to be thus much o ershot
you found his mote the king your mote did see but i a beam do find in each of three
o what a scene of fool ry have i seen of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
o me with what strict patience have i sat to see a king transformed to a gnat
to see great hercules whipping a gig and profound solomon to tune a jig and nestor play at push pin with the boys and critic timon laugh at idle toys
where lies thy grief o tell me good dumain
and gentle longaville where lies thy pain
are we betrayed thus to thy over view
not you by me but i betrayed to you
i that am honest i that hold it sin to break the vow i am engaged in i am betrayed by keeping company with men like you men of inconstancy
when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
or spend a minute s time in pruning me
when shall you hear that i will praise a hand a foot a face an eye a gait a state a brow a breast a waist a leg a limb king
a true man or a thief that gallops so
i post from love good lover let me go
if it mar nothing neither the treason and you go in peace away together
i beseech your grace let this letter be read our person misdoubts it twas treason he said
berowne reads the letter where hadst thou it
a toy my liege a toy
your grace needs not fear it
it did move him to passion and therefore let s hear it
it is berowne s writing and here is his name
to costard ah you whoreson loggerhead you were born to do me shame
that you three fools lack d me fool to make up the mess he he and you and you my liege and i are pick purses in love and we deserve to die
o dismiss this audience and i shall tell you more
walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
sweet lords sweet lovers o let us embrace
as true we are as flesh and blood can be
the sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face young blood doth not obey an old decree
we cannot cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn
what did these rent lines show some love of thine
who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first op ning of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast
what peremptory eagle sighted eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty
what zeal what fury hath inspir d thee now
my love her mistress is a gracious moon she an attending star scarce seen a light
my eyes are then no eyes nor i berowne
o but for my love day would turn to night
of all complexions the cull d sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues fie painted rhetoric
to things of sale a seller s praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot
a wither d hermit five score winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye
beauty doth varnish age as if new born and gives the crutch the cradle s infancy
o tis the sun that maketh all things shine
by heaven thy love is black as ebony
a wife of such wood were felicity
o who can give an oath
that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look
no face is fair that is not full so black
black is the badge of hell the hue of dungeons and the school of night and beauty s crest becomes the heavens well
devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
o if in black my lady s brows be deckt it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair
her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow
to look like her are chimney sweepers black
and since her time are colliers counted bright
and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
dark needs no candles now for dark is light
your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be wash d away
twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain i ll find a fairer face not wash d to day
i ll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here
no devil will fright thee then so much as she
i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
look here s thy love my foot and her face see
o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread
then as she goes what upward lies the street should see as she walk d overhead
are we not all in love
nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
then leave this chat and good berowne now prove our loving lawful and our faith not torn
ay marry there some flattery for this evil
o some authority how to proceed some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
have at you then affection s men at arms
consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason gainst the kingly state of youth
your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies
and where that you you have vow d to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look
for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study s excellence without the beauty of a woman s face
from women s eyes this doctrine i derive they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and long during action tires the sinewy vigour of the traveller
now for not looking on a woman s face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman s eye
learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes with ourselves
do we not likewise see our learning there
o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books
for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty s tutors have enrich d you with
other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady s eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices
it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover s eyes will gaze an eagle blind
a lover s ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopp d
love s feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails love s tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste
for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides
subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo s lute strung with his hair
and when love speaks the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony
never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temp red with love s sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility
from women s eyes this doctrine i derive
they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in aught proves excellent
then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
for wisdom s sake a word that all men love or for love s sake a word that loves all men or for men s sake the authors of these women or women s sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfils the law and who can sever love from charity
advance your standards and upon them lords pell mell down with them
be first advis d in conflict that you get the sun of them
now to plain dealing lay these glozes by
shall we resolve to woo these girls of france
and win them too therefore let us devise some entertainment for them in their tents
first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress
in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can shape for revels dances masks and merry hours forerun fair love strewing her way with flowers
no time shall be omitted that will betime and may by us be fitted
sow d cockle reap d no corn and justice always whirls in equal measure
light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn if so our copper buys no better treasure
the park enter holofernes sir nathaniel and dull holofernes
i praise god for you sir
your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty without affection audacious without impudency learned without opinion and strange without heresy
i did converse this quondam day with a companion of the king s who is intituled nominated or called don adriano de armado
his humour is lofty his discourse peremptory his tongue filed his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general behaviour vain ridiculous and thrasonical
he is too picked too spruce too affected too odd as it were too peregrinate as i may call it
a most singular and choice epithet
draws out his table book holofernes
he draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument
i abhor such fanatical phantasimes such insociable and point devise companions such rackers of orthography as to speak dout fine when he should say doubt det when he should pronounce debt d e b t not d e t he clepeth a calf cauf half hauf neighbour vocatur nebour neigh abbreviated ne
this is abhominable which he would call abbominable
it insinuateth me of insanie ne intelligis domine
priscian a little scratch d twill serve
enter armado moth and costard nathaniel
men of peace well encount red
aside to costard they have been at a great feast of languages and stol n the scraps
o they have liv d long on the alms basket of words
i marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word for thou are not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus thou art easier swallowed than a flap dragon
to holofernes monsieur are you not lett red
yes yes he teaches boys the hornbook
what is a b spelt backward with the horn on his head
ba pueritia with a horn added
ba most silly sheep with a horn
the third of the five vowels if you repeat them or the fifth if i holofernes
i will repeat them a e i moth

offer d by a child to an old man which is wit old
thou disputes like an infant go whip thy gig
lend me your horn to make one and i will whip about your infamy circum circa a gig of a cuckold s horn
an i had but one penny in the world thou shouldst have it to buy ginger bread
hold there is the very remuneration i had of thy master thou halfpenny purse of wit thou pigeon egg of discretion
o an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard what a joyful father wouldst thou make me
go to thou hast it ad dunghill at the fingers ends as they say
o i smell false latin dunghill for unguem

do you not educate youth at the charge house on the top of the mountain
at your sweet pleasure for the mountain
sir it is the king s most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the princess at her pavilion in the posteriors of this day which the rude multitude call the afternoon
the posterior of the day most generous sir is liable congruent and measurable for the afternoon
the word is well cull d chose sweet and apt i do assure you sir i do assure
sir the king is a noble gentleman and my familiar i do assure ye very good friend
for what is inward between us let it pass
i do beseech thee remember thy courtesy
i beseech thee apparel thy head
and among other importunate and most serious designs and of great import indeed too but let that pass for i must tell thee it will please his grace by the world sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder and with his royal finger thus dally with my excrement with my mustachio but sweet heart let that pass
by the world i recount no fable some certain special honours it pleaseth his greatness to impart to armado a soldier a man of travel that hath seen the world but let that pass
the very all of all is but sweet heart i do implore secrecy that the king would have me present the princess sweet chuck with some delightful ostentation or show or pageant or antic or firework
now understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth as it were i have acquainted you withal to the end to crave your assistance
sir you shall present before her the nine worthies
sir nathaniel as concerning some entertainment of time some show in the posterior of this day to be rend red by our assistance the king s command and this most gallant illustrate and learned gentleman before the princess i say none so fit as to present the nine worthies
where will you find men worthy enough to present them
joshua yourself myself alexander this gallant gentleman judas maccabaeus this swain because of his great limb or joint shall pass pompey the great the page hercules
pardon sir error he is not quantity enough for that worthy s thumb he is not so big as the end of his club
he shall present hercules in minority his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake and i will have an apology for that purpose
so if any of the audience hiss you may cry well done hercules now thou crushest the snake
that is the way to make an offence gracious though few have the grace to do it
for the rest of the worthies
shall i tell you a thing
we will have if this fadge not an antic
thou has spoken no word all this while
i ll make one in a dance or so or i will play on the tabor to the worthies and let them dance the hay
the park enter the princess maria katharine and rosaline princess of france
sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart if fairings come thus plentifully in
a lady wall d about with diamonds
look you what i have from the loving king
madam came nothing else along with that
yes as much love in rhyme as would be cramm d up in a sheet of paper writ o both sides the leaf margent and all that he was fain to seal on cupid s name
that was the way to make his godhead wax for he hath been five thousand year a boy
ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
you ll ne er be friends with him a kill d your sister
he made her melancholy sad and heavy and so she died
had she been light like you of such a merry nimble stirring spirit she might a been a grandam ere she died
and so may you for a light heart lives long
what s your dark meaning mouse of this light word
a light condition in a beauty dark
we need more light to find your meaning out
you ll mar the light by taking it in snuff therefore i ll darkly end the argument
look what you do you do it still i th dark
so do not you for you are a light wench
indeed i weigh not you and therefore light
o that s you care not for me
great reason for past cure is still past care
well bandied both a set of wit well play d
but rosaline you have a favour too
an if my face were but as fair as yours my favour were as great be witness this
nay i have verses too i thank berowne the numbers true and were the numb ring too i were the fairest goddess on the ground
i am compar d to twenty thousand fairs
o he hath drawn my picture in his letter
much in the letters nothing in the praise
beauteous as ink a good conclusion
fair as a text b in a copy book
let me not die your debtor my red dominical my golden letter o that your face were not so full of o s
but katharine what was sent to you from fair dumain
did he not send you twain
yes madam and moreover some thousand verses of a faithful lover a huge translation of hypocrisy vilely compil d profound simplicity
this and these pearl to me sent longaville the letter is too long by half a mile
dost thou not wish in heart the chain were longer and the letter short
ay or i would these hands might never part
we are wise girls to mock our lovers so
they are worse fools to purchase mocking so
that same berowne i ll torture ere i go
o that i knew he were but in by th week
how i would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the season and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests and make him proud to make me proud that jests
so pertaunt like would i o ersway his state that he should be my fool and i his fate
none are so surely caught when they are catch d as wit turn d fool folly in wisdom hatch d hath wisdom s warrant and the help of school and wit s own grace to grace a learned fool
the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity s revolt to wantonness
folly in fools bears not so strong a note as fool ry in the wise when wit doth dote since all the power thereof it doth apply to prove by wit worth in simplicity
here comes boyet and mirth is in his face
o i am stabb d with laughter
encounters mounted are against your peace
love doth approach disguis d armed in arguments you ll be surpris d
muster your wits stand in your own defence or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
what are they that charge their breath against us
under the cool shade of a sycamore i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour when lo to interrupt my purpos d rest toward that shade i might behold addrest the king and his companions warily i stole into a neighbour thicket by and overheard what you shall overhear that by and by disguis d they will be here
their herald is a pretty knavish page that well by heart hath conn d his embassage
action and accent did they teach him there thus must thou speak and thus thy body bear and ever and anon they made a doubt presence majestical would put him out for quoth the king an angel shalt thou see yet fear not thou but speak audaciously
the boy replied an angel is not evil i should have fear d her had she been a devil
with that all laugh d and clapp d him on the shoulder making the bold wag by their praises bolder
one rubb d his elbow thus and fleer d and swore a better speech was never spoke before
another with his finger and his thumb cried via
we will do t come what will come
the third he caper d and cried all goes well
the fourth turn d on the toe and down he fell
with that they all did tumble on the ground with such a zealous laughter so profound that in this spleen ridiculous appears to check their folly passion s solemn tears
but what but what come they to visit us
they do they do and are apparell d thus like muscovites or russians as i guess
their purpose is to parley court and dance and every one his love feat will advance unto his several mistress which they ll know by favours several which they did bestow
the gallants shall be task d for ladies we will every one be mask d and not a man of them shall have the grace despite of suit to see a lady s face
hold rosaline this favour thou shalt wear and then the king will court thee for his dear hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine so shall berowne take me for rosaline
and change you favours too so shall your loves woo contrary deceiv d by these removes
come on then wear the favours most in sight
but in this changing what is your intent
the effect of my intent is to cross theirs
they do it but in mocking merriment and mock for mock is only my intent
their several counsels they unbosom shall to loves mistook and so be mock d withal upon the next occasion that we meet with visages display d to talk and greet
but shall we dance if they desire us to t
no to the death we will not move a foot nor to their penn d speech render we no grace but while tis spoke each turn away her face
why that contempt will kill the speaker s heart and quite divorce his memory from his part
therefore i do it and i make no doubt the rest will ne er come in if he be out
there s no such sport as sport by sport o erthrown to make theirs ours and ours none but our own so shall we stay mocking intended game and they well mock d depart away with shame
the trumpet sounds be mask d the maskers come
the ladies mask enter blackamoors music moth as prologue the king and his lords as maskers in the guise of russians moth
all hail the richest heauties on the earth
beauties no richer than rich taffeta
a holy parcel of the fairest dames the ladies turn their backs to him that ever turn d their backs to mortal views
that ever turn d their eyes to mortal views
out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe not to behold berowne
once to behold with your sun beamed eyes with your sun beamed eyes boyet
they will not answer to that epithet you were best call it daughter beamed eyes
they do not mark me and that brings me out
if they do speak our language tis our will that some plain man recount their purposes
what would you with the princess
nothing but peace and gentle visitation
nothing but peace and gentle visitation
why that they have and bid them so be gone
she says you have it and you may be gone
say to her we have measur d many miles to tread a measure with her on this grass
they say that they have measur d many a mile to tread a measure with you on this grass
ask them how many inches is in one mile
if they have measured many the measure then of one is eas ly told
if to come hither you have measur d miles and many miles the princess bids you tell how many inches doth fill up one mile
tell her we measure them by weary steps
how many weary steps of many weary miles you have o ergone are numb red in the travel of one mile
we number nothing that we spend for you our duty is so rich so infinite that we may do it still without accompt
vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face that we like savages may worship it
my face is but a moon and clouded too
blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine those clouds removed upon our watery eyne
beg a greater matter thou now requests but moonshine in the water
then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
thou bid st me beg this begging is not strange
nay you must do it soon
thus change i like the moon
you took the moon at full but now she s changed
yet still she is the moon and i the man
the music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
but your legs should do it
since you are strangers and come here by chance we ll not be nice take hands
curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
more measure of this measure be not nice
we can afford no more at such a price
then cannot we be bought and so adieu twice to your visor and half once to you
if you deny to dance let s hold more chat
i am best pleas d with that
white handed mistress one sweet word with thee
honey and milk and sugar there is three
nay then two treys an if you grow so nice metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
there s half a dozen sweets
since you can cog i ll play no more with you
will you vouchsafe with me to change a word
fair lord take that for your fair lady
please it you as much in private and i ll bid adieu
what was your vizard made without a tongue
i know the reason lady why you ask
you have a double tongue within your mask and would afford my speechless vizard half
no i ll not be your half
take all and wean it it may prove an ox
look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
will you give horns chaste lady
then die a calf before your horns do grow
one word in private with you ere i die
bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen as is the razor s edge invisible cutting a smaller hair than may be seen above the sense of sense so sensible seemeth their conference their conceits have wings fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
not one word more my maids break off break off
by heaven all dry beaten with pure scoff
farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
exeunt king lords and blackamoors princess of france
are these the breed of wits so wondered at
tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff d out
well liking wits they have gross gross fat fat
o poverty in wit kingly poor flout
will they not think you hang themselves to night
or ever but in vizards show their faces
this pert berowne was out of count nance quite
they were all in lamentable cases
the king was weeping ripe for a good word
berowne did swear himself out of all suit
dumain was at my service and his sword
no point quoth i my servant straight was mute
lord longaville said i came o er his heart and trow you what he call d me
well better wits have worn plain statute caps
the king is my love sworn
and quick berowne hath plighted faith to me
and longaville was for my service born
dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
madam and pretty mistresses give ear immediately they will again be here in their own shapes for it can never be they will digest this harsh indignity
they will they will god knows and leap for joy though they are lame with blows therefore change favours and when they repair blow like sweet roses in this summer air
fair ladies mask d are roses in their bud dismask d their damask sweet commixture shown are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
what shall we do if they return in their own shapes to woo
good madam if by me you ll be advis d let s mock them still as well known as disguis d
let us complain to them what fools were here disguis d like muscovites in shapeless gear and wonder what they were and to what end their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn d and their rough carriage so ridiculous should be presented at our tent to us
ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
whip to our tents as roes run o er land
exeunt princess rosaline katharine and maria re enter the king berowne longaville and dumain in their proper habits king
please it your majesty command me any service to her thither
that she vouchsafe me audience for one word
i will and so will she i know my lord
this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease and utters it again when god doth please
he is wit s pedlar and retails his wares at wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs and we that sell by gross the lord doth know have not the grace to grace it with such show
this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve had he been adam he had tempted eve
a can carve too and lisp why this is he that kiss d his hand away in courtesy this is the ape of form monsieur the nice that when he plays at tables chides the dice in honourable terms nay he can sing a mean most meanly and in ushering mend him who can
the ladies call him sweet the stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
this is the flow r that smiles on every one to show his teeth as white as whales bone and consciences that will not die in debt pay him the due of honey tongued boyet
a blister on his sweet tongue with my heart that put armado s page out of his part
re enter the princess ushered by boyet rosaline maria and katharine berowne
behaviour what wert thou till this man show d thee
all hail sweet madam and fair time of day
fair in all hail is foul as i conceive
construe my speeches better if you may
then wish me better i will give you leave
we came to visit you and purpose now to lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
this field shall hold me and so hold your vow nor god nor i delights in perjur d men
rebuke me not for that which you provoke
the virtue of your eye must break my oath
you nickname virtue vice you should have spoke for virtue s office never breaks men s troth
now by my maiden honour yet as pure as the unsullied lily i protest a world of torments though i should endure i would not yield to be your house s guest so much i hate a breaking cause to be of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity
o you have liv d in desolation here unseen unvisited much to our shame
not so my lord it is not so i swear we have had pastimes here and pleasant game a mess of russians left us but of late
ay in truth my lord trim gallants full of courtship and of state
it is not so my lord
my lady to the manner of the days in courtesy gives undeserving praise
we four indeed confronted were with four in russian habit here they stayed an hour and talk d apace and in that hour my lord they did not bless us with one happy word
i dare not call them fools but this i think when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
this jest is dry to me
fair gentle sweet your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet with eyes best seeing heaven s fiery eye by light we lose light your capacity is of that nature that to your huge store wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
this proves you wise and rich for in my eye berowne
i am a fool and full of poverty
but that you take what doth to you belong it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
o i am yours and all that i possess
which of the vizards was it that you wore
there then that vizard that superfluous case that hid the worse and show d the better face
we were descried they ll mock us now downright
let us confess and turn it to a jest
sea sick i think coming from muscovy
thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
can any face of brass hold longer out
here stand i lady dart thy skill at me bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit and i will wish thee never more to dance nor never more in russian habit wait
o never will i trust to speeches penn d nor to the motion of a school boy s tongue nor never come in vizard to my friend nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper s song
taffeta phrases silken terms precise three pil d hyperboles spruce affectation figures pedantical these summer flies have blown me full of maggot ostentation
i do forswear them and i here protest by this white glove how white the hand god knows henceforth my wooing mind shall be express d in russet yeas and honest kersey noes
and to begin wench so god help me law my love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw
yet i have a trick of the old rage bear with me i am sick i ll leave it by degrees
soft let us see write lord have mercy on us on those three they are infected in their hearts it lies they have the plague and caught it of your eyes
these lords are visited you are not free for the lord s tokens on you do i see
no they are free that gave these tokens to us
our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
it is not so for how can this be true that you stand forfeit being those that sue
peace for i will not have to do with you
nor shall not if i do as i intend
speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression some fair excuse
were not you here but even now disguis d
and were you well advis d
when you then were here what did you whisper in your lady s ear
that more than all the world i did respect her
when she shall challenge this you will reject her
peace peace forbear your oath once broke you force not to forswear
despise me when i break this oath of mine
i will and therefore keep it
rosaline what did the russian whisper in your ear
madam he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight and did value me above this world adding thereto moreover that he would wed me or else die my lover
god give thee joy of him
the noble lord most honourably doth uphold his word
by my life my troth i never swore this lady such an oath
by heaven you did and to confirm it plain you gave me this but take it sir again
my faith and this the princess i did give i knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
pardon me sir this jewel did she wear and lord berowne i thank him is my dear
what will you have me or your pearl again
neither of either i remit both twain
i see the trick on t here was a consent knowing aforehand of our merriment to dash it like a christmas comedy
some carry tale some please man some slight zany some mumble news some trencher knight some dick that smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick to make my lady laugh when she s dispos d told our intents before which once disclos d the ladies did change favours and then we following the signs woo d but the sign of she
now to our perjury to add more terror we are again forsworn in will and error
much upon this it is to boyet and might not you forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
do not you know my lady s foot by th squier and laugh upon the apple of her eye
and stand between her back sir and the fire holding a trencher jesting merrily
go you are allow d die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
you leer upon me do you
there s an eye wounds like a leaden sword
full merrily hath this brave manage this career been run
thou part st a fair fray
o lord sir they would know whether the three worthies shall come in or no
no sir but it is vara fine for every one pursents three
and three times thrice is nine
not so sir under correction sir i hope it is not so
you cannot beg us sir i can assure you sir we know what we know i hope sir three times thrice sir berowne
under correction sir we know whereuntil it doth amount
by jove i always took three threes for nine
o lord sir it were pity you should get your living by reck ning sir
o lord sir the parties themselves the actors sir will show whereuntil it doth amount
for mine own part i am as they say but to parfect one man in one poor man pompion the great sir
art thou one of the worthies
it pleased them to think me worthy of pompey the great for mine own part i know not the degree of the worthy but i am to stand for him
we will turn it finely off sir we will take some care
berowne they will shame us let them not approach
we are shame proof my lord and tis some policy to have one show worse than the king s and his company
i say they shall not come
nay my good lord let me o errule you now
that sport best pleases that doth least know how where zeal strives to content and the contents dies in the zeal of that which it presents
their form confounded makes most form in mirth when great things labouring perish in their birth
a right description of our sport my lord
anointed i implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace of words
converses apart with the king and delivers a paper princess of france
a speaks not like a man of god his making
that is all one my fair sweet honey monarch for i protest the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical too too vain too too vain but we will put it as they say to fortuna de la guerra
i wish you the peace of mind most royal couplement
here is like to be a good presence of worthies
he presents hector of troy the swain pompey the great the parish curate alexander arinado s page hercules the pedant judas maccabaeus
and if these four worthies in their first show thrive these four will change habits and present the other five
there is five in the first show
you are deceived tis not so
the pedant the braggart the hedge priest the fool and the boy abate throw at novum and the whole world again cannot pick out five such take each one in his vein
the ship is under sail and here she comes amain
enter costard armed for pompey costard
you lie you are not he
with libbard s head on knee
well said old mocker i must needs be friends with thee
i pompey am pompey surnam d the big dumain
pompey surnam d the great that oft in field with targe and shield did make my foe to sweat and travelling along this coast i bere am come by chance and lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of france
if your ladyship would say thanks pompey i had done
tis not so much worth but i hope i was perfect
i made a little fault in great
my hat to a halfpenny pompey proves the best worthy
enter sir nathaniel for alexander nathaniel
when in the world i liv d i was the world s commander by east west north and south i spread my conquering might
my scutcheon plain declares that i am alisander boyet
your nose says no you are not for it stands to right
your nose smells no in this most tender smelling knight
when in the world i liv d i was the world s commander boyet
most true tis right you were so alisander
take away the conqueror take away alisander
to sir nathaniel o sir you have overthrown alisander the conqueror
you will be scrap d out of the painted cloth for this
your lion that holds his poleaxe sitting on a close stool will be given to ajax
he will be the ninth worthy
a conqueror and afeard to speak
sir nathaniel retires there an t shall please you a foolish mild man an honest man look you and soon dash d
he is a marvellous good neighbour faith and a very good bowler but for alisander alas
you see how tis a little o erparted
but there are worthies a coming will speak their mind in some other sort
enter holofernes for judas and moth for hercules holofernes
great hercules is presented by this imp whose club kill d cerberus that three headed canus and when be was a babe a child a shrimp thus did he strangle serpents in his manus
quoniam he seemeth in minority ergo i come with this apology
keep some state in thy exit and vanish
moth retires judas i am dumain
judas maccabaeus clipt is plain judas
how art thou prov d judas
the more shame for you judas
begin sir you are my elder
well followed judas was hanged on an elder
i will not be put out of countenance
a death s face in a ring
the face of an old roman coin scarce seen
the pommel of coesar s falchion
the carv d bone face on a flask
saint george s half cheek in a brooch
ay and in a brooch of lead
ay and worn in the cap of a tooth drawer
and now forward for we have put thee in countenance
you have put me out of countenance
false we have given thee faces
but you have outfac d them all
an thou wert a lion we would do so
therefore as he is an ass let him go
for the latter end of his name
for the ass to the jude give it him jud as away
this is not generous not gentle not humble
it grows dark he may stumble
alas poor maccabaeus how hath he been baited
hide thy head achilles here comes hector in arms
though my mocks come home by me i will now be merry
hector was but a troyan in respect of this
i think hector was not so clean timber d
his leg is too big for hector s
no he is best indued in the small
he s a god or a painter for he makes faces
the armipotent mars of lances the almighty gave hector a gift dumain
the armipotent mars of lances the almighty gave hector a gift the heir of ilion a man so breathed that certain he would fight ye from morn till night out of his pavilion
sweet lord longaville rein thy tongue
i must rather give it the rein for it runs against hector
ay and hector s a greyhound
the sweet war man is dead and rotten sweet chucks beat not the bones of the buried when he breathed he was a man
but i will forward with my device
to the princess sweet royalty bestow on me the sense of hearing
berowne steps forth and speaks to costard princess of france
speak brave hector we are much delighted
i do adore thy sweet grace s slipper
aside to dumain loves her by the foot
aside to boyet he may not by the yard
this hector far surmounted hannibal costard
the party is gone fellow hector she is gone she is two months on her way
faith unless you play the honest troyan the poor wench is cast away
she s quick the child brags in her belly already tis yours
dost thou infamonize me among potentates
then shall hector be whipt for jaquenetta that is quick by him and hang d for pompey that is dead by him
ay if a have no more man s blood in his belly than will sup a flea
by the north pole i do challenge thee
i will not fight with a pole like a northern man i ll slash i ll do it by the sword
i bepray you let me borrow my arms again
i ll do it in my shirt
master let me take you a buttonhole lower
do you not see pompey is uncasing for the combat
gentlemen and soldiers pardon me i will not combat in my shirt
you may not deny it pompey hath made the challenge
sweet bloods i both may and will
what reason have you for t
the naked truth of it is i have no shirt i go woolward for penance
true and it was enjoined him in rome for want of linen since when i ll be sworn he wore none but a dishclout of jaquenetta s and that a wears next his heart for a favour
enter as messenger monsieur marcade marcade
welcome marcade but that thou interruptest our merriment
i am sorry madam for the news i bring is heavy in my tongue
the king your father princess of france
even so my tale is told
worthies away the scene begins to cloud
for mine own part i breathe free breath
i have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and i will right myself like a soldier
boyet prepare i will away to night
madam not so i do beseech you stay
i thank you gracious lords for all your fair endeavours and entreat out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide the liberal opposition of our spirits if over boldly we have borne ourselves in the converse of breath your gentleness was guilty of it
a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
excuse me so coming too short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtain d
the extreme parts of time extremely forms all causes to the purpose of his speed and often at his very loose decides that which long process could not arbitrate
and though the mourning brow of progeny forbid the smiling courtesy of love the holy suit which fain it would convince yet since love s argument was first on foot let not the cloud of sorrow justle it from what it purpos d since to wail friends lost is not by much so wholesome profitable as to rejoice at friends but newly found
i understand you not my griefs are double
honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief and by these badges understand the king
therefore ladies our love being yours the error that love makes is likewise yours
we to ourselves prove false by being once false for ever to be true to those that make us both fair ladies you and even that falsehood in itself a sin thus purifies itself and turns to grace
we have receiv d your letters full of love your favours the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment
our letters madam show d much more than jest
we did not quote them so
now at the latest minute of the hour grant us your loves
a time methinks too short to make a world without end bargain in
no no my lord your grace is perjur d much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause you will do aught this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage remote from all the pleasures of the world there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning
if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mournful house raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father s death
if this thou do deny let our hands part neither intitled in the other s heart
if this or more than this i would deny to flatter up these powers of mine with rest the sudden hand of death close up mine eye
hence hermit then my heart is in thy breast
and what to me my love
you must he purged too your sins are rack d you are attaint with faults and perjury therefore if you my favour mean to get a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest but seek the weary beds of people sick
but what to me my love
a beard fair health and honesty with threefold love i wish you all these three
o shall i say i thank you gentle wife
no so my lord a twelvemonth and a day i ll mark no words that smooth fac d wooers say
come when the king doth to my lady come then if i have much love i ll give you some
i ll serve thee true and faithfully till then
yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again
at the twelvemonth s end i ll change my black gown for a faithful friend
i ll stay with patience but the time is long
the liker you few taller are so young
mistress look on me behold the window of my heart mine eye what humble suit attends thy answer there
impose some service on me for thy love
oft have i heard of you my lord berowne before i saw you and the world s large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you on all estates will execute that lie within the mercy of your wit
to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain and therewithal to win me if you please without the which i am not to be won you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches and your task shall be with all the fierce endeavour of your wit to enforce the pained impotent to smile
to move wild laughter in the throat of death
it cannot be it is impossible mirth cannot move a soul in agony
why that s the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
a jest s prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it then if sickly ears deaf d with the clamours of their own dear groans will hear your idle scorns continue then and i will have you and that fault withal
but if they will not throw away that spirit and i shall find you empty of that fault right joyful of your reformation
well befall what will befall i ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital
to the king ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave
no madam we will bring you on your way
our wooing doth not end like an old play jack hath not jill
these ladies courtesy might well have made our sport a comedy
come sir it wants a twelvemonth an a day and then twill end
that s too long for a play
sweet majesty vouchsafe me princess of france
i will kiss thy royal finger and take leave
i am a votary i have vow d to jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year
but most esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo
it should have followed in the end of our show
call them forth quickly we will do so
enter all this side is hiems winter this ver the spring the one maintained by the owl th other by the cuckoo
spring when daisies pied and violets blue and lady smocks all silver white and cuckoo buds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight the cuckoo then on every tree mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear unpleasing to a married ear
when shepherds pipe on oaten straws and merry larks are ploughmen s clocks when turtles tread and rooks and daws and maidens bleach their summer smocks the cuckoo then on every tree mocks married men for thus sings he cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo o word of fear unpleasing to a married ear
winter when icicles hang by the wall and dick the shepherd blows his nail and tom bears logs into the hall and milk comes frozen home in pail when blood is nipp d and ways be foul then nightly sings the staring owl tu who tu whit tu who a merry note while greasy joan doth keel the pot
when all aloud the wind doth blow and coughing drowns the parson s saw and birds sit brooding in the snow and marian s nose looks red and raw when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl then nightly sings the staring owl tu who tu whit to who a merry note while greasy joan doth keel the pot

enter king duncan malcolm donalbain lennox with attendants meeting a bleeding captain
he can report as seemeth by his plight of the revolt the newest state
this is the sergeant who like a good and hardy soldier fought ’gainst my captivity —hail brave friend
say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it
doubtful it stood as two spent swimmers that do cling together and choke their art
the merciless macdonwald worthy to be a rebel for to that the multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him from the western isles of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling show’d like a rebel’s whore
but all’s too weak for brave macbeth well he deserves that name disdaining fortune with his brandish’d steel which smok’d with bloody execution like valour’s minion carv’d out his passage till he fac’d the slave which ne’er shook hands nor bade farewell to him till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops and fix’d his head upon our battlements
as whence the sun ’gins his reflection shipwracking storms and direful thunders break so from that spring whence comfort seem’d to come discomfort swells
mark king of scotland mark no sooner justice had with valour arm’d compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels but the norweyan lord surveying vantage with furbish’d arms and new supplies of men began a fresh assault
dismay’d not this our captains macbeth and banquo
yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
if i say sooth i must report they were as cannons overcharg’d with double cracks so they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds or memorize another golgotha i cannot tell— but i am faint my gashes cry for help
so well thy words become thee as thy wounds they smack of honour both —go get him surgeons

what a haste looks through his eyes
so should he look that seems to speak things strange
from fife great king where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold
norway himself with terrible numbers assisted by that most disloyal traitor the thane of cawdor began a dismal conflict till that bellona’s bridegroom lapp’d in proof confronted him with self comparisons point against point rebellious arm ’gainst arm curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude the victory fell on us
that now sweno the norways’ king craves composition nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed at saint colme’s inch ten thousand dollars to our general use
no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive our bosom interest
go pronounce his present death and with his former title greet macbeth
what he hath lost noble macbeth hath won
a sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and mounch’d and mounch’d and mounch’d
“aroint thee witch ” the rump fed ronyon cries
her husband’s to aleppo gone master o’ th’ tiger but in a sieve i’ll thither sail and like a rat without a tail i’ll do i’ll do and i’ll do
i myself have all the other and the very ports they blow all the quarters that they know i’ the shipman’s card
i will drain him dry as hay sleep shall neither night nor day hang upon his pent house lid he shall live a man forbid
weary sev’n nights nine times nine shall he dwindle peak and pine though his bark cannot be lost yet it shall be tempest tost
here i have a pilot’s thumb wrack’d as homeward he did come
the weird sisters hand in hand posters of the sea and land thus do go about about thrice to thine and thrice to mine and thrice again to make up nine
so foul and fair a day i have not seen
how far is’t call’d to forres —what are these so wither’d and so wild in their attire that look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth and yet are on’t —live you
or are you aught that man may question
you seem to understand me by each at once her choppy finger laying upon her skinny lips
you should be women and yet your beards forbid me to interpret that you are so
speak if you can —what are you
hail to thee thane of glamis
hail to thee thane of cawdor
good sir why do you start and seem to fear things that do sound so fair —i’ th’ name of truth are ye fantastical or that indeed which outwardly ye show
my noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope that he seems rapt withal
if you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate
not so happy yet much happier
thou shalt get kings though thou be none so all hail macbeth and banquo
stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
by sinel’s death i know i am thane of glamis but how of cawdor
the thane of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief no more than to be cawdor
say from whence you owe this strange intelligence
or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting —speak i charge you
the earth hath bubbles as the water has and these are of them
into the air and what seem’d corporal melted as breath into the wind
were such things here as we do speak about
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner
and thane of cawdor too went it not so
to the selfsame tune and words
the king hath happily receiv’d macbeth the news of thy success and when he reads thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight his wonders and his praises do contend which should be thine or his silenc’d with that in viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks nothing afeard of what thyself didst make strange images of death
as thick as tale came post with post and everyone did bear thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence and pour’d them down before him
we are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks only to herald thee into his sight not pay thee
and for an earnest of a greater honour he bade me from him call thee thane of cawdor in which addition hail most worthy thane for it is thine
what can the devil speak true
the thane of cawdor lives why do you dress me in borrow’d robes
who was the thane lives yet but under heavy judgement bears that life which he deserves to lose
whether he was combin’d with those of norway or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage or that with both he labour’d in his country’s wrack i know not but treasons capital confess’d and prov’d have overthrown him
aside glamis and thane of cawdor the greatest is behind
to ross and angus thanks for your pains
to banquo do you not hope your children shall be kings when those that gave the thane of cawdor to me promis’d no less to them
that trusted home might yet enkindle you unto the crown besides the thane of cawdor
but ’tis strange and oftentimes to win us to our harm the instruments of darkness tell us truths win us with honest trifles to betray’s in deepest consequence — cousins a word i pray you
aside two truths are told as happy prologues to the swelling act of the imperial theme —i thank you gentlemen — aside this supernatural soliciting cannot be ill cannot be good
if ill why hath it given me earnest of success commencing in a truth
i am thane of cawdor if good why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs against the use of nature
present fears are less than horrible imaginings
my thought whose murder yet is but fantastical shakes so my single state of man that function is smother’d in surmise and nothing is but what is not
aside if chance will have me king why chance may crown me without my stir
new honours come upon him like our strange garments cleave not to their mould but with the aid of use
aside come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day
worthy macbeth we stay upon your leisure
my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten
kind gentlemen your pains are register’d where every day i turn the leaf to read them —let us toward the king — think upon what hath chanc’d and at more time the interim having weigh’d it let us speak our free hearts each to other
enter duncan malcolm donalbain lennox and attendants
are not those in commission yet return’d
my liege they are not yet come back
but i have spoke with one that saw him die who did report that very frankly he confess’d his treasons implor’d your highness’ pardon and set forth a deep repentance
nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he ow’d as ’twere a careless trifle
there’s no art to find the mind’s construction in the face he was a gentleman on whom i built an absolute trust
enter macbeth banquo ross and angus
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me
thou art so far before that swiftest wing of recompense is slow to overtake thee
would thou hadst less deserv’d that the proportion both of thanks and payment might have been mine
only i have left to say more is thy due than more than all can pay
the service and the loyalty i owe in doing it pays itself
your highness’ part is to receive our duties and our duties are to your throne and state children and servants which do but what they should by doing everything safe toward your love and honour
welcome hither i have begun to plant thee and will labour to make thee full of growing —noble banquo that hast no less deserv’d nor must be known no less to have done so let me infold thee and hold thee to my heart
there if i grow the harvest is your own
my plenteous joys wanton in fulness seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow —sons kinsmen thanes and you whose places are the nearest know we will establish our estate upon our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter the prince of cumberland which honour must not unaccompanied invest him only but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine on all deservers —from hence to inverness and bind us further to you
the rest is labour which is not us’d for you i’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach so humbly take my leave
aside the prince of cumberland —that is a step on which i must fall down or else o’erleap for in my way it lies
let not light see my black and deep desires
the eye wink at the hand yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see
he is full so valiant and in his commendations i am fed
it is a banquet to me
let’s after him whose care is gone before to bid us welcome it is a peerless kinsman

“they met me in the day of success and i have learned by the perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge
when i burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished
whiles i stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king who all hailed me ‘thane of cawdor’ by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with ‘hail king that shalt be ’ this have i thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee
lay it to thy heart and farewell ” glamis thou art and cawdor and shalt be what thou art promis’d
yet do i fear thy nature it is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way
thou wouldst be great art not without ambition but without the illness should attend it
what thou wouldst highly that wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false and yet wouldst wrongly win
thou’dst have great glamis that which cries “thus thou must do ” if thou have it and that which rather thou dost fear to do than wishest should be undone
hie thee hither that i may pour my spirits in thine ear and chastise with the valour of my tongue all that impedes thee from the golden round which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem to have thee crown’d withal
is not thy master with him
who were’t so would have inform’d for preparation
so please you it is true

come you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here and fill me from the crown to the toe top full of direst cruelty
make thick my blood stop up th’ access and passage to remorse that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between th’ effect and it
come to my woman’s breasts and take my milk for gall your murd’ring ministers wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature’s mischief
come thick night and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell that my keen knife see not the wound it makes nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry “hold hold ” enter macbeth

to beguile the time look like the time bear welcome in your eye your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under’t

the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses
this guest of summer the temple haunting martlet does approve by his loved mansionry that the heaven’s breath smells wooingly here no jutty frieze buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle
where they most breed and haunt i have observ’d the air is delicate
see see our honour’d hostess — the love that follows us sometime is our trouble which still we thank as love
herein i teach you how you shall bid god ’ild us for your pains and thank us for your trouble
all our service in every point twice done and then done double were poor and single business to contend against those honours deep and broad wherewith your majesty loads our house for those of old and the late dignities heap’d up to them we rest your hermits
we cours’d him at the heels and had a purpose to be his purveyor but he rides well and his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him to his home before us
fair and noble hostess we are your guest tonight
your servants ever have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt to make their audit at your highness’ pleasure still to return your own
give me your hand conduct me to mine host we love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him
enter and pass over a sewer and divers servants with dishes and service
if it were done when ’tis done then ’twere well it were done quickly
if th’ assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success that but this blow might be the be all and the end all—here but here upon this bank and shoal of time we’d jump the life to come
but in these cases we still have judgement here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague th’ inventor
this even handed justice commends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice to our own lips
he’s here in double trust first as i am his kinsman and his subject strong both against the deed then as his host who should against his murderer shut the door not bear the knife myself
besides this duncan hath borne his faculties so meek hath been so clear in his great office that his virtues will plead like angels trumpet tongued against the deep damnation of his taking off and pity like a naked new born babe striding the blast or heaven’s cherubin hors’d upon the sightless couriers of the air shall blow the horrid deed in every eye that tears shall drown the wind —i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which o’erleaps itself and falls on th’ other— enter lady macbeth
why have you left the chamber
we will proceed no further in this business he hath honour’d me of late and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss not cast aside so soon
was the hope drunk wherein you dress’d yourself
and wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely
from this time such i account thy love
art thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour as thou art in desire
wouldst thou have that which thou esteem’st the ornament of life and live a coward in thine own esteem letting “i dare not” wait upon “i would ” like the poor cat i’ th’ adage
i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is none
what beast was’t then that made you break this enterprise to me
when you durst do it then you were a man and to be more than what you were you would be so much more the man
nor time nor place did then adhere and yet you would make both they have made themselves and that their fitness now does unmake you
i have given suck and know how tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me i would while it was smiling in my face have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums and dash’d the brains out had i so sworn as you have done to this
but screw your courage to the sticking place and we’ll not fail
when duncan is asleep whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey soundly invite him his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince that memory the warder of the brain shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbeck only when in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death what cannot you and i perform upon th’ unguarded duncan
what not put upon his spongy officers who shall bear the guilt of our great quell
bring forth men children only for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males
will it not be receiv’d when we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and us’d their very daggers that they have done’t
who dares receive it other as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar upon his death

this diamond he greets your wife withal by the name of most kind hostess and shut up in measureless content
being unprepar’d our will became the servant to defect which else should free have wrought
i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters to you they have show’d some truth
i think not of them yet when we can entreat an hour to serve we would spend it in some words upon that business if you would grant the time
if you shall cleave to my consent when ’tis it shall make honour for you
so i lose none in seeking to augment it but still keep my bosom franchis’d and allegiance clear i shall be counsell’d
thanks sir the like to you
go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready she strike upon the bell
exit servant is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand
come let me clutch thee — i have thee not and yet i see thee still
art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight
or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heat oppressed brain
i see thee yet in form as palpable as this which now i draw
thou marshall’st me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use
mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses or else worth all the rest i see thee still and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood which was not so before —there’s no such thing
it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes —now o’er the one half world nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtain’d sleep
witchcraft celebrates pale hecate’s off’rings and wither’d murder alarum’d by his sentinel the wolf whose howl’s his watch thus with his stealthy pace with tarquin’s ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost —thou sure and firm set earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and take the present horror from the time which now suits with it —whiles i threat he lives
words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
a bell rings i go and it is done
hear it not duncan for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell
that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold what hath quench’d them hath given me fire —hark —peace
it was the owl that shriek’d the fatal bellman which gives the stern’st good night
the doors are open and the surfeited grooms do mock their charge with snores i have drugg’d their possets that death and nature do contend about them whether they live or die
i am afraid they have awak’d and ’tis not done
th’ attempt and not the deed confounds us —hark —i laid their daggers ready he could not miss ’em —had he not resembled my father as he slept i had done’t —my husband
i have done the deed —didst thou not hear a noise
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
hark —who lies i’ th’ second chamber
looking on his hands lady macbeth
a foolish thought to say a sorry sight
there’s one did laugh in’s sleep and one cried “murder ” that they did wake each other i stood and heard them
but they did say their prayers and address’d them again to sleep
one cried “god bless us ” and “amen ” the other as they had seen me with these hangman’s hands
list’ning their fear i could not say “amen ” when they did say “god bless us ” lady macbeth
but wherefore could not i pronounce “amen”
i had most need of blessing and “amen” stuck in my throat
these deeds must not be thought after these ways so it will make us mad
methought i heard a voice cry “sleep no more
macbeth does murder sleep ”—the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care the death of each day’s life sore labour’s bath balm of hurt minds great nature’s second course chief nourisher in life’s feast
still it cried “sleep no more ” to all the house “glamis hath murder’d sleep and therefore cawdor shall sleep no more
macbeth shall sleep no more ” lady macbeth
who was it that thus cried
why worthy thane you do unbend your noble strength to think so brainsickly of things
go get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand — why did you bring these daggers from the place
they must lie there go carry them and smear the sleepy grooms with blood
i’ll go no more i am afraid to think what i have done look on’t again i dare not
the sleeping and the dead are but as pictures
’tis the eye of childhood that fears a painted devil
if he do bleed i’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal for it must seem their guilt
how is’t with me when every noise appals me
ha they pluck out mine eyes
will all great neptune’s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand
no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green one red
my hands are of your color but i shame to wear a heart so white
knocking within i hear knocking at the south entry —retire we to our chamber
a little water clears us of this deed how easy is it then
your constancy hath left you unattended — knocking within hark more knocking
get on your nightgown lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts

was it so late friend ere you went to bed that you do lie so late
faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three things
what three things does drink especially provoke
marry sir nose painting sleep and urine
lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance
therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night
that it did sir i’ the very throat on me but i requited him for his lie and i think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet i made a shift to cast him
our knocking has awak’d him here he comes
is the king stirring worthy thane
he did command me to call timely on him
i have almost slipp’d the hour
i know this is a joyful trouble to you but yet ’tis one
the labour we delight in physics pain
i’ll make so bold to call
the night has been unruly where we lay our chimneys were blown down and as they say lamentings heard i’ th’ air strange screams of death and prophesying with accents terrible of dire combustion and confus’d events new hatch’d to the woeful time
the obscure bird clamour’d the live long night
some say the earth was feverous and did shake

those of his chamber as it seem’d had done’t their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood so were their daggers which unwip’d we found upon their pillows
they star’d and were distracted no man’s life was to be trusted with them
o yet i do repent me of my fury that i did kill them
who can be wise amaz’d temperate and furious loyal and neutral in a moment
no man th’ expedition of my violent love outrun the pauser reason
here lay duncan his silver skin lac’d with his golden blood and his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature for ruin’s wasteful entrance there the murderers steep’d in the colours of their trade their daggers unmannerly breech’d with gore
who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make’s love known
why do we hold our tongues that most may claim this argument for ours
what should be spoken here where our fate hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
our tears are not yet brew’d
nor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion
look to the lady — lady macbeth is carried out and when we have our naked frailties hid that suffer in exposure let us meet and question this most bloody piece of work to know it further

our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer
where we are there’s daggers in men’s smiles the near in blood the nearer bloody

therefore to horse and let us not be dainty of leave taking but shift away
there’s warrant in that theft which steals itself when there’s no mercy left
enter ross and an old man
threescore and ten i can remember well within the volume of which time i have seen hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night hath trifled former knowings
ha good father thou seest the heavens as troubled with man’s act threatens his bloody stage by the clock ’tis day and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
is’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame that darkness does the face of earth entomb when living light should kiss it
’tis unnatural even like the deed that’s done
on tuesday last a falcon towering in her pride of place was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d
and duncan’s horses a thing most strange and certain beauteous and swift the minions of their race turn’d wild in nature broke their stalls flung out contending ’gainst obedience as they would make war with mankind
’tis said they eat each other
they did so to the amazement of mine eyes that look’d upon’t
how goes the world sir now
is’t known who did this more than bloody deed
malcolm and donalbain the king’s two sons are stol’n away and fled which puts upon them suspicion of the deed

as far my lord as will fill up the time ’twixt this and supper go not my horse the better i must become a borrower of the night for a dark hour or twain
we hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d in england and in ireland not confessing their cruel parricide filling their hearers with strange invention
but of that tomorrow when therewithal we shall have cause of state craving us jointly
hie you to horse adieu till you return at night
ay my good lord our time does call upon’s
i wish your horses swift and sure of foot and so i do commend you to their backs
farewell — exit banquo let every man be master of his time till seven at night to make society the sweeter welcome we will keep ourself till supper time alone while then god be with you
exeunt lady macbeth lords c sirrah a word with you
they are my lord without the palace gate
exit servant to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus
our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear’d ’tis much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety
there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuk’d as it is said mark antony’s was by caesar
he chid the sisters when first they put the name of king upon me and bade them speak to him then prophet like they hail’d him father to a line of kings upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown and put a barren sceptre in my gripe thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand no son of mine succeeding
if’t be so for banquo’s issue have i fil’d my mind for them the gracious duncan have i murder’d put rancours in the vessel of my peace only for them and mine eternal jewel given to the common enemy of man to make them kings the seed of banquo kings
rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to th’ utterance —who’s there — enter servant with two murderers
now go to the door and stay there till we call
exit servant was it not yesterday we spoke together
it was so please your highness
well then now have you consider’d of my speeches
know that it was he in the times past which held you so under fortune which you thought had been our innocent self
this i made good to you in our last conference pass’d in probation with you how you were borne in hand how cross’d the instruments who wrought with them and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion craz’d say “thus did banquo ” first murderer
you made it known to us
i did so and went further which is now our point of second meeting
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go
are you so gospell’d to pray for this good man and for his issue whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave and beggar’d yours forever
ay in the catalogue ye go for men as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept all by the name of dogs the valu’d file distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle the housekeeper the hunter every one according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him clos’d whereby he does receive particular addition from the bill that writes them all alike and so of men
now if you have a station in the file not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood say’t and i will put that business in your bosoms whose execution takes your enemy off grapples you to the heart and love of us who wear our health but sickly in his life which in his death were perfect
i am one my liege whom the vile blows and buffets of the world hath so incens’d that i am reckless what i do to spite the world
and i another so weary with disasters tugg’d with fortune that i would set my life on any chance to mend it or be rid on’t
both of you know banquo was your enemy
so is he mine and in such bloody distance that every minute of his being thrusts against my near’st of life and though i could with barefac’d power sweep him from my sight and bid my will avouch it yet i must not for certain friends that are both his and mine whose loves i may not drop but wail his fall who i myself struck down and thence it is that i to your assistance do make love masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons
we shall my lord perform what you command us
within this hour at most i will advise you where to plant yourselves acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time the moment on’t for’t must be done tonight and something from the palace always thought that i require a clearness
and with him to leave no rubs nor botches in the work fleance his son that keeps him company whose absence is no less material to me than is his father’s must embrace the fate of that dark hour
i’ll call upon you straight abide within
banquo thy soul’s flight if it find heaven must find it out tonight
enter lady macbeth and a servant
ay madam but returns again tonight
say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words
naught’s had all’s spent where our desire is got without content ’tis safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
how now my lord why do you keep alone of sorriest fancies your companions making using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on
things without all remedy should be without regard what’s done is done
we have scorch’d the snake not kill’d it
she’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth
but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly
better be with the dead whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy
duncan is in his grave after life’s fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further
come on gently my lord sleek o’er your rugged looks be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
so shall i love and so i pray be you
let your remembrance apply to banquo present him eminence both with eye and tongue unsafe the while that we must lave our honours in these flattering streams and make our faces vizards to our hearts disguising what they are
o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
thou know’st that banquo and his fleance lives
but in them nature’s copy’s not eterne
there’s comfort yet they are assailable
ere the bat hath flown his cloister’d flight ere to black hecate’s summons the shard born beetle with his drowsy hums hath rung night’s yawning peal there shall be done a deed of dreadful note
be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck till thou applaud the deed
come seeling night scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale —light thickens and the crow makes wing to th’ rooky wood
good things of day begin to droop and drowse whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse
thou marvell’st at my words but hold thee still things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
a park or lawn with a gate leading to the palace
but who did bid thee join with us
he needs not our mistrust since he delivers our offices and what we have to do to the direction just
the west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
now spurs the lated traveller apace to gain the timely inn and near approaches the subject of our watch
within give us a light there ho
then ’tis he the rest that are within the note of expectation already are i’ th’ court
almost a mile but he does usually so all men do from hence to the palace gate make it their walk
enter banquo and fleance with a torch
fly good fleance fly fly fly
who did strike out the light
there’s but one down the son is fled
we have lost best half of our affair
well let’s away and say how much is done
a room of state in the palace
enter macbeth lady macbeth ross lennox lords and attendants
you know your own degrees sit down
at first and last the hearty welcome
ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host
our hostess keeps her state but in best time we will require her welcome
pronounce it for me sir to all our friends for my heart speaks they are welcome
enter first murderer to the door
see they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks
both sides are even here i’ll sit i’ th’ midst
be large in mirth anon we’ll drink a measure the table round
’tis better thee without than he within
my lord his throat is cut
thou art the best o’ th’ cut throats yet he’s good that did the like for fleance if thou didst it thou art the nonpareil
most royal sir fleance is ’scap’d
then comes my fit again i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as broad and general as the casing air but now i am cabin’d cribb’d confin’d bound in to saucy doubts and fears
safe in a ditch he bides with twenty trenched gashes on his head the least a death to nature
there the grown serpent lies the worm that’s fled hath nature that in time will venom breed no teeth for th’ present —get thee gone tomorrow we’ll hear ourselves again
my royal lord you do not give the cheer the feast is sold that is not often vouch’d while ’tis a making ’tis given with welcome
to feed were best at home from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony meeting were bare without it
the ghost of banquo rises and sits in macbeth’s place
sweet remembrancer — now good digestion wait on appetite and health on both
here had we now our country’s honour roof’d were the grac’d person of our banquo present who may i rather challenge for unkindness than pity for mischance
his absence sir lays blame upon his promise
please’t your highness to grace us with your royal company
here is a place reserv’d sir
what is’t that moves your highness
which of you have done this
thou canst not say i did it
never shake thy gory locks at me
gentlemen rise his highness is not well
my lord is often thus and hath been from his youth pray you keep seat the fit is momentary upon a thought he will again be well
if much you note him you shall offend him and extend his passion
feed and regard him not —are you a man
ay and a bold one that dare look on that which might appal the devil
this is the very painting of your fear this is the air drawn dagger which you said led you to duncan
o these flaws and starts impostors to true fear would well become a woman’s story at a winter’s fire authoris’d by her grandam
why do you make such faces
when all’s done you look but on a stool
if thou canst nod speak too — if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back our monuments shall be the maws of kites
if i stand here i saw him
blood hath been shed ere now i’ th’ olden time ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been perform’d too terrible for the ear the time has been that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns and push us from our stools
this is more strange than such a murder is
my worthy lord your noble friends do lack you
i do forget — do not muse at me my most worthy friends
i have a strange infirmity which is nothing to those that know me
come love and health to all then i’ll sit down —give me some wine fill full — i drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table and to our dear friend banquo whom we miss would he were here
to all and him we thirst and all to all
thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with
think of this good peers but as a thing of custom ’tis no other only it spoils the pleasure of the time
what man dare i dare approach thou like the rugged russian bear the arm’d rhinoceros or th’ hyrcan tiger take any shape but that and my firm nerves shall never tremble or be alive again and dare me to the desert with thy sword if trembling i inhabit then protest me the baby of a girl
ghost disappears why so —being gone i am a man again —pray you sit still
you have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting with most admir’d disorder
can such things be and overcome us like a summer’s cloud without our special wonder
you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe when now i think you can behold such sights and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine are blanch’d with fear
i pray you speak not he grows worse and worse question enrages him
at once good night — stand not upon the order of your going but go at once
good night and better health attend his majesty
a kind good night to all
exeunt all lords and atendants macbeth
it will have blood they say blood will have blood
stones have been known to move and trees to speak augurs and understood relations have by magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret’st man of blood —what is the night
almost at odds with morning which is which
how say’st thou that macduff denies his person at our great bidding
did you send to him sir
i hear it by the way but i will send
there’s not a one of them but in his house i keep a servant fee’d
i will tomorrow and betimes i will to the weird sisters more shall they speak for now i am bent to know by the worst means the worst
for mine own good all causes shall give way i am in blood stepp’d in so far that should i wade no more returning were as tedious as go o’er
strange things i have in head that will to hand which must be acted ere they may be scann’d
you lack the season of all natures sleep
my strange and self abuse is the initiate fear that wants hard use
we are yet but young in deed
enter the three witches meeting hecate
have i not reason beldams as you are saucy and overbold
how did you dare to trade and traffic with macbeth in riddles and affairs of death and i the mistress of your charms the close contriver of all harms was never call’d to bear my part or show the glory of our art
and which is worse all you have done hath been but for a wayward son spiteful and wrathful who as others do loves for his own ends not for you
but make amends now get you gone and at the pit of acheron meet me i’ th’ morning thither he will come to know his destiny
your vessels and your spells provide your charms and everything beside
i am for th’ air this night i’ll spend unto a dismal and a fatal end
great business must be wrought ere noon
upon the corner of the moon there hangs a vap’rous drop profound i’ll catch it ere it come to ground and that distill’d by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion
he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear his hopes ’bove wisdom grace and fear
and you all know security is mortals’ chiefest enemy
music and song within “come away come away” c hark
i am call’d my little spirit see sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me
come let’s make haste she’ll soon be back again
my former speeches have but hit your thoughts which can interpret farther only i say thing’s have been strangely borne
the gracious duncan was pitied of macbeth —marry he was dead — and the right valiant banquo walk’d too late whom you may say if’t please you fleance kill’d for fleance fled
men must not walk too late
who cannot want the thought how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father
did he not straight in pious rage the two delinquents tear that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
ay and wisely too for ’twould have anger’d any heart alive to hear the men deny’t
so that i say he has borne all things well and i do think that had he duncan’s sons under his key as and’t please heaven he shall not they should find what ’twere to kill a father so should fleance
but peace —for from broad words and ’cause he fail’d his presence at the tyrant’s feast i hear macduff lives in disgrace
sir can you tell where he bestows himself
the son of duncan from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth lives in the english court and is receiv’d of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect
thither macduff is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid to wake northumberland and warlike siward that by the help of these with him above to ratify the work we may again give to our tables meat sleep to our nights free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives do faithful homage and receive free honours all which we pine for now
and this report hath so exasperate the king that he prepares for some attempt of war
he did and with an absolute “sir not i ” the cloudy messenger turns me his back and hums as who should say “you’ll rue the time that clogs me with this answer ” lennox
and that well might advise him to a caution t’ hold what distance his wisdom can provide
some holy angel fly to the court of england and unfold his message ere he come that a swift blessing may soon return to this our suffering country under a hand accurs’d
i’ll send my prayers with him
in the middle a cauldron boiling
thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d
thrice and once the hedge pig whin’d
harpier cries —’tis time ’tis time
round about the cauldron go in the poison’d entrails throw — toad that under cold stone days and nights has thirty one swelter’d venom sleeping got boil thou first i’ th’ charmed pot
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
fillet of a fenny snake in the cauldron boil and bake eye of newt and toe of frog wool of bat and tongue of dog adder’s fork and blind worm’s sting lizard’s leg and howlet’s wing for a charm of powerful trouble like a hell broth boil and bubble
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
scale of dragon tooth of wolf witch’s mummy maw and gulf of the ravin’d salt sea shark root of hemlock digg’d i’ th’ dark liver of blaspheming jew gall of goat and slips of yew sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse nose of turk and tartar’s lips finger of birth strangled babe ditch deliver’d by a drab make the gruel thick and slab add thereto a tiger’s chaudron for th’ ingredients of our cauldron
double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble
cool it with a baboon’s blood
then the charm is firm and good
i commend your pains and everyone shall share i’ th’ gains
and now about the cauldron sing like elves and fairies in a ring enchanting all that you put in
music and a song “black spirits ” c exit hecate second witch
by the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes
how now you secret black and midnight hags
i conjure you by that which you profess howe’er you come to know it answer me though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches though the yesty waves confound and swallow navigation up though bladed corn be lodg’d and trees blown down though castles topple on their warders’ heads though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations though the treasure of nature’s germens tumble all together even till destruction sicken answer me to what i ask you
say if thou’dst rather hear it from our mouths or from our masters
call ’em let me see ’em
pour in sow’s blood that hath eaten her nine farrow grease that’s sweaten from the murderer’s gibbet throw into the flame
come high or low thyself and office deftly show
an apparition of an armed head rises macbeth
tell me thou unknown power — first witch
he knows thy thought hear his speech but say thou naught
beware macduff beware the thane of fife —dismiss me —enough
whate’er thou art for thy good caution thanks thou hast harp’d my fear aright —but one word more
here’s another more potent than the first
an apparition of a bloody child rises apparition
had i three ears i’d hear thee
laugh to scorn the power of man for none of woman born shall harm macbeth
then live macduff what need i fear of thee
but yet i’ll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate
thou shalt not live that i may tell pale hearted fear it lies and sleep in spite of thunder
an apparition of a child crowned with a tree in his hand rises what is this that rises like the issue of a king and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty
be lion mettled proud and take no care who chafes who frets or where conspirers are macbeth shall never vanquish’d be until great birnam wood to high dunsinane hill shall come against him
that will never be who can impress the forest bid the tree unfix his earth bound root
rebellious head rise never till the wood of birnam rise and our high plac’d macbeth shall live the lease of nature pay his breath to time and mortal custom —yet my heart throbs to know one thing tell me if your art can tell so much shall banquo’s issue ever reign in this kingdom
i will be satisfied deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you
show his eyes and grieve his heart come like shadows so depart
a show of eight kings appear and pass over in order the last with a glass in his hand banquo following macbeth
thou are too like the spirit of banquo
thy crown does sear mine eyeballs —and thy hair thou other gold bound brow is like the first
a third is like the former —filthy hags
why do you show me this —a fourth —start eyes
what will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom
another yet —a seventh —i’ll see no more — and yet the eighth appears who bears a glass which shows me many more and some i see that twofold balls and treble sceptres carry
horrible sight —now i see ’tis true for the blood bolter’d banquo smiles upon me and points at them for his —what
ay sir all this is so —but why stands macbeth thus amazedly — come sisters cheer we up his sprites and show the best of our delights
i’ll charm the air to give a sound while you perform your antic round that this great king may kindly say our duties did his welcome pay
the witches dance and vanish macbeth
gone —let this pernicious hour stand aye accursed in the calendar — come in without there
infected be the air whereon they ride and damn’d all those that trust them —i did hear the galloping of horse who was’t came by
’tis two or three my lord that bring you word macduff is fled to england
time thou anticipat’st my dread exploits the flighty purpose never is o’ertook unless the deed go with it
from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand
and even now to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done the castle of macduff i will surprise seize upon fife give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword his wife his babes and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line
no boasting like a fool this deed i’ll do before this purpose cool but no more sights —where are these gentlemen
come bring me where they are
enter lady macduff her son and ross
what had he done to make him fly the land
he had none his flight was madness when our actions do not our fears do make us traitors
you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear
to leave his wife to leave his babes his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly
he loves us not he wants the natural touch for the poor wren the most diminutive of birds will fight her young ones in her nest against the owl
all is the fear and nothing is the love as little is the wisdom where the flight so runs against all reason
my dearest coz i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits o’ th’ season
i dare not speak much further but cruel are the times when we are traitors and do not know ourselves when we hold rumour from what we fear yet know not what we fear but float upon a wild and violent sea each way and move—i take my leave of you shall not be long but i’ll be here again
things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before —my pretty cousin blessing upon you
father’d he is and yet he’s fatherless
i am so much a fool should i stay longer it would be my disgrace and your discomfort i take my leave at once
and what will you do now
with what i get i mean and so do they
thou’dst never fear the net nor lime the pit fall nor the gin
poor birds they are not set for
my father is not dead for all your saying
yes he is dead how wilt thou do for a father
nay how will you do for a husband
why i can buy me twenty at any market
then you’ll buy ’em to sell again
thou speak’st with all thy wit and yet i’ faith with wit enough for thee
was my father a traitor mother
why one that swears and lies
and be all traitors that do so
every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie
then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them
now god help thee poor monkey
but how wilt thou do for a father
if he were dead you’ld weep for him if you would not it were a good sign that i should quickly have a new father
i am not to you known though in your state of honour i am perfect
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly if you will take a homely man’s advice be not found here hence with your little ones
to fright you thus methinks i am too savage to do worse to you were fell cruelty which is too nigh your person
but i remember now i am in this earthly world where to do harm is often laudable to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly why then alas do i put up that womanly defence to say i have done no harm
i hope in no place so unsanctified where such as thou mayst find him
thou liest thou shag ear’d villain
stabbing him young fry of treachery
he has kill’d me mother run away i pray you
exit lady macduff crying “murder ” and pursued by the murderers scene iii
let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty
let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men bestride our down fall’n birthdom
each new morn new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows strike heaven on the face that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yell’d out like syllable of dolour
what i believe i’ll wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will
what you have spoke it may be so perchance
this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he hath not touch’d you yet
i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge
but i shall crave your pardon
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
angels are bright still though the brightest fell though all things foul would wear the brows of grace yet grace must still look so
perchance even there where i did find my doubts
why in that rawness left you wife and child those precious motives those strong knots of love without leave taking —i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties
you may be rightly just whatever i shall think
great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure for goodness dare not check thee
wear thou thy wrongs the title is affeer’d —fare thee well lord i would not be the villain that thou think’st for the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp and the rich east to boot
be not offended i speak not as in absolute fear of you
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke it weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash is added to her wounds
i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands but for all this when i shall tread upon the tyrant’s head or wear it on my sword yet my poor country shall have more vices than it had before more suffer and more sundry ways than ever by him that shall succeed
it is myself i mean in whom i know all the particulars of vice so grafted that when they shall be open’d black macbeth will seem as pure as snow and the poor state esteem him as a lamb being compar’d with my confineless harms
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d in evils to top macbeth
i grant him bloody luxurious avaricious false deceitful sudden malicious smacking of every sin that has a name but there’s no bottom none in my voluptuousness your wives your daughters your matrons and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust and my desire all continent impediments would o’erbear that did oppose my will better macbeth than such an one to reign
boundless intemperance in nature is a tyranny it hath been th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne and fall of many kings
but fear not yet to take upon you what is yours you may convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty and yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink
we have willing dames enough there cannot be that vulture in you to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves finding it so inclin’d
with this there grows in my most ill compos’d affection such a staunchless avarice that were i king i should cut off the nobles for their lands desire his jewels and this other’s house and my more having would be as a sauce to make me hunger more that i should forge quarrels unjust against the good and loyal destroying them for wealth
this avarice sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root than summer seeming lust and it hath been the sword of our slain kings yet do not fear scotland hath foisons to fill up your will of your mere own
all these are portable with other graces weigh’d
but i have none the king becoming graces as justice verity temp’rance stableness bounty perseverance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude i have no relish of them but abound in the division of each several crime acting it many ways
nay had i power i should pour the sweet milk of concord into hell uproar the universal peace confound all unity on earth
if such a one be fit to govern speak i am as i have spoken
no not to live —o nation miserable with an untitled tyrant bloody scepter’d when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again since that the truest issue of thy throne by his own interdiction stands accus’d and does blaspheme his breed
thy royal father was a most sainted king
the queen that bore thee oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet died every day she lived
these evils thou repeat’st upon thyself have banish’d me from scotland —o my breast thy hope ends here
macduff this noble passion child of integrity hath from my soul wiped the black scruples reconcil’d my thoughts to thy good truth and honour
devilish macbeth by many of these trains hath sought to win me into his power and modest wisdom plucks me from over credulous haste but god above deal between thee and me
for even now i put myself to thy direction and unspeak mine own detraction here abjure the taints and blames i laid upon myself for strangers to my nature
i am yet unknown to woman never was forsworn scarcely have coveted what was mine own at no time broke my faith would not betray the devil to his fellow and delight no less in truth than life my first false speaking was this upon myself
what i am truly is thine and my poor country’s to command whither indeed before thy here approach old siward with ten thousand warlike men already at a point was setting forth
now we’ll together and the chance of goodness be like our warranted quarrel
such welcome and unwelcome things at once ’tis hard to reconcile
well more anon —comes the king forth i pray you
there are a crew of wretched souls that stay his cure their malady convinces the great assay of art but at his touch such sanctity hath heaven given his hand they presently amend
’tis call’d the evil a most miraculous work in this good king which often since my here remain in england i have seen him do
how he solicits heaven himself best knows but strangely visited people all swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye the mere despair of surgery he cures hanging a golden stamp about their necks put on with holy prayers and ’tis spoken to the succeeding royalty he leaves the healing benediction
with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace
my countryman but yet i know him not
my ever gentle cousin welcome hither
good god betimes remove the means that makes us strangers
alas poor country almost afraid to know itself
it cannot be call’d our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air are made not mark’d where violent sorrow seems a modern ecstasy
the dead man’s knell is there scarce ask’d for who and good men’s lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken
o relation too nice and yet too true
that of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker each minute teems a new one
the tyrant has not batter’d at their peace
no they were well at peace when i did leave ’em
be not a niggard of your speech how goes’t
when i came hither to transport the tidings which i have heavily borne there ran a rumour of many worthy fellows that were out which was to my belief witness’d the rather for that i saw the tyrant’s power afoot
now is the time of help
your eye in scotland would create soldiers make our women fight to doff their dire distresses
be’t their comfort we are coming thither
gracious england hath lent us good siward and ten thousand men an older and a better soldier none that christendom gives out
would i could answer this comfort with the like
but i have words that would be howl’d out in the desert air where hearing should not latch them
or is it a fee grief due to some single breast
no mind that’s honest but in it shares some woe though the main part pertains to you alone
if it be mine keep it not from me quickly let me have it
let not your ears despise my tongue for ever which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard
your castle is surpris’d your wife and babes savagely slaughter’d
to relate the manner were on the quarry of these murder’d deer to add the death of you
ne’er pull your hat upon your brows
the grief that does not speak whispers the o’er fraught heart and bids it break
wife children servants all that could be found
and i must be from thence
be comforted let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge to cure this deadly grief
he has no children —all my pretty ones
did you say all —o hell kite —all
what all my pretty chickens and their dam at one fell swoop
i shall do so but i must also feel it as a man i cannot but remember such things were that were most precious to me —did heaven look on and would not take their part
sinful macduff they were all struck for thee
naught that i am not for their own demerits but for mine fell slaughter on their souls heaven rest them now
be this the whetstone of your sword
let grief convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
o i could play the woman with mine eyes and braggart with my tongue —but gentle heavens cut short all intermission front to front bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself within my sword’s length set him if he ’scape heaven forgive him too
come go we to the king
our power is ready our lack is nothing but our leave
macbeth is ripe for shaking and the powers above put on their instruments
receive what cheer you may the night is long that never finds the day
exeunt act v scene i dunsinane
enter a doctor of physic and a waiting gentlewoman
i have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report
when was it she last walked
since his majesty went into the field i have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon’t read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
a great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching
in this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say
that sir which i will not report after her
you may to me and ’tis most meet you should
neither to you nor anyone having no witness to confirm my speech
enter lady macbeth with a taper
this is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep
how came she by that light
why it stood by her she has light by her continually ’tis her command
you see her eyes are open
ay but their sense are shut
what is it she does now
look how she rubs her hands
it is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands
i have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour
i will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
why then ’tis time to do’t
what need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account
yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him
the thane of fife had a wife
where is she now —what will these hands ne’er be clean
no more o’ that my lord no more o’ that you mar all with this starting
you have known what you should not
she has spoke what she should not i am sure of that heaven knows what she has known
here’s the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body
this disease is beyond my practice yet i have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds
wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so pale
i tell you yet again banquo’s buried he cannot come out on’s grave
come come come come give me your hand
to bed to bed to bed
will she go now to bed
unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
more needs she the divine than the physician — god god forgive us all
look after her remove from her the means of all annoyance and still keep eyes upon her
so good night my mind she has mated and amaz’d my sight
i think but dare not speak
enter with drum and colours menteith caithness angus lennox and soldiers
the english power is near led on by malcolm his uncle siward and the good macduff
revenges burn in them for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man
near birnam wood shall we well meet them
who knows if donalbain be with his brother
for certain sir he is not
i have a file of all the gentry there is siward’s son and many unrough youths that even now protest their first of manhood
some say he’s mad others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury but for certain he cannot buckle his distemper’d cause within the belt of rule
now does he feel his secret murders sticking on his hands now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach those he commands move only in command nothing in love now does he feel his title hang loose about him like a giant’s robe upon a dwarfish thief
who then shall blame his pester’d senses to recoil and start when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there
well march we on to give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal and with him pour we in our country’s purge each drop of us
or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
make we our march towards birnam
bring me no more reports let them fly all till birnam wood remove to dunsinane i cannot taint with fear
was he not born of woman
the spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus “fear not macbeth no man that’s born of woman shall e’er have power upon thee ”—then fly false thanes and mingle with the english epicures the mind i sway by and the heart i bear shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear
the devil damn thee black thou cream fac’d loon
where gott’st thou that goose look
go prick thy face and over red thy fear thou lily liver’d boy
those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear
the english force so please you
exit servant seyton —i am sick at heart when i behold—seyton i say —this push will cheer me ever or disseat me now
i have liv’d long enough my way of life is fall’n into the sere the yellow leaf and that which should accompany old age as honour love obedience troops of friends i must not look to have but in their stead curses not loud but deep mouth honour breath which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
all is confirm’d my lord which was reported
i’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack’d
send out more horses skirr the country round hang those that talk of fear
give me mine armour — how does your patient doctor
not so sick my lord as she is troubled with thick coming fancies that keep her from her rest
cure her of that canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart
therein the patient must minister to himself
throw physic to the dogs i’ll none of it
come put mine armour on give me my staff seyton send out —doctor the thanes fly from me — come sir despatch —if thou couldst doctor cast the water of my land find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health i would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again —pull’t off i say — what rhubarb senna or what purgative drug would scour these english hence
your royal preparation makes us hear something
bring it after me — i will not be afraid of death and bane till birnam forest come to dunsinane
were i from dunsinane away and clear profit again should hardly draw me here
country near dunsinane a wood in view
enter with drum and colours malcolm old siward and his son macduff menteith caithness angus lennox ross and soldiers marching
cousins i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe
what wood is this before us
let every soldier hew him down a bough and bear’t before him
thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us
we learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane and will endure our setting down before’t
’tis his main hope for where there is advantage to be given both more and less have given him the revolt and none serve with him but constrained things whose hearts are absent too
let our just censures attend the true event and put we on industrious soldiership
the time approaches that will with due decision make us know what we shall say we have and what we owe
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate but certain issue strokes must arbitrate towards which advance the war
enter with drum and colours macbeth seyton and soldiers
hang out our banners on the outward walls the cry is still “they come ” our castle’s strength will laugh a siege to scorn here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up
were they not forc’d with those that should be ours we might have met them dareful beard to beard and beat them backward home
a cry of women within what is that noise
it is the cry of women my good lord
i have almost forgot the taste of fears
the time has been my senses would have cool’d to hear a night shriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in’t
i have supp’d full with horrors direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me
the queen my lord is dead
there would have been a time for such a word
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death
life’s but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
thou com’st to use thy tongue thy story quickly
gracious my lord i should report that which i say i saw but know not how to do’t
as i did stand my watch upon the hill i look’d toward birnam and anon methought the wood began to move
let me endure your wrath if’t be not so
within this three mile may you see it coming i say a moving grove
if thou speak’st false upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth i care not if thou dost for me as much — i pull in resolution and begin to doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth
“fear not till birnam wood do come to dunsinane ” and now a wood comes toward dunsinane —arm arm and out — if this which he avouches does appear there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
i ’gin to be aweary of the sun and wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone — ring the alarum bell —blow wind
at least we’ll die with harness on our back
enter with drum and colours malcolm old siward macduff and their army with boughs
your leafy screens throw down and show like those you are —you worthy uncle shall with my cousin your right noble son lead our first battle worthy macduff and we shall take upon’s what else remains to do according to our order
fare you well — do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight let us be beaten if we cannot fight
make all our trumpets speak give them all breath those clamorous harbingers of blood and death
they have tied me to a stake
i cannot fly but bear like i must fight the course —what’s he that was not born of woman
such a one am i to fear or none
thou’lt be afraid to hear it
no though thou call’st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell
the devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear
with my sword i’ll prove the lie thou speak’st
they fight and young siward is slain macbeth
but swords i smile at weapons laugh to scorn brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born
that way the noise is —tyrant show thy face
if thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mine my wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still
i cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms are hired to bear their staves
either thou macbeth or else my sword with an unbatter’d edge i sheathe again undeeded
there thou shouldst be by this great clatter one of greatest note seems bruited
alarums enter malcolm and old siward
this way my lord —the castle’s gently render’d the tyrant’s people on both sides do fight the noble thanes do bravely in the war the day almost itself professes yours and little is to do
we have met with foes that strike beside us
why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword
whiles i see lives the gashes do better upon them
of all men else i have avoided thee but get thee back my soul is too much charg’d with blood of thine already
i have no words my voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out
thou losest labour as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests i bear a charmed life which must not yield to one of woman born
despair thy charm and let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d tell thee macduff was from his mother’s womb untimely ripp’d
accursed be that tongue that tells me so for it hath cow’d my better part of man
and be these juggling fiends no more believ’d that palter with us in a double sense that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope —i’ll not fight with thee
then yield thee coward and live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time
we’ll have thee as our rarer monsters are painted upon a pole and underwrit “here may you see the tyrant ” macbeth
i will not yield to kiss the ground before young malcolm’s feet and to be baited with the rabble’s curse
though birnam wood be come to dunsinane and thou oppos’d being of no woman born yet i will try the last
before my body i throw my warlike shield lay on macduff and damn’d be him that first cries “hold enough ” exeunt fighting
enter with drum and colours malcolm old siward ross thanes and soldiers
i would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d
some must go off and yet by these i see so great a day as this is cheaply bought
macduff is missing and your noble son
your son my lord has paid a soldier’s debt he only liv’d but till he was a man the which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d in the unshrinking station where he fought but like a man he died
ay and brought off the field
your cause of sorrow must not be measur’d by his worth for then it hath no end
why then god’s soldier be he
had i as many sons as i have hairs i would not wish them to a fairer death and so his knell is knoll’d
he’s worth more sorrow and that i’ll spend for him
they say he parted well and paid his score and so god be with him —here comes newer comfort
hail king for so thou art
behold where stands th’ usurper’s cursed head the time is free
i see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl that speak my salutation in their minds whose voices i desire aloud with mine — hail king of scotland
we shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you
my thanes and kinsmen henceforth be earls the first that ever scotland in such an honour nam’d
what’s more to do which would be planted newly with the time — as calling home our exil’d friends abroad that fled the snares of watchful tyranny producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen who as ’tis thought by self and violent hands took off her life —this and what needful else that calls upon us by the grace of grace we will perform in measure time and place
so thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crown’d at scone

of government the properties to unfold would seem in me t affect speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work
the nature of our people our city s institutions and the terms for common justice y are as pregnant in as art and practice hath enriched any that we remember
there is our commission from which we would not have you warp
call hither i say bid come before us angelo
exit an attendant what figure of us think you he will bear
for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dress d him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power
if any in vienna be of worth to undergo such ample grace and honour it is lord angelo
always obedient to your grace s will i come to know your pleasure
angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to th observer doth thy history fully unfold
thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike as if we had them not
spirits are not finely touch d but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use
but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise
hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart
old escalus though first in question is thy secondary
now good my lord let there be some more test made of my metal before so noble and so great a figure be stamp d upon it
we have with a leaven d and prepared choice proceeded to you therefore take your honours
our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestion d matters of needful value
we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here
to th hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions
yet give leave my lord that we may bring you something on the way
my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honour have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good
give me your hand i ll privily away
i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes though it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it
the heavens give safety to your purposes
lead forth and bring you back in happiness
i shall desire you sir to give me leave to have free speech with you and it concerns me to look into the bottom of my place a pow r i have but of what strength and nature i am not yet instructed
let us withdraw together and we may soon our satisfaction have touching that point
i ll wait upon your honour
a street enter lucio and two other gentlemen lucio
if the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king
heaven grant us its peace but not the king of hungary s
thou conclud st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scrap d one out of the table
why twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal
there s not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace
i never heard any soldier dislike it
i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said
in any proportion or in any language
i think or in any religion
grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace
well there went but a pair of shears between us
i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet
and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou rt a three pil d piece i warrant thee
i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be pil d as thou art pil d for a french velvet
i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech
i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee
i think i have done myself wrong have i not
yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free
behold behold where madam mitigation comes
i have purchas d as many diseases under her roof as come to second gentleman
to three thousand dolours a year
thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error i am sound
nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee
which of your hips has the most profound sciatica
there s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all
who s that i pray thee
marry sir that s claudio signior claudio
nay but i know tis so i saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopp d off
but after all this fooling i would not have it so
i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam julietta with child
believe me this may be he promis d to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise keeping
besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose
but most of all agreeing with the proclamation
away let s go learn the truth of it
exeunt lucio and gentlemen mrs overdone
thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty i am custom shrunk
what s the news with you
yonder man is carried to prison
groping for trouts in a peculiar river
is there a maid with child by him
no but there s a woman with maid by him
you have not heard of the proclamation have you
all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be pluck d down
and what shall become of those in the city
they shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them
but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pull d down
why here s a change indeed in the commonwealth
come fear not you good counsellors lack no clients
though you change your place you need not change your trade i ll be your tapster still
courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered
what s to do here thomas tapster
here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison and there s madam juliet
exeunt enter provost claudio juliet and officers lucio following claudio
fellow why dost thou show me thus to th world
bear me to prison where i am committed
i do it not in evil disposition but from lord angelo by special charge
thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven on whom it will it will on whom it will not so yet still tis just
why how now claudio whence comes this restraint
from too much liberty my lucio liberty as surfeit is the father of much fast so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint
our natures do pursue like rats that ravin down their proper bane a thirsty evil and when we drink we die
if i could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment
what but to speak of would offend again
a hundred if they ll do you any good
is lechery so look d after
thus stands it with me upon a true contract i got possession of julietta s bed
you know the lady she is fast my wife save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order this we came not to only for propagation of a dow r remaining in the coffer of her friends
from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us
but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet
and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his eminence that fills it up i stagger in
but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscour d armour hung by th wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me
i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off
send after the duke and appeal to him
i have done so but he s not to be found
i prithee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him
i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade
i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tack
i thank you good friend lucio
a monastery enter duke and friar thomas duke
no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom
why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth
may your grace speak of it
my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever lov d the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps
i have deliver d to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travell d to poland for so i have strew d it in the common ear and so it is received
now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this
we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds which for this fourteen years we have let slip even like an o ergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey
now as fond fathers having bound up the threat ning twigs of birch only to stick it in their children s sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mock d than fear d so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum
it rested in your grace to unloose this tied up justice when you pleas d and it in you more dreadful would have seem d than in lord angelo
sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment
therefore indeed my father i have on angelo impos d the office who may in th ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander
and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people
therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar
moe reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you
only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone
hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be
a nunnery enter isabella and francisca isabella
and have you nuns no farther privileges
yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare
it is a man s voice
gentle isabella turn you the key and know his business of him you may i may not you are yet unsworn when you have vow d you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress then if you speak you must not show your face or if you show your face you must not speak
he calls again i pray you answer him
hail virgin if you be as those cheek roses proclaim you are no less
can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio
let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister
gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
not to be weary with you he s in prison
for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child
sir make me not your story
i would not though tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heart play with all virgins so i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talk d with in sincerity as with a saint
you do blaspheme the good in mocking me
fewness and truth tis thus your brother and his lover have embrac d
as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
some one with child by him
adoptedly as school maids change their names by vain though apt affection
the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givings out were of an infinite distance from his true meant design
upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snow broth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast
he to give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lions hath pick d out an act under whose heavy sense your brother s life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example
all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo
and that s my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother
doth he so seek his life
has censur d him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution
what poor ability s in me to do him good
assay the pow r you have
our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt
go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them
i ll see what i can do
i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair
commend me to my brother soon at night i ll send him certain word of my success
i take my leave of you
a hall in angelo s house enter angelo escalus a justice provost officers and other attendants angelo
we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror
ay but yet let us be keen and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to death
this gentleman whom i would save had a most noble father
let but your honour know whom i believe to be most strait in virtue that in the working of your own affections had time coher d with place or place with wishing or that the resolute acting of our blood could have attain d th effect of your own purpose whether you had not sometime in your life err d in this point which now you censure him and pull d the law upon you
tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall
i not deny the jury passing on the prisoner s life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try
what s open made to justice that justice seizes
what knows the laws that thieves do pass on thieves
tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and take t because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it
you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial
be it as your wisdom will
here if it like your honour
see that claudio be executed by nine to morrow morning bring him his confessor let him be prepar d for that s the utmost of his pilgrimage
some rise by sin and some by virtue fall some run from breaks of ice and answer none and some condemned for a fault alone
enter elbow and officers with froth and pompey elbow
come bring them away if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses i know no law bring them away
what s your name and what s the matter
if it please your honour i am the poor duke s constable and my name is elbow i do lean upon justice sir and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors
if it please your honour i know not well what they are but precise villains they are that i am sure of and void of all profanation in the world that good christians ought to have
this comes off well here s a wise officer
go to what quality are they of
why dost thou not speak elbow
he cannot sir he s out at elbow

i say sir i will detest myself also as well as she that this house if it be not a bawd s house it is pity of her life for it is a naughty house
how dost thou know that constable
marry sir by my wife who if she had been a woman cardinally given might have been accus d in fornication adultery and all uncleanliness there
ay sir by mistress overdone s means but as she spit in his face so she defied him
sir if it please your honour this is not so
prove it before these varlets here thou honourable man prove it
do you hear how he misplaces
sir she came in great with child and longing saving your honour s reverence for stew d prunes

good then if his face be the worst thing about him how could master froth do the constable s wife any harm
i would know that of your honour
he s in the right constable what say you to it
first an it like you the house is a respected house next this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected woman
by this hand sir his wife is a more respected person than any of us all
varlet thou liest thou liest wicket varlet the time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man woman or child
sir she was respected with him before he married with her
which is the wiser here justice or iniquity
i respected with her before i was married to her
if ever i was respected with her or she with me let not your worship think me the poor duke s officer
prove this thou wicked hannibal or i ll have mine action of batt ry on thee
if he took you a box o th ear you might have your action of slander too
marry i thank your good worship for it
what is t your worship s pleasure i shall do with this wicked caitiff
truly officer because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst let him continue in his courses till thou know st what they are

well no more of it master froth farewell
exit froth come you hither to me master tapster what s your name master tapster
troth and your bum is the greatest thing about you so that in the beastliest sense you are pompey the great
pompey you are partly a bawd pompey howsoever you colour it in being a tapster
come tell me true it shall be the better for you
truly sir i am a poor fellow that would live
how would you live pompey by being a bawd
what do you think of the trade pompey
if the law would allow it sir
but the law will not allow it pompey nor it shall not be allowed in vienna
does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city
truly sir in my poor opinion they will to t then
if your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves you need not to fear the bawds
there is pretty orders beginning i can tell you but it is but heading and hanging
if you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together you ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads if this law hold in vienna ten year i ll rent the fairest house in it after threepence a bay
if you live to see this come to pass say pompey told you so
thank you good pompey and in requital of your prophecy hark you i advise you let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever no not for dwelling where you do if i do pompey i shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd caesar to you in plain dealing pompey i shall have you whipt
so for this time pompey fare you well
i thank your worship for your good counsel aside but i shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine
no no let carman whip his jade the valiant heart s not whipt out of his trade
come hither to me master elbow come hither master constable
how long have you been in this place of constable
seven year and a half sir
i thought by the readiness in the office you had continued in it some time
alas it hath been great pains to you
they do you wrong to put you so oft upon t
are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it
faith sir few of any wit in such matters as they are chosen they are glad to choose me for them i do it for some piece of money and go through with all
look you bring me in the names of some six or seven the most sufficient of your parish
to your worship s house sir
exit elbow what s o clock think you
i pray you home to dinner with me
it grieves me for the death of claudio but there s no remedy
it is but needful mercy is not itself that oft looks so pardon is still the nurse of second woe
another room in angelo s house enter provost and a servant servant
he s hearing of a cause he will come straight
i ll tell him of you
exit servant i ll know his pleasure may be he will relent
alas he hath but as offended in a dream
all sects all ages smack of this vice and he to die for t
now what s the matter provost
is it your will claudio shall die to morrow
did not i tell thee yea
lest i might be too rash under your good correction i have seen when after execution judgment hath repented o er his doom
go to let that be mine
do you your office or give up your place and you shall well be spar d
i crave your honour s pardon
what shall be done sir with the groaning juliet
she s very near her hour
dispose of her to some more fitter place and that with speed
here is the sister of the man condemn d desires access to you
ay my good lord a very virtuous maid and to be shortly of a sisterhood if not already
exit servant see you the fornicatress be remov d let her have needful but not lavish means there shall be order for t
to isabella y are welcome what s your will
i am a woeful suitor to your honour please but your honour hear me
there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war twixt will and will not
i have a brother is condemn d to die i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother
aside heaven give thee moving graces
condemn the fault and not the actor of it
why every fault s condemn d ere it be done mine were the very cipher of a function to fine the faults whose fine stands in record and let go by the actor
to isabella give t not o er so to him again entreat him kneel down before him hang upon his gown you are too cold if you should need a pin you could not with more tame a tongue desire it
yes i do think that you might pardon him
and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
but can you if you would
look what i will not that i cannot do
but might you do t and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touch d with that remorse as mine is to him
he s sentenc d tis too late
to isabella you are too cold
why no i that do speak a word may call it back again
well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the king s crown nor the deputed sword the marshal s truncheon nor the judge s robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does
if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipp d like him but he like you would not have been so stern
i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel
no i would tell what twere to be a judge and what a prisoner
to isabella ay touch him there s the vein
your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words
why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy
how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are
o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made
it is the law not i condemn your brother
were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him
he s not prepar d for death
even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves
good good my lord bethink you
who is it that hath died for this offence
there s many have committed it
the law hath not been dead though it hath slept
those many had not dar d to do that evil if the first that did th edict infringe had answer d for his deed
now tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils either now or by remissness new conceiv d and so in progress to be hatch d and born are now to have no successive degrees but here they live to end
i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismiss d offence would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another
be satisfied your brother dies to morrow be content
so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers
o it is excellent to have a giant s strength
but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant
to isabella that s well said
could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would never be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder
merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle
but man proud man dress d in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he s most assur d his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as makes the angels weep who with our speens would all themselves laugh mortal
to isabella o to him to him wench
he will relent he s coming i perceive t
aside pray heaven she win him
we cannot weigh our brother with ourself
great men may jest with saints tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation
to isabella thou rt i th right girl more o that
that in the captain s but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
to isabella art avis d o that
why do you put these sayings upon me
because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o th top
go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that s like my brother s fault
if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother s life
aside she speaks and tis such sense that my sense breeds with it fare you well
hark how i ll bribe you good my lord turn back
ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
to isabella you had marr d all else
not with fond sicles of the tested gold or stones whose rate are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sun rise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal
well come to me to morrow
to isabella go to tis well away
aside amen for i am that way going to temptation where prayers cross
at what hour to morrow shall i attend your lordship
from thee even from thy virtue
what s this what s this
is this her fault or mine
the tempter or the tempted who sins most
not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flow r corrupt with virtuous season
can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than woman s lightness
having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there
what dost thou or what art thou angelo
dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good
thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves
what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes
what is t i dream on
o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook
most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue
never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite
ever till now when men were fond i smil d and wond red how
a prison enter severally duke disguised as a friar and provost duke
what s your will good friar
bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison
do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly
i would do more than that if more were needful
enter juliet look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blister d her report
she is with child and he that got it sentenc d a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this
as i do think to morrow
to juliet i have provided for you stay awhile and you shall be conducted
repent you fair one of the sin you carry
i do and bear the shame most patiently
i ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on
love you the man that wrong d you
yes as i love the woman that wrong d him
so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed
then was your sin of heavier kind than his
i do confess it and repent it father
tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear juliet
i do repent me as it is an evil and take the shame with joy
your partner as i hear must die to morrow and i am going with instruction to him
o injurious law that respites me a life whose very comfort is still a dying horror
angelo s house enter angelo angelo
when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects
heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel
heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception
the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown sere and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain
o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming
let s write good angel on the devil s horn tis not the devil s crest
enter servant how now who s there
one isabel a sister desires access to you
why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness
so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a well wish d king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence
enter isabella how now fair maid
i am come to know your pleasure
that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis
yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die
i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not
it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stol n a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven s image in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one
tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
then i shall pose you quickly
which had you rather that the most just law now took your brother s life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath stain d
sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul
i talk not of your soul our compell d sins stand more for number than for accompt
nay i ll not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say
answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brother s life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brother s life
please you to do t i ll take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity
pleas d you to do t at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity
that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it
you granting of my suit if that be sin i ll make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer
nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and that s not good
let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better
thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder than beauty could display d
but mark me to be received plain i ll speak more gross your brother is to die
and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain
admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of question that you his sister finding yourself desir d of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the all binding law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do
as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death th impression of keen whips i d wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere i d yield my body up to shame
and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever
were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander d so
ignominy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption
you seem d of late to make the law a tyrant and rather prov d the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice
it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love
else let my brother die if not a fedary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness
ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms
men their creation mar in profiting by them
nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints
i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frames let me be bold
be that you are that is a woman if you be more you re none if you be one as you are well express d by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destin d livery
i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me intreat you speak the former language
my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for t
he shall not isabel if you give me love
i know your virtue hath a license in t which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others
believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose
little honour to be much believ d and most pernicious purpose
i will proclaim thee angelo look for t
sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch d throat i ll tell the world aloud what man thou art
my unsoil d name th austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i th state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny
i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to ling ring sufferance
answer me to morrow or by the affection that now guides me most i ll prove a tyrant to him
as for you say what you can my false o erweighs your true
did i tell this who would believe me
o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the self same tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make curtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to th appetite to follow as it draws
though he hath fall n by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks he d yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr d pollution
then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity
i ll tell him yet of angelo s request and fit his mind to death for his soul s rest
the prison enter duke disguised as before claudio and provost duke
so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo
the miserable have no other medicine but only hope i have hope to eve and am prepar d to die
be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter
if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep
a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keep st hourly afflict
merely thou art death s fool for him thou labour st by thy flight to shun and yet run st toward him still
thou art not noble for all th accommodations that thou bear st are nurs d by baseness
thou rt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm
thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok st yet grossly fear st thy death which is no more
thou art not thyself for thou exists on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust
happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou striv st to get and what thou hast forget st
thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon
if thou art rich thou rt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear st thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee
friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner
thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner s sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant
what s yet in this that bears the name of life
yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even
to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life
peace here grace and good company
come in the wish deserves a welcome
dear sir ere long i ll visit you again
most holy sir i thank you
my business is a word or two with claudio
look signior here s your sister
bring me to hear them speak where i may be conceal d
now sister what s the comfort
why as all comforts are most good most good indeed
lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger
therefore your best appointment make with speed to morrow you set on
none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain
yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you ll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death
ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world s vastidity you had to a determin d scope
in such a one as you consenting to t would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked
o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour
the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies
why give you me this shame
think you i can a resolution fetch from flow ry tenderness
if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms
there spake my brother there my father s grave did utter forth a voice
yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances
this outward sainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i th head and follies doth enew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell
o tis the cunning livery of hell the damned st body to invest and cover in precise guards
dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed
yes he would give t thee from this rank offence so to offend him still
this night s the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest to morrow
o were it but my life
i d throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin
be ready claudio for your death to morrow
has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by th nose when he would force it
sure it is no sin or of the deadly seven it is the least
if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fin d o isabel
ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thick ribbed ice to be imprison d in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible
the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death
what sin you do to save a brother s life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
is t not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister s shame
heaven shield my mother play d my father fair
for such a warped slip of wilderness ne er issu d from his blood
might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
i ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee
thy sin s not accidental but a trade
mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd tis best that thou diest quickly
vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit
i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile
son i have overheard what hath pass d between you and your sister
angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures
she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive
i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death
do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible to morrow you must die go to your knees and make ready
let me ask my sister pardon
i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it
exit claudio provost a word with you
that now you are come you will be gone
leave me a while with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company
the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair
the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath convey d to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo
how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother
i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born
but o how much is the good duke deceiv d in angelo
if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government
that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only
therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself
i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business
let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
virtue is bold and goodness never fearful
have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name
she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wreck d at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister
but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming angelo
left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestow d her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not
what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world
what corruption in this life that it will let this man live
but how out of this can she avail
it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it
this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly
go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience
this being granted in course and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place
if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled
the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt
if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof
the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection
it lies much in your holding up
haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction
i will presently to saint luke s there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana
at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly
i thank you for this comfort
the street before the prison enter on one side duke disguised as before on the other elbow and officers with pompey elbow
nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard
twas never merry world since of two usuries the merriest was put down and the worser allow d by order of law a furr d gown to keep him warm and furr d with fox on lamb skins too to signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing
what offence hath this man made you sir
marry sir he hath offended the law and sir we take him to be a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a strange picklock which we have sent to the deputy
fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd
the evil that thou causest to be done that is thy means to live
do thou but think what tis to cram a maw or clothe a back from such a filthy vice say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live
canst thou believe thy living is a life so stinkingly depending
indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir i would prove duke
nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin thou wilt prove his
take him to prison officer correction and instruction must both work ere this rude beast will profit
he must before the deputy sir he has given him warning
the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand
that we were all as some would seem to be from our faults as his faults from seeming free
his neck will come to your waist a cord sir
i spy comfort i cry bail
here s a gentleman and a friend of mine
what at the wheels of caesar
what is there none of pygmalion s images newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch d
what say st thou to this tune matter and method
is t not drown d i th last rain ha
is the world as it was man
is it sad and few words
still thus and thus still worse
how doth my dear morsel thy mistress
troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is herself in the tub
why tis good it is the right of it it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powder d bawd an unshunn d consequence it must be so
farewell go say i sent thee thither
for being a bawd for being a bawd
if imprisonment be the due of a bawd why tis his right
bawd is he doubtless and of antiquity too bawd born
commend me to the prison pompey
you will turn good husband now pompey you will keep the house
i hope sir your good worship will be my bail
no indeed will i not pompey it is not the wear
i will pray pompey to increase your bondage
if you take it not patiently why your mettle is the more
does bridget paint still pompey ha
you will not bail me then sir
exeunt elbow pompey and officers what news friar of the duke
can you tell me of any
some say he is with the emperor of russia other some he is in rome but where is he think you
i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well
it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to
lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to t
a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar
it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down
they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation
how should he be made then
some report a sea maid spawn d him some that he was begot between two stock fishes
but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal d ice that i know to be true
and he is a motion generative that s infallible
you are pleasant sir and speak apace
why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man
would the duke that is absent have done this
ere he would have hang d a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand
he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclin d that way
o sir you are deceiv d
yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish
the duke had crotchets in him
he would be drunk too that let me inform you
sir i was an inward of his
a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing
what i prithee might be the cause
no pardon tis a secret must be lock d within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise
why no question but he was
a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation
let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier
therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much dark ned in your malice
sir i know him and i love him
love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love
come sir i know what i know
i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak
but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him
if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name
sir my name is lucio well known to the duke
he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you
o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite
but indeed i can do you little harm you ll forswear this again
i ll be hang d first
thou art deceiv d in me friar
canst thou tell if claudio die to morrow or no
for filling a bottle with a tun dish
i would the duke we talk of were return d again
this ungenitur d agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house eaves because they are lecherous
the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light
marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing
farewell good friar i prithee pray for me
the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays
he s not past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic
no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape back wounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes
what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
enter escalus provost and officers with mistress overdone escalus
go away with her to prison
good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord
double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind
this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant
a bawd of eleven years continuance may it please your honour
my lord this is one lucio s information against me
mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the duke s time he promis d her marriage
his child is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
that fellow is a fellow of much license
let him be call d before us
exeunt officers with mistress overdone provost my brother angelo will not be alter d claudio must die to morrow
let him be furnish d with divines and have all charitable preparation
if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him
so please you this friar hath been with him and advis d him for th entertainment of death
not of this country though my chance is now to use it for my time
i am a brother of gracious order late come from the see in special business from his holiness
what news abroad i th world
none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it
novelty is only in request and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing
there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst
much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world
this news is old enough yet it is every day s news
i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself
what pleasure was he given to
rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at anything which profess d to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance
but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepar d
i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation
he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice
yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now he is resolv d to die
you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling
i have labour d for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forc d me to tell him he is indeed justice
if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenc d himself
i am going to visit the prisoner
exeunt escalus and provost he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by self offences weighing
shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking
twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow
o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side
how may likeness made in crimes make a practice on the times to draw with idle spiders strings most ponderous and substantial things
craft against vice i must apply
with angelo to night shall lie his old betrothed but despised so disguise shall by th disguised pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old contracting
the moated grange at saint duke s enter mariana and boy singing song take o take those lips away that so sweetly were forsworn and those eyes the break of day lights that do mislead the morn but my kisses bring again bring again seals of love but seal d in vain seal d in vain
enter duke disguised as before mariana
break off thy song and haste thee quick away here comes a man of comfort whose advice hath often still d my brawling discontent
exit boy i cry you mercy sir and well could wish you had not found me here so musical
let me excuse me and believe me so my mirth it much displeas d but pleas d my woe
tis good though music oft hath such a charm to make bad good and good provoke to harm
i pray you tell me hath anybody inquir d for me here to day
much upon this time have i promis d here to meet
you have not been inquir d after i have sat here all day
the time is come even now
i shall crave your forbearance a little
may be i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself
i am always bound to you
very well met and well come
what is the news from this good deputy
he hath a garden circummur d with brick whose western side is with a vineyard back d and to that vineyard is a planched gate that makes his opening with this bigger key this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads
there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him
but shall you on your knowledge find this way
i have ta en a due and wary note upon t with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice o er
are there no other tokens between you greed concerning her observance
no none but only a repair i th dark and that i have possess d him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother
i have not yet made known to mariana a word of this
re enter mariana i pray you be acquainted with this maid she comes to do you good
do you persuade yourself that i respect you
good friar i know you do and have found it
take then this your companion by the hand who hath a story ready for your ear
i shall attend your leisure but make haste the vaporous night approaches
will t please you walk aside
millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee
volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quest upon thy doings
thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dream and rack thee in their fancies
re enter mariana and isabella welcome how agreed
she ll take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it
it is not my consent but my entreaty too
little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low remember now my brother
nor gentle daughter fear you not at all
he is your husband on a pre contract
to bring you thus together tis no sin sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit
come let us go our corn s to reap for yet our tithe s to sow
the prison enter provost and pompey provost
can you cut off a man s head
if the man be a bachelor sir i can but if he be a married man he s his wife s head and i can never cut of a woman s head
come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer
to morrow morning are to die claudio and barnardine
here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd
sir i have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet i will be content to be a lawful hangman
i would be glad to receive some instructions from my fellow partner
sirrah here s a fellow will help you to morrow in your execution
if you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him
he cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd
go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale
pray sir by your good favour for surely sir a good favour you have but that you have a hanging look do you call sir your occupation a mystery
painting sir i have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in hanging if i should be hang d i cannot imagine
every true man s apparel fits your thief if it be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so every true man s apparel fits your thief
sir i will serve him for i do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgiveness
you sirrah provide your block and your axe to morrow four o clock
come on bawd i will instruct thee in my trade follow
i do desire to learn sir and i hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness i owe you a good turn
exeunt abhorson and pompey th one has my pity not a jot the other being a murderer though he were my brother
enter claudio look here s the warrant claudio for thy death tis now dead midnight and by eight to morrow thou must be made immortal
as fast lock d up in sleep as guiltless labour when it lies starkly in the traveller s bones
who can do good on him
knocking within but hark what noise
exit claudio knocking continues by and by
i hope it is some pardon or reprieve for the most gentle claudio
enter duke disguised as before welcome father
the best and wholesom st spirits of the night envelop you good provost
who call d here of late
they will then ere t be long
not so not so his life is parallel d even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his pow r to qualify in others
were he meal d with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so he s just
knocking within now are they come
exit provost this is a gentle provost seldom when the steeled gaoler is the friend of men
knocking within how now what noise
that spirit s possess d with haste that wounds th unsisting postern with these strokes
there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in he is call d up
have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die to morrow
as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning
happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we
besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear profess d the contrary
enter a messenger this is his lordship s man
and here comes claudio s pardon
my lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance
good morrow for as i take it it is almost day
aside this is his pardon purchas d by such sin for which the pardoner himself is in hence hath offence his quick celerity when it is borne in high authority
when vice makes mercy mercy s so extended that for the fault s love is th offender friended
i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely for he hath not us d it before
reads whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon barnardine
for my better satisfaction let me have claudio s head sent me by five
let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver
thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril
what say you to this sir
what is that barnardine who is to be executed in th afternoon
a bohemian born but here nurs d up and bred
one that is a prisoner nine years old
how came it that the absent duke had not either deliver d him to his liberty or executed him
i have heard it was ever his manner to do so
his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubted proof
most manifest and not denied by himself
hath he borne himself penitently in prison
how seems he to be touch d
a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what s past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal
he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk
we have very oft awak d him as if to carry him to execution and show d him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy
if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard
claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenc d him
to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy
how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo
i may make my case as claudio s to cross this in the smallest
by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide
let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to angelo
angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
o death s a great disguiser and you may add to it
shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bar d before his death
you know the course is common
if anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life
pardon me good father it is against my oath
were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
to him and to his substitutes
you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing
but what likelihood is in that
not a resemblance but a certainty
yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you
look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke
you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you
the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon over read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here
this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the duke s death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ
look th unfolding star calls up the shepherd
put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known
call your executioner and off with barnardine s head
i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place
yet you are amaz d but this shall absolutely resolve you
come away it is almost clear dawn
i am as well acquainted here as i was in our house of profession one would think it were mistress overdone s own house for here be many of her old customers
first here s young master rash he s in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger nine score and seventeen pounds of which he made five marks ready money
marry then ginger was not much in request for the old women were all dead
then is there here one master caper at the suit of master threepile the mercer for some four suits of peach colour d satin which now peaches him a beggar
then have we here young dizy and young master deepvow and master copperspur and master starvelackey the rapier and dagger man and young dropheir that kill d lusty pudding and master forthlight the tilter and brave master shootie the great traveller and wild halfcan that stabb d pots and i think forty more all great doers in our trade and are now for the lord s sake
you must rise and be hang d master barnardine
within a pox o your throats
you must be so good sir to rise and be put to death
within away you rogue away i am sleepy
tell him he must awake and that quickly too
pray master barnardine awake till you are executed and sleep afterwards
go in to him and fetch him out
he is coming sir he is coming i hear his straw rustle
is the axe upon the block sirrah
how now abhorson what s the news with you
truly sir i would desire you to clap into your prayers for look you the warrant s come
you rogue i have been drinking all night i am not fitted for t
for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day
enter duke disguised as before abhorson
look you sir here comes your ghostly father
do we jest now think you
sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart i am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you
friar not i i have been drinking hard all night and i will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my brains with billets
i will not consent to die this day that s certain
o sir you must and therefore i beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go
i swear i will not die to day for any man s persuasion
not a word if you have anything to say to me come to my ward for thence will not i to day
after him fellows bring him to the block
exeunt abhorson and pompey enter provost provost
now sir how do you find the prisoner
a creature unprepar d unmeet for death and to transport him in the mind he is were damnable
here in the prison father there died this morning of a cruel fever one ragozine a most notorious pirate a man of claudio s years his beard and head just of his colour
what if we do omit this reprobate till he were well inclin d and satisfy the deputy with the visage of ragozine more like to claudio
o tis an accident that heaven provides
dispatch it presently the hour draws on prefix d by angelo
see this be done and sent according to command whiles i persuade this rude wretch willingly to die
this shall be done good father presently
but barnardine must die this afternoon and how shall we continue claudio to save me from the danger that might come if he were known alive
let this be done put them in secret holds both barnardine and claudio
ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting to the under generation you shall find your safety manifested
quick dispatch and send the head to angelo
exit provost now will i write letters to angelo the provost he shall bear them whose contents shall witness to him i am near at home and that by great injunctions i am bound to enter publicly
him i ll desire to meet me at the consecrated fount a league below the city and from thence by cold gradation and well balanc d form
here is the head i ll carry it myself
make a swift return for i would commune with you of such things that want no ear but yours
she s come to know if yet her brother s pardon be come hither but i will keep her ignorant of her good to make her heavenly comforts of despair when it is least expected
good morning to you fair and gracious daughter
the better given me by so holy a man
hath yet the deputy sent my brother s pardon
he hath releas d him isabel from the world
his head is off and sent to angelo
nay but it is not so
show your wisdom daughter in your close patience isabella
o i will to him and pluck out his eyes
you shall not be admitted to his sight
this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven
mark what i say which you shall find by every syllable a faithful verity
the duke comes home to morrow
one of our covent and his confessor gives me this instance
already he hath carried notice to escalus and angelo who do prepare to meet him at the gates there to give up their pow r
if you can pace your wisdom in that good path that i would wish it go and you shall have your bosom on this wretch grace of the duke revenges to your heart and general honour
this letter then to friar peter give tis that he sent me of the duke s return
say by this token i desire his company at mariana s house to night
her cause and yours i ll perfect him withal and he shall bring you before the duke and to the head of angelo accuse him home and home
for my poor self i am combined by a sacred vow and shall be absent
command these fretting waters from your eyes with a light heart trust not my holy order if i pervert your course
o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red
i am fain to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to t
but they say the duke will be here to morrow
by my troth isabel i lov d thy brother
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived
sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in them
friar thou knowest not the duke so well as i do he s a better woodman than thou tak st him for
well you ll answer this one day
nay tarry i ll go along with thee i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke
you have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough
i was once before him for getting a wench with child
yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar
sir your company is fairer than honest
by my troth i ll go with thee to the lane s end
if bawdy talk offend you we ll have very little of it
nay friar i am a kind of burr i shall stick
angelo s house enter angelo and escalus escalus
every letter he hath writ hath disvouch d other
in most uneven and distracted manner
his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted
and why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there
and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his ent ring that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street
he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against us
well i beseech you let it be proclaim d betimes i th morn i ll call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him
i shall sir fare you well
exit escalus this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings
and by an eminent body that enforc d the law against it
but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me
yet reason dares her no for my authority bears a so credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather
he should have liv d save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have ta en revenge by so receiving a dishonour d life with ransom of such shame
would yet he had liv d
alack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right we would and we would not
exit scene v fields without the town enter duke in his own habit and friar peter duke
these letters at fit time deliver me
giving letters the provost knows our purpose and our plot
the matter being afoot keep your instruction and hold you ever to our special drift though sometimes you do blench from this to that as cause doth minister
go call at flavius house and tell him where i stay give the like notice to valentinus rowland and to crassus and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate but send me flavius first
i thank thee varrius thou hast made good haste
there s other of our friends will greet us here anon
a street near the city gate enter isabella and mariana isabella
to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part
yet i am advis d to do it he says to veil full purpose
besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for tis a physic that s bitter to sweet end
i would friar peter enter friar peter isabella
come i have found you out a stand most fit where you may have such vantage on the duke he shall not pass you
twice have the trumpets sounded the generous and gravest citizens have hent the gates and very near upon the duke is ent ring therefore hence away
the city gate enter at several doors duke varrius lords angelo escalus lucio provost officers and citizens duke
my very worthy cousin fairly met
our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
happy return be to your royal grace
many and hearty thankings to you both
we have made inquiry of you and we hear such goodness of your justice that our soul cannot but yield you forth to public thanks forerunning more requital
you make my bonds still greater
o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it to lock it in the wards of covert bosom when it deserves with characters of brass a forted residence gainst the tooth of time and razure of oblivion
and let the subject see to make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within
come escalus you must walk by us on our other hand and good supporters are you
enter friar peter and isabella peter
now is your time speak loud and kneel before him
vail your regard upon a wrong d i would fain have said a maid
o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice
here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him
o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil
hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believ d or wring redress from you
hear me o hear me here
my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice isabella
and she will speak most bitterly and strange
most strange but yet most truly will i speak
that angelo s forsworn is it not strange
that angelo s a murderer is t not strange
that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virgin violator is it not strange and strange
nay it is ten times strange
it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to th end of reck ning
poor soul she speaks this in th infirmity of sense
i conjure thee as thou believ st there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touch d with madness
make not impossible that which but seems unlike tis not impossible but one the wicked st caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an arch villain
believe it royal prince if he be less he s nothing but he s more had i more name for badness
by mine honesty if she be mad as i believe no other her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as e er i heard in madness
o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true
many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason
i am the sister of one claudio condemn d upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemn d by angelo
i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger lucio
that s i an t like your grace
i came to her from claudio and desir d her to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo for her poor brother s pardon
you were not bid to speak
no my good lord nor wish d to hold my peace
i wish you now then pray you take note of it and when you have a business for yourself pray heaven you then be perfect
the warrant s for yourself take heed to t
this gentleman told somewhat of my tale
it may be right but you are i the wrong to speak before your time
i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy
pardon it the phrase is to the matter
in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i pray d and kneel d how he refell d me and how i replied for this was of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him
but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother s head
o that it were as like as it is true
by heaven fond wretch thou know st not what thou speak st or else thou art suborn d against his honour in hateful practice
first his integrity stands without blemish next it imports no reason that with such vehemency he should pursue faults proper to himself
if he had so offended he would have weigh d thy brother by himself and not have cut him off
some one hath set you on confess the truth and say by whose advice thou cam st here to complain
then o you blessed ministers above keep me in patience and with ripened time unfold the evil which is here wrapt up in countenance
heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wrong d hence unbelieved go
i know you d fain be gone
shall we thus permit a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall on him so near us
this needs must be a practice
who knew of your intent and coming hither
one that i would were here friar lodowick
my lord i know him tis a meddling friar
i do not like the man had he been lay my lord for certain words he spake against your grace in your retirement i had swing d him soundly
this s a good friar belike
and to set on this wretched woman here against our substitute
but yesternight my lord she and that friar i saw them at the prison a saucy friar a very scurvy fellow
i have stood by my lord and i have heard your royal ear abus d
first hath this woman most wrongfully accus d your substitute who is as free from touch or soil with her as she from one ungot
know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
i know him for a man divine and holy not scurvy nor a temporary meddler as he s reported by this gentleman and on my trust a man that never yet did as he vouches misreport your grace
my lord most villainously believe it
well he in time may come to clear himself but at this instant he is sick my lord of a strange fever
upon his mere request being come to knowledge that there was complaint intended gainst lord angelo came i hither to speak as from his mouth what he doth know is true and false and what he with his oath and all probation will make up full clear whensoever he s convented
first for this woman to justify this worthy nobleman so vulgarly and personally accus d her shall you hear disproved to her eyes till she herself confess it
good friar let s hear it
exit isabella guarded do you not smile at this lord angelo
o heaven the vanity of wretched fools
come cousin angelo in this i ll be impartial be you judge of your own cause
enter mariana veiled is this the witness friar
first let her show her face and after speak
pardon my lord i will not show my face until my husband bid me
why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
my lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid widow nor wife
i would he had some cause to prattle for himself
my lord i do confess i ne er was married and i confess besides i am no maid
i have known my husband yet my husband knows not that ever he knew me
he was drunk then my lord it can be no better
for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
this is no witness for lord angelo
now i come to t my lord she that accuses him of fornication in self same manner doth accuse my husband and charges him my lord with such a time when i ll depose i had him in mine arms with all th effect of love
why just my lord and that is angelo who thinks he knows that he ne er knew my body but knows he thinks that he knows isabel s
my husband bids me now i will unmask
unveiling this is that face thou cruel angelo which once thou swor st was worth the looking on this is the hand which with a vow d contract was fast belock d in thine this is the body that took away the match from isabel and did supply thee at thy garden house in her imagin d person
my lord i must confess i know this woman and five years since there was some speech of marriage betwixt myself and her which was broke off partly for that her promised proportions came short of composition but in chief for that her reputation was disvalued in levity
since which time of five years i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her upon my faith and honour
noble prince as there comes light from heaven and words from breath as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue i am affianc d this man s wife as strongly as words could make up vows
and my good lord but tuesday night last gone in s garden house he knew me as a wife
as this is true let me in safety raise me from my knees or else for ever be confixed here a marble monument
i did but smile till now
now good my lord give me the scope of justice my patience here is touch d
i do perceive these poor informal women are no more but instruments of some more mightier member that sets them on
let me have way my lord to find this practice out
ay with my heart and punish them to your height of pleasure
thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman compact with her that s gone think st thou thy oaths though they would swear down each particular saint were testimonies against his worth and credit that s seal d in approbation
you lord escalus sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains to find out this abuse whence tis deriv d
there is another friar that set them on let him be sent for
would lie were here my lord
for he indeed hath set the women on to this complaint
your provost knows the place where he abides and he may fetch him
exit provost and you my noble and well warranted cousin whom it concerns to hear this matter forth do with your injuries as seems you best in any chastisement
i for a while will leave you but stir not you till you have well determin d upon these slanderers
my lord we ll do it throughly
exit duke signior lucio did not you say you knew that friar lodowick to be a dishonest person
cucullus non facit monachum honest in nothing but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the duke
we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him
we shall find this friar a notable fellow
as any in vienna on my word
call that same isabel here once again i would speak with her
exit an attendant pray you my lord give me leave to question you shall see how i ll handle her
not better than he by her own report
marry sir i think if you handled her privately she would sooner confess perchance publicly she ll be asham d
re enter officers with isabella and provost with the duke in his friar s habit escalus
i will go darkly to work with her
that s the way for women are light at midnight
come on mistress here s a gentlewoman denies all that you have said
my lord here comes the rascal i spoke of here with the provost
speak not you to him till we call upon you
come sir did you set these women on to slander lord angelo
they have confess d you did
and let the devil be sometime honour d for his burning throne
tis he should hear me speak
the duke s in us and we will hear you speak look you speak justly
but o poor souls come you to seek the lamb here of the fox good night to your redress
then is your cause gone too
the duke s unjust thus to retort your manifest appeal and put your trial in the villain s mouth which here you come to accuse
this is the rascal this is he i spoke of
why thou unreverend and unhallowed friar is t not enough thou hast suborn d these women to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth and in the witness of his proper ear to call him villain and then to glance from him to th duke himself to tax him with injustice
take him hence to th rack with him
we ll touze you joint by joint but we will know his purpose
be not so hot the duke dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he dare rack his own his subject am i not nor here provincial
my business in this state made me a looker on here in vienna where i have seen corruption boil and bubble till it o errun the stew laws for all faults but faults so countenanc d that the strong statutes stand like the forfeits in a barber s shop as much in mock as mark
what can you vouch against him signior lucio
is this the man that you did tell us of
come hither good man bald pate
i remember you sir by the sound of your voice
i met you at the prison in the absence of the duke
and do you remember what you said of the duke
and was the duke a fleshmonger a fool and a coward as you then reported him to be
you must sir change persons with me ere you make that my report you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse
did not i pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches
i protest i love the duke as i love myself
hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses
such a fellow is not to be talk d withal
lay bolts enough upon him let him speak no more
away with those giglets too and with the other confederate companion
the provost lays bands on the duke duke
come sir come sir come sir foh sir
why you bald pated lying rascal you must be hooded must you
show your knave s visage with a pox to you
show your sheep biting face and be hang d an hour
pulls off the friar s bood and discovers the duke duke
thou art the first knave that e er mad st a duke
first provost let me bail these gentle three
to lucio sneak not away sir for the friar and you must have a word anon
this may prove worse than hanging
to escalus what you have spoke i pardon sit you down
we ll borrow place of him
to angelo sir by your leave
hast thou or word or wit or impudence that yet can do thee office
if thou hast rely upon it till my tale be heard and hold no longer out
o my dread lord i should be guiltier than my guiltiness to think i can be undiscernible when i perceive your grace like pow r divine hath look d upon my passes
then good prince no longer session hold upon my shame but let my trial be mine own confession immediate sentence then and sequent death is all the grace i beg
say wast thou e er contracted to this woman
go take her hence and marry her instantly
do you the office friar which consummate return him here again
exeunt angelo mariana friar peter and provost escalus
my lord i am more amaz d at his dishonour than at the strangeness of it
your friar is now your prince
as i was then advertising and holy to your business not changing heart with habit i am still attorney d at your service
o give me pardon that i your vassal have employ d and pain d your unknown sovereignty
and now dear maid be you as free to us
your brother s death i know sits at your heart and you may marvel why i obscur d myself labouring to save his life and would not rather make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow r than let him so be lost
o most kind maid it was the swift celerity of his death which i did think with slower foot came on that brain d my purpose
that life is better life past fearing death than that which lives to fear
make it your comfort so happy is your brother
re enter angelo mariana friar peter and provost duke
for this new married man approaching here whose salt imagination yet hath wrong d your well defended honour you must pardon for mariana s sake but as he adjudg d your brother being criminal in double violation of sacred chastity and of promise breach thereon dependent for your brother s life the very mercy of the law cries out most audible even from his proper tongue an angelo for claudio death for death
haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like doth quit like and measure still for measure
then angelo thy fault s thus manifested which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
we do condemn thee to the very block where claudio stoop d to death and with like haste
o my most gracious lord i hope you will not mock me with a husband
it is your husband mock d you with a husband
consenting to the safeguard of your honour i thought your marriage fit else imputation for that he knew you might reproach your life and choke your good to come
for his possessions although by confiscation they are ours we do instate and widow you withal to buy you a better husband
o my dear lord i crave no other nor no better man
never crave him we are definitive
you do but lose your labour
to lucio now sir to you
sweet isabel take my part lend me your knees and all my life to come i ll lend you all my life to do you service
against all sense you do importune her
should she kneel down in mercy of this fact her brother s ghost his paved bed would break and take her hence in horror
isabel sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me hold up your hands say nothing i ll speak all
they say best men moulded out of faults and for the most become much more the better for being a little bad so may my husband
o isabel will you not lend a knee
he dies for claudio s death
kneeling most bounteous sir look if it please you on this man condemn d as if my brother liv d
i partly think a due sincerity govern d his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die
my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not o ertake his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perish d by the way
thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts
your suit s unprofitable stand up i say
i have bethought me of another fault
provost how came it claudio was beheaded at an unusual hour
had you a special warrant for the deed
no my good lord it was by private message
for which i do discharge you of your office give up your keys
pardon me noble lord i thought it was a fault but knew it not yet did repent me after more advice for testimony whereof one in the prison that should by private order else have died i have reserv d alive
i would thou hadst done so by claudio
go fetch him hither let me look upon him
i am sorry one so learned and so wise as you lord angelo have still appear d should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood and lack of temper d judgment afterward
i am sorry that such sorrow i procure and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart that i crave death more willingly than mercy tis my deserving and i do entreat it
re enter provost with barnardine claudio muffled and juliet duke
there was a friar told me of this man
sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul that apprehends no further than this world and squar st thy life according
thou rt condemn d but for those earthly faults i quit them all and pray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to come
friar advise him i leave him to your hand
what muffl d fellow s that
this is another prisoner that i sav d who should have died when claudio lost his head as like almost to claudio as himself
to isabella if he be like your brother for his sake is he pardon d and for your lovely sake give me your hand and say you will be mine he is my brother too
by this lord angelo perceives he s safe methinks i see a quick ning in his eye
well angelo your evil quits you well
look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
i find an apt remission in myself and yet here s one in place i cannot pardon
to lucio you sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward one all of luxury an ass a madman
wherein have i so deserv d of you that you extol me thus
faith my lord i spoke it but according to the trick
if you will hang me for it you may but i had rather it would please you i might be whipt
whipt first sir and hang d after
proclaim it provost round about the city if any woman wrong d by this lewd fellow as i have heard him swear himself there s one whom he begot with child let her appear and he shall marry her
the nuptial finish d let him be whipt and hang d
i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore
your highness said even now i made you a duke good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
thy slanders i forgive and therewithal remit thy other forfeits
take him to prison and see our pleasure herein executed
marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and hanging
exeunt officers with lucio she claudio that you wrong d look you restore
love her angelo i have confess d her and i know her virtue
thanks good friend escalus for thy much goodness there s more behind that is more gratulate
thanks provost for thy care and secrecy we shall employ thee in a worthier place
forgive him angelo that brought you home the head of ragozine for claudio s th offence pardons itself
dear isabel i have a motion much imports your good whereto if you ll a willing ear incline what s mine is yours and what is yours is mine
so bring us to our palace where we ll show what s yet behind that s meet you all should know
exeunt the merchant of venice contents act i scene i venice
in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me
you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff ’tis made of whereof it is born i am to learn
and such a want wit sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself
your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings
believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad
i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad
my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea
i should not see the sandy hour glass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dock’d in sand vailing her high top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial
should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessel’s side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing
shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad
but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise
i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
why then you are in love
then let us say you are sad because you are not merry and ’twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad
now by two headed janus nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper
and other of such vinegar aspect that they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable
here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman gratiano and lorenzo
we leave you now with better company
i would have stay’d till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me
your worth is very dear in my regard
i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace th’ occasion to depart
good signiors both when shall we laugh
we’ll make our leisures to attend on yours
my lord bassanio since you have found antonio we two will leave you but at dinner time i pray you have in mind where we must meet
you look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world
they lose it that do buy it with much care
believe me you are marvellously chang’d
i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one
let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans
why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
and creep into the jaundice by being peevish
i’ll tell thee more of this another time
but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion
i’ll end my exhortation after dinner
well we will leave you then till dinner time
i must be one of these same dumb wise men for gratiano never lets me speak
well keep me company but two years moe thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
i’ll grow a talker for this gear
thanks i’ faith for silence is only commendable in a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible
gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice
his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search
well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promis’d to tell me of
’tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance
nor do i now make moan to be abridg’d from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gag’d
to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe
i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assur’d my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlock’d to your occasions
in my school days when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the self same flight the self same way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both
i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence
i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost
but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first
you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have
then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it
in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues
sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalu’d to cato’s daughter brutus’ portia
nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos’ strond and many jasons come in quest of her
o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate
thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rack’d even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia
go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake
enter portia with her waiting woman nerissa
by my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world
you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are
and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing
it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean
superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer
they would be better if well followed
if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching
the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband
i may neither choose who i would nor refuse who i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father
is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none
your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations
therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love
but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come
i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection
first there is the neapolitan prince
ay that’s a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself
i am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith
then is there the county palatine
he doth nothing but frown as who should say “and you will not have me choose ” he hears merry tales and smiles not
i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth
i had rather be married to a death’s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these
god defend me from these two
how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon
god made him and therefore let him pass for a man
in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he
why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan’s a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine
he is every man in no man
if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap’ring
he will fence with his own shadow
if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands
if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him
what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england
you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english
he is a proper man’s picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show
i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behaviour everywhere
what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour
that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able
i think the frenchman became his surety and seal’d under for another
how like you the young german the duke of saxony’s nephew
very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast
and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him
if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father’s will if you should refuse to accept him
therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it
i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge
you need not fear lady the having any of these lords
they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets
if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father’s will
i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence
and i pray god grant them a fair departure
do you not remember lady in your father’s time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat
yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he call’d
he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon was the best deserving a fair lady
i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise
the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave
and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight
if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach
if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me
whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door
enter bassanio with shylock the jew
for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound
three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound
have you heard any imputation to the contrary
ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient
yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies
i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad
but ships are but boards sailors but men there be land rats and water rats water thieves and land thieves—i mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks
i think i may take his bond
i will be assured i may
and that i may be assured i will bethink me
if it please you to dine with us
yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the nazarite conjured the devil into
i will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but i will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you
aside how like a fawning publican he looks
i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice
if i can catch him once upon the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him
he hates our sacred nation and he rails even there where merchants most do congregate on me my bargains and my well won thrift which he calls interest
cursed be my tribe if i forgive him
i am debating of my present store and by the near guess of my memory i cannot instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats
tubal a wealthy hebrew of my tribe will furnish me
how many months do you desire
to antonio rest you fair good signior your worship was the last man in our mouths
shylock albeit i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend i’ll break a custom
to bassanio is he yet possess’d how much ye would
i had forgot three months you told me so
and let me see but hear you methought you said you neither lend nor borrow upon advantage
when jacob graz’d his uncle laban’s sheep — this jacob from our holy abram was as his wise mother wrought in his behalf the third possessor ay he was the third
no not take interest not as you would say directly interest mark what jacob did
when laban and himself were compromis’d that all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied should fall as jacob’s hire the ewes being rank in end of autumn turned to the rams and when the work of generation was between these woolly breeders in the act the skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands and in the doing of the deed of kind he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes who then conceiving did in eaning time fall parti colour’d lambs and those were jacob’s
this was a way to thrive and he was blest and thrift is blessing if men steal it not
this was a venture sir that jacob serv’d for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven
was this inserted to make interest good
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
i cannot tell i make it breed as fast
mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart
o what a goodly outside falsehood hath
three thousand ducats ’tis a good round sum
three months from twelve then let me see the rate
well shylock shall we be beholding to you
signior antonio many a time and oft in the rialto you have rated me about my moneys and my usances
still have i borne it with a patient shrug for suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe
you call me misbeliever cut throat dog and spet upon my jewish gaberdine and all for use of that which is mine own
well then it now appears you need my help
go to then you come to me and you say “shylock we would have moneys ” you say so you that did void your rheum upon my beard and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold moneys is your suit
what should i say to you
should i not say “hath a dog money
is it possible a cur can lend three thousand ducats ” or shall i bend low and in a bondman’s key with bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness say this “fair sir you spet on me on wednesday last you spurn’d me such a day another time you call’d me dog and for these courtesies i’ll lend you thus much moneys”
i am as like to call thee so again to spet on thee again to spurn thee too
if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend
but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face exact the penalty
why look you how you storm
i would be friends with you and have your love forget the shames that you have stain’d me with supply your present wants and take no doit of usance for my moneys and you’ll not hear me this is kind i offer
go with me to a notary seal me there your single bond and in a merry sport if you repay me not on such a day in such a place such sum or sums as are express’d in the condition let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me
content in faith i’ll seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew
you shall not seal to such a bond for me i’ll rather dwell in my necessity
why fear not man i will not forfeit it within these two months that’s a month before this bond expires i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond
o father abram what these christians are whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect the thoughts of others
pray you tell me this if he should break his day what should i gain by the exaction of the forfeiture
a pound of man’s flesh taken from a man is not so estimable profitable neither as flesh of muttons beefs or goats
i say to buy his favour i extend this friendship
if he will take it so
if not adieu and for my love i pray you wrong me not
yes shylock i will seal unto this bond
then meet me forthwith at the notary’s give him direction for this merry bond and i will go and purse the ducats straight see to my house left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave and presently i’ll be with you
exit shylock this hebrew will turn christian he grows kind
i like not fair terms and a villain’s mind
come on in this there can be no dismay my ships come home a month before the day
exeunt act ii scene i belmont
enter the prince of morocco a tawny moor all in white and three or four followers accordingly with portia nerissa and their train
mislike me not for my complexion the shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun to whom i am a neighbour and near bred
bring me the fairest creature northward born where phœbus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles and let us make incision for your love to prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
i tell thee lady this aspect of mine hath fear’d the valiant by my love i swear the best regarded virgins of our clime have lov’d it too
i would not change this hue except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden’s eyes besides the lott’ry of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing
but if my father had not scanted me and hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renowned prince then stood as fair as any comer i have look’d on yet for my affection
even for that i thank you
therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets to try my fortune
by this scimitar that slew the sophy and a persian prince that won three fields of sultan solyman i would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look outbrave the heart most daring on the earth pluck the young sucking cubs from the she bear yea mock the lion when he roars for prey to win thee lady
if hercules and lichas play at dice which is the better man the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand so is alcides beaten by his rage and so may i blind fortune leading me miss that which one unworthier may attain and die with grieving
you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage
come bring me unto my chance
after dinner your hazard shall be made
good fortune then to make me blest or cursed’st among men
enter launcelet gobbo the clown alone
certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this jew my master
the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me “gobbo launcelet gobbo good launcelet” or “good gobbo ” or “good launcelet gobbo use your legs take the start run away ” my conscience says “no take heed honest launcelet take heed honest gobbo” or as aforesaid “honest launcelet gobbo do not run scorn running with thy heels ” well the most courageous fiend bids me pack
“fia ” says the fiend “away ” says the fiend
“for the heavens rouse up a brave mind ” says the fiend “and run ” well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me “my honest friend launcelet being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son for indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a kind of taste —well my conscience says “launcelet budge not ” “budge ” says the fiend
“budge not ” says my conscience
“conscience ” say i “you counsel well ” “fiend ” say i “you counsel well ” to be ruled by my conscience i should stay with the jew my master who god bless the mark is a kind of devil and to run away from the jew i should be ruled by the fiend who saving your reverence is the devil himself
certainly the jew is the very devil incarnation and in my conscience my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the jew
the fiend gives the more friendly counsel
i will run fiend my heels are at your commandment i will run
enter old gobbo with a basket
master young man you i pray you which is the way to master jew’s
aside o heavens this is my true begotten father who being more than sand blind high gravel blind knows me not
i will try confusions with him
master young gentleman i pray you which is the way to master jew’s
turn up on your right hand at the next turning but at the next turning of all on your left marry at the very next turning turn of no hand but turn down indirectly to the jew’s house
be god’s sonties ’twill be a hard way to hit
can you tell me whether one launcelet that dwells with him dwell with him or no
talk you of young master launcelet
aside mark me now now will i raise the waters
talk you of young master launcelet
no master sir but a poor man’s son his father though i say’t is an honest exceeding poor man and god be thanked well to live
well let his father be what he will we talk of young master launcelet
your worship’s friend and launcelet sir
but i pray you ergo old man ergo i beseech you talk you of young master launcelet
of launcelet an’t please your mastership
talk not of master launcelet father for the young gentleman according to fates and destinies and such odd sayings the sisters three and such branches of learning is indeed deceased or as you would say in plain terms gone to heaven
the boy was the very staff of my age my very prop
aside do i look like a cudgel or a hovel post a staff or a prop
i know you not young gentleman but i pray you tell me is my boy god rest his soul alive or dead
do you not know me father
alack sir i am sand blind i know you not
nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me it is a wise father that knows his own child
well old man i will tell you news of your son
give me your blessing truth will come to light murder cannot be hid long a man’s son may but in the end truth will out
pray you sir stand up i am sure you are not launcelet my boy
pray you let’s have no more fooling about it but give me your blessing
i am launcelet your boy that was your son that is your child that shall be
i cannot think you are my son
i know not what i shall think of that but i am launcelet the jew’s man and i am sure margery your wife is my mother
i’ll be sworn if thou be launcelet thou art mine own flesh and blood
lord worshipped might he be what a beard hast thou got
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than dobbin my fill horse has on his tail
it should seem then that dobbin’s tail grows backward
i am sure he had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i last saw him
how dost thou and thy master agree
i have brought him a present
but for mine own part as i have set up my rest to run away so i will not rest till i have run some ground
i am famished in his service
you may tell every finger i have with my ribs
father i am glad you are come give me your present to one master bassanio who indeed gives rare new liveries
if i serve not him i will run as far as god has any ground
o rare fortune here comes the man
to him father for i am a jew if i serve the jew any longer
enter bassanio with leonardo and a follower or two
you may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock
see these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire gratiano to come anon to my lodging
gramercy wouldst thou aught with me
here’s my son sir a poor boy
not a poor boy sir but the rich jew’s man that would sir as my father shall specify
he hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve
indeed the short and the long is i serve the jew and have a desire as my father shall specify
his master and he saving your worship’s reverence are scarce cater cousins
to be brief the very truth is that the jew having done me wrong doth cause me as my father being i hope an old man shall frutify unto you
i have here a dish of doves that i would bestow upon your worship and my suit is— launcelet
in very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as your worship shall know by this honest old man and though i say it though old man yet poor man my father
that is the very defect of the matter sir
i know thee well thou hast obtain’d thy suit
shylock thy master spoke with me this day and hath preferr’d thee if it be preferment to leave a rich jew’s service to become the follower of so poor a gentleman
the old proverb is very well parted between my master shylock and you sir you have “the grace of god” sir and he hath “enough”
take leave of thy old master and inquire my lodging out
to a servant give him a livery more guarded than his fellows’ see it done
i cannot get a service no
i have ne’er a tongue in my head
looking on his palm well if any man in italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book i shall have good fortune go to here’s a simple line of life
here’s a small trifle of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming in for one man
and then to scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather bed here are simple ’scapes
well if fortune be a woman she’s a good wench for this gear
father come i’ll take my leave of the jew in the twinkling
exeunt launcelet and old gobbo bassanio
i pray thee good leonardo think on this
these things being bought and orderly bestow’d return in haste for i do feast tonight my best esteem’d acquaintance hie thee go
my best endeavours shall be done herein
you must not deny me i must go with you to belmont
but hear thee gratiano thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice parts that become thee happily enough and in such eyes as ours appear not faults but where thou art not known why there they show something too liberal
pray thee take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behaviour i be misconst’red in the place i go to and lose my hopes
if i do not put on a sober habit talk with respect and swear but now and then wear prayer books in my pocket look demurely nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes thus with my hat and sigh and say “amen” use all the observance of civility like one well studied in a sad ostent to please his grandam never trust me more
well we shall see your bearing
nay but i bar tonight you shall not gauge me by what we do tonight
i would entreat you rather to put on your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends that purpose merriment
but fare you well i have some business
and i must to lorenzo and the rest but we will visit you at supper time
i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so
our house is hell and thou a merry devil didst rob it of some taste of tediousness
but fare thee well there is a ducat for thee and launcelet soon at supper shalt thou see lorenzo who is thy new master’s guest
give him this letter do it secretly
i would not have my father see me in talk with thee
tears exhibit my tongue most beautiful pagan most sweet jew
if a christian do not play the knave and get thee i am much deceived
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit
exit launcelet alack what heinous sin is it in me to be ashamed to be my father’s child
but though i am a daughter to his blood i am not to his manners
o lorenzo if thou keep promise i shall end this strife become a christian and thy loving wife
enter gratiano lorenzo salarino and solanio
nay we will slink away in supper time disguise us at my lodging and return all in an hour
we have not made good preparation
we have not spoke us yet of torch bearers
’tis vile unless it may be quaintly order’d and better in my mind not undertook
’tis now but four o’clock we have two hours to furnish us
and it shall please you to break up this it shall seem to signify
i know the hand in faith ’tis a fair hand and whiter than the paper it writ on is the fair hand that writ
marry sir to bid my old master the jew to sup tonight with my new master the christian
tell gentle jessica i will not fail her speak it privately
go gentlemen exit launcelet will you prepare you for this masque tonight
i am provided of a torch bearer
ay marry i’ll be gone about it straight
meet me and gratiano at gratiano’s lodging some hour hence
was not that letter from fair jessica
i must needs tell thee all
she hath directed how i shall take her from her father’s house what gold and jewels she is furnish’d with what page’s suit she hath in readiness
if e’er the jew her father come to heaven it will be for his gentle daughter’s sake and never dare misfortune cross her foot unless she do it under this excuse that she is issue to a faithless jew
come go with me peruse this as thou goest fair jessica shall be my torch bearer
enter shylock the jew and launcelet his man that was the clown
well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge the difference of old shylock and bassanio — what jessica —thou shalt not gormandize as thou hast done with me —what jessica — and sleep and snore and rend apparel out
i do not bid thee call
your worship was wont to tell me i could do nothing without bidding
i am bid forth to supper jessica
i am not bid for love they flatter me
but yet i’ll go in hate to feed upon the prodigal christian
jessica my girl look to my house
i am right loath to go there is some ill a brewing towards my rest for i did dream of money bags tonight
my young master doth expect your reproach
i will not say you shall see a masque but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on black monday last at six o’clock i’ th’ morning falling out that year on ash wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon
hear you me jessica lock up my doors and when you hear the drum and the vile squealing of the wry neck’d fife clamber not you up to the casements then nor thrust your head into the public street to gaze on christian fools with varnish’d faces but stop my house’s ears i mean my casements
let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter my sober house
by jacob’s staff i swear i have no mind of feasting forth tonight
mistress look out at window for all this
there will come a christian by will be worth a jewess’ eye
what says that fool of hagar’s offspring ha
his words were “farewell mistress ” nothing else
the patch is kind enough but a huge feeder snail slow in profit and he sleeps by day more than the wild cat
drones hive not with me therefore i part with him and part with him to one that i would have him help to waste his borrowed purse
perhaps i will return immediately do as i bid you shut doors after you “fast bind fast find ” a proverb never stale in thrifty mind
farewell and if my fortune be not crost i have a father you a daughter lost
enter the masquers gratiano and salarino
this is the penthouse under which lorenzo desired us to make stand
and it is marvel he out dwells his hour for lovers ever run before the clock
o ten times faster venus’ pigeons fly to seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited
that ever holds who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down
where is the horse that doth untread again his tedious measures with the unbated fire that he did pace them first
all things that are are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d
how like a younger or a prodigal the scarfed bark puts from her native bay hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind
how like the prodigal doth she return with over weather’d ribs and ragged sails lean rent and beggar’d by the strumpet wind
here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter
sweet friends your patience for my long abode
not i but my affairs have made you wait
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives i’ll watch as long for you then
enter jessica above in boy’s clothes
tell me for more certainty albeit i’ll swear that i do know your tongue
lorenzo certain and my love indeed for who love i so much
and now who knows but you lorenzo whether i am yours
heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
here catch this casket it is worth the pains
i am glad ’tis night you do not look on me for i am much asham’d of my exchange
but love is blind and lovers cannot see the pretty follies that themselves commit for if they could cupid himself would blush to see me thus transformed to a boy
descend for you must be my torch bearer
must i hold a candle to my shames
they in themselves good sooth are too too light
why ’tis an office of discovery love and i should be obscur’d
so are you sweet even in the lovely garnish of a boy
but come at once for the close night doth play the runaway and we are stay’d for at bassanio’s feast
i will make fast the doors and gild myself with some moe ducats and be with you straight
now by my hood a gentle and no jew
beshrew me but i love her heartily for she is wise if i can judge of her and fair she is if that mine eyes be true and true she is as she hath prov’d herself
and therefore like herself wise fair and true shall she be placed in my constant soul
our masquing mates by this time for us stay
exit with jessica and salarino enter antonio
’tis nine o’clock our friends all stay for you
no masque tonight the wind is come about bassanio presently will go aboard
i have sent twenty out to seek for you
i desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight
enter portia with the prince of morocco and both their trains
go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince
the first of gold who this inscription bears “who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ” the second silver which this promise carries “who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ” this third dull lead with warning all as blunt “who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath ” how shall i know if i do choose the right
the one of them contains my picture prince
if you choose that then i am yours withal
i will survey the inscriptions back again
“who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath ” must give for what
this casket threatens men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross i’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
what says the silver with her virgin hue
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ” as much as he deserves
pause there morocco and weigh thy value with an even hand
if thou be’st rated by thy estimation thou dost deserve enough and yet enough may not extend so far as to the lady
and yet to be afeard of my deserving were but a weak disabling of myself
why that’s the lady i do in birth deserve her and in fortunes in graces and in qualities of breeding but more than these in love i do deserve
what if i stray’d no farther but chose here
let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold “who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ” why that’s the lady all the world desires her
from the four corners of the earth they come to kiss this shrine this mortal breathing saint
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide arabia are as throughfares now for princes to come view fair portia
the watery kingdom whose ambitious head spets in the face of heaven is no bar to stop the foreign spirits but they come as o’er a brook to see fair portia
one of these three contains her heavenly picture
is’t like that lead contains her
’twere damnation to think so base a thought
it were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
or shall i think in silver she’s immur’d being ten times undervalued to tried gold
never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold
they have in england a coin that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold but that’s insculp’d upon but here an angel in a golden bed lies all within
here do i choose and thrive i as i may
there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours
he unlocks the golden casket prince of morocco
a carrion death within whose empty eye there is a written scroll
all that glisters is not gold often have you heard that told
many a man his life hath sold but my outside to behold
had you been as wise as bold young in limbs in judgment old your answer had not been inscroll’d fare you well your suit is cold cold indeed and labour lost then farewell heat and welcome frost
i have too griev’d a heart to take a tedious leave
let all of his complexion choose me so
why man i saw bassanio under sail with him is gratiano gone along and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not
the villain jew with outcries rais’d the duke who went with him to search bassanio’s ship
he came too late the ship was under sail but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica
besides antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship
i never heard a passion so confus’d so strange outrageous and so variable as the dog jew did utter in the streets
a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats of double ducats stol’n from me by my daughter
and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones stol’n by my daughter
find the girl she hath the stones upon her and the ducats ” salarino
why all the boys in venice follow him crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
let good antonio look he keep his day or he shall pay for this
i reason’d with a frenchman yesterday who told me in the narrow seas that part the french and english there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught
i thought upon antonio when he told me and wish’d in silence that it were not his
you were best to tell antonio what you hear yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
a kinder gentleman treads not the earth
i saw bassanio and antonio part bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return
he answered “do not so slubber not business for my sake bassanio but stay the very riping of the time and for the jew’s bond which he hath of me let it not enter in your mind of love be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there ” and even there his eye being big with tears turning his face he put his hand behind him and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanio’s hand and so they parted
i think he only loves the world for him
i pray thee let us go and find him out and quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other
quick quick i pray thee draw the curtain straight
the prince of arragon hath ta’en his oath and comes to his election presently
enter the prince of arragon his train and portia
behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contain’d straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d
but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately
i am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things first never to unfold to anyone which casket ’twas i chose next if i fail of the right casket never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage lastly if i do fail in fortune of my choice immediately to leave you and be gone
to these injunctions everyone doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self
and so have i address’d me
fortune now to my heart’s hope
“who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath ” you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard
let me see “who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ” what many men desire
that “many” may be meant by the fool multitude that choose by show not learning more than the fond eye doth teach which pries not to th’ interior but like the martlet builds in the weather on the outward wall even in the force and road of casualty
i will not choose what many men desire because i will not jump with common spirits and rank me with the barbarous multitudes
why then to thee thou silver treasure house tell me once more what title thou dost bear
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ” and well said too for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honourable without the stamp of merit
let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity
o that estates degrees and offices were not deriv’d corruptly and that clear honour were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer
how many then should cover that stand bare
how many be commanded that command
how much low peasantry would then be gleaned from the true seed of honour
and how much honour pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times to be new varnish’d
“who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ” i will assume desert
give me a key for this and instantly unlock my fortunes here
he opens the silver casket portia
too long a pause for that which you find there
the portrait of a blinking idiot presenting me a schedule
how much unlike art thou to portia
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings
“who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves ” did i deserve no more than a fool’s head
to offend and judge are distinct offices and of opposed natures
the fire seven times tried this seven times tried that judgment is that did never choose amiss
some there be that shadows kiss such have but a shadow’s bliss
there be fools alive i wis silver’d o’er and so was this
take what wife you will to bed i will ever be your head so be gone you are sped still more fool i shall appear by the time i linger here
with one fool’s head i came to woo but i go away with two
i’ll keep my oath patiently to bear my wroth
exit aragon with his train portia
thus hath the candle sing’d the moth
when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose
the ancient saying is no heresy hanging and wiving goes by destiny
madam there is alighted at your gate a young venetian one that comes before to signify th’ approaching of his lord from whom he bringeth sensible regreets to wit besides commends and courteous breath gifts of rich value yet i have not seen so likely an ambassador of love
a day in april never came so sweet to show how costly summer was at hand as this fore spurrer comes before his lord
i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spend’st such high day wit in praising him
come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupid’s post that comes so mannerly
bassanio lord love if thy will it be
exeunt act iii scene i venice
now what news on the rialto
why yet it lives there unchecked that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack’d on the narrow seas the goodwins i think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word
i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband
but it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good antonio the honest antonio —o that i had a title good enough to keep his name company — salarino
why the end is he hath lost a ship
i would it might prove the end of his losses
let me say “amen” betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew
how now shylock what news among the merchants
you knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter’s flight
that’s certain i for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal
and shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledged and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam
that’s certain if the devil may be her judge
my own flesh and blood to rebel
i say my daughter is my flesh and my blood
there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish
but tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no
there i have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the rialto a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart let him look to his bond
he was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond he was wont to lend money for a christian cur’sy let him look to his bond
why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh
to bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else it will feed my revenge
he hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million laugh’d at my losses mock’d at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies
hath not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions
fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a christian is
if you prick us do we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die
and if you wrong us shall we not revenge
if we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that
if a jew wrong a christian what is his humility
if a christian wrong a jew what should his sufferance be by christian example
the villainy you teach me i will execute and it shall go hard but i will better the instruction
gentlemen my master antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both
we have been up and down to seek him
here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be match’d unless the devil himself turn jew
exeunt solanio salarino and the servant shylock
how now tubal what news from genoa
i often came where i did hear of her but cannot find her
a diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in frankfort
the curse never fell upon our nation till now i never felt it till now
two thousand ducats in that and other precious precious jewels
i would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin
and i know not what’s spent in the search
the thief gone with so much and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my shoulders no sighs but o’ my breathing no tears but o’ my shedding
yes other men have ill luck too
antonio as i heard in genoa— shylock
—hath an argosy cast away coming from tripolis
is it true is it true
i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack
your daughter spent in genoa as i heard one night fourscore ducats
thou stick’st a dagger in me
i shall never see my gold again
there came divers of antonio’s creditors in my company to venice that swear he cannot choose but break
i am very glad of it
i’ll plague him i’ll torture him
one of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey
it was my turquoise i had it of leah when i was a bachelor
i would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys
nay that’s true that’s very true
go tubal fee me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before
i will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of venice i can make what merchandise i will
go tubal and meet me at our synagogue
go good tubal at our synagogue tubal
enter bassanio portia gratiano nerissa and all their trains
i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear a while
there’s something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality
but lest you should not understand me well — and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought — i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me
i could teach you how to choose right but then i am forsworn
but if you do you’ll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn
beshrew your eyes they have o’erlook’d me and divided me
one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours
o these naughty times puts bars between the owners and their rights
and so though yours not yours
prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but ’tis to peise the time to eche it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election
let me choose for as i am i live upon the rack
then confess what treason there is mingled with your love
none but that ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love
there may as well be amity and life ’tween snow and fire as treason and my love
ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything
promise me life and i’ll confess the truth
“confess and love” had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance
but let me to my fortune and the caskets
i am lock’d in one of them
if you do love me you will find me out
nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
let music sound while he doth make his choice
then if he lose he makes a swan like end fading in music
that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and wat’ry death bed for him
he may win and what is music then
then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a new crowned monarch
such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear and summon him to marriage
now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the sea monster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of th’ exploit
with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray
a song whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself
tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head
it is engend’red in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies
let us all ring fancy’s knell i’ll begin it —ding dong bell all
so may the outward shows be least themselves
the world is still deceiv’d with ornament
in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being season’d with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil
in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament
there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts
how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward search’d have livers white as milk and these assume but valour’s excrement to render them redoubted
look on beauty and you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre
thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest
therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge ’tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught thy palenness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence
aside how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rash embrac’d despair and shudd’ring fear and green ey’d jealousy
o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rain thy joy scant this excess
i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit
what demi god hath come so near creation
or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion
here are sever’d lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends
here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs
but her eyes — how could he see to do them
having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnish’d
yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance
here’s the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune
you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true
since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new
if you be well pleas’d with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn to where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll
fair lady by your leave kissing her
i come by note to give and to receive
like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether those peals of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirm’d sign’d ratified by you
you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtues beauties livings friends exceed account
but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlesson’d girl unschool’d unpractis’d happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king
myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted
but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen o’er myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours —my lord’s
i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you
madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy express’d and not express’d
but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence
o then be bold to say bassanio’s dead
my lord and lady it is now our time that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper to cry good joy
good joy my lord and lady
my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me
and when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too
with all my heart so thou canst get a wife
i thank your lordship you have got me one
my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours you saw the mistress i beheld the maid
you lov’d i lov’d for intermission no more pertains to me my lord than you
your fortune stood upon the caskets there and so did mine too as the matter falls
for wooing here until i sweat again and swearing till my very roof was dry with oaths of love at last if promise last i got a promise of this fair one here to have her love provided that your fortune achiev’d her mistress
madam it is so you stand pleas’d withal
and do you gratiano mean good faith
our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage
we’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
no we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down
what and my old venetian friend salerio
lorenzo and salerio welcome hither if that the youth of my new int’rest here have power to bid you welcome
by your leave i bid my very friends and countrymen sweet portia welcome
so do i my lord they are entirely welcome
for my part my lord my purpose was not to have seen you here but meeting with salerio by the way he did entreat me past all saying nay to come with him along
i did my lord and i have reason for it
signior antonio commends him to you
ere i ope his letter i pray you tell me how my good friend doth
not sick my lord unless it be in mind nor well unless in mind
his letter there will show you his estate
nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome
how doth that royal merchant good antonio
i know he will be glad of our success
we are the jasons we have won the fleece
i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
there are some shrewd contents in yond same paper that steals the colour from bassanio’s cheek
some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man
with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you
o sweet portia here are a few of the unpleasant’st words that ever blotted paper
gentle lady when i did first impart my love to you i freely told you all the wealth i had ran in my veins i was a gentleman
and then i told you true
and yet dear lady rating myself at nothing you shall see how much i was a braggart
when i told you my state was nothing i should then have told you that i was worse than nothing for indeed i have engag’d myself to a dear friend engag’d my friend to his mere enemy to feed my means
here is a letter lady the paper as the body of my friend and every word in it a gaping wound issuing life blood
from tripolis from mexico and england from lisbon barbary and india and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch of merchant marring rocks
besides it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew he would not take it
never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man
he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice
twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond
when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonio’s flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him
and i know my lord if law authority and power deny not it will go hard with poor antonio
is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
the dearest friend to me the kindest man the best condition’d and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears than any that draws breath in italy
what sum owes he the jew
pay him six thousand and deface the bond
double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio’s fault
first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend
for never shall you lie by portia’s side with an unquiet soul
you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over
when it is paid bring your true friend along
my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows
for you shall hence upon your wedding day
bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear
but let me hear the letter of your friend
sweet bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible i should live all debts are clear’d between you and i if i might but see you at my death
if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter portia
o love dispatch all business and be gone
since i have your good leave to go away i will make haste but till i come again no bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain
enter shylock salarino antonio and gaoler
this is the fool that lent out money gratis
i’ll have my bond speak not against my bond
i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond
thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause but since i am a dog beware my fangs the duke shall grant me justice
i do wonder thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond to come abroad with him at his request
i pray thee hear me speak
i will not hear thee speak
i’ll have my bond and therefore speak no more
i’ll not be made a soft and dull eyed fool to shake the head relent and sigh and yield to christian intercessors
follow not i’ll have no speaking i will have my bond
it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men
i’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers
he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft deliver’d from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me
i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold
the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied ’twill much impeach the justice of the state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations
these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor
well gaoler on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not
enter portia nerissa lorenzo jessica and balthazar
madam although i speak it in your presence you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord
but if you knew to whom you show this honour how true a gentleman you send relief how dear a lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of the work than customary bounty can enforce you
i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord
if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty
this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it
lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord’s return
for mine own part i have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord’s return
there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide
i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you
madam with all my heart i shall obey you in all fair commands
my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself
so fare you well till we shall meet again
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
i wish your ladyship all heart’s content
i thank you for your wish and am well pleas’d to wish it back on you
exeunt jessica and lorenzo now balthazar as i have ever found thee honest true so let me find thee still
take this same letter and use thou all th’ endeavour of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin’s hands doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagin’d speed unto the traject to the common ferry which trades to venice
waste no time in words but get thee gone
i shall be there before thee
madam i go with all convenient speed
come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we’ll see our husbands before they think of us
they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack
i’ll hold thee any wager when we are both accoutered like young men i’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal
then i’ll repent and wish for all that that i had not kill’d them
and twenty of these puny lies i’ll tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school about a twelvemonth
i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise
why shall we turn to men
fie what a question’s that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter
but come i’ll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today
yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore i promise you i fear you
i was always plain with you and so now i speak my agitation of the matter
therefore be of good cheer for truly i think you are damn’d
there is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither
and what hope is that i pray thee
marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the jew’s daughter
that were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me
truly then i fear you are damn’d both by father and mother thus when i shun scylla your father i fall into charybdis your mother
well you are gone both ways
i shall be saved by my husband
he hath made me a christian
truly the more to blame he we were christians enow before e’en as many as could well live one by another
this making of christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be pork eaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
i’ll tell my husband launcelet what you say
i shall grow jealous of you shortly launcelet if you thus get my wife into corners
nay you need nor fear us lorenzo
he tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven because i am a jew’s daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting jews to christians you raise the price of pork
i shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro’s belly
the moor is with child by you launcelet
it is much that the moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than i took her for
how every fool can play upon the word
i think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots
go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner
that is done sir they have all stomachs
goodly lord what a wit snapper are you
that is done too sir only “cover” is the word
wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant
i pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner
for the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern
o dear discretion how his words are suited
the fool hath planted in his memory an army of good words and i do know a many fools that stand in better place garnish’d like him that for a tricksy word defy the matter
and now good sweet say thy opinion how dost thou like the lord bassanio’s wife
it is very meet the lord bassanio live an upright life for having such a blessing in his lady he finds the joys of heaven here on earth and if on earth he do not merit it in reason he should never come to heaven
why if two gods should play some heavenly match and on the wager lay two earthly women and portia one there must be something else pawn’d with the other for the poor rude world hath not her fellow
even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife
nay but ask my opinion too of that
first let us go to dinner
nay let me praise you while i have a stomach
no pray thee let it serve for table talk
then howsome’er thou speak’st ’mong other things i shall digest it
exeunt act iv scene i venice
enter the duke the magnificoes antonio bassanio gratiano salerio and others
i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity void and empty from any dram of mercy
i have heard your grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy’s reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am arm’d to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his
go one and call the jew into the court
he is ready at the door
make room and let him stand before our face
we all expect a gentle answer jew
i have possess’d your grace of what i purpose and by our holy sabbath have i sworn to have the due and forfeit of my bond
if you deny it let the danger light upon your charter and your city’s freedom
you’ll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats
i’ll not answer that but say it is my humour
what if my house be troubled with a rat and i be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats to have it ban’d
some men there are love not a gaping pig some that are mad if they behold a cat and others when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose cannot contain their urine for affection mistress of passion sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes
now for your answer as there is no firm reason to be render’d why he cannot abide a gaping pig why he a harmless necessary cat why he a woollen bagpipe but of force must yield to such inevitable shame as to offend himself being offended so can i give no reason nor i will not more than a lodg’d hate and a certain loathing i bear antonio that i follow thus a losing suit against him
this is no answer thou unfeeling man to excuse the current of thy cruelty
i am not bound to please thee with my answer
do all men kill the things they do not love
hates any man the thing he would not kill
every offence is not a hate at first
what wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
i pray you think you question with the jew
you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften that—than which what’s harder — his jewish heart
therefore i do beseech you make no moe offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency
let me have judgment and the jew his will
for thy three thousand ducats here is six
if every ducat in six thousand ducats were in six parts and every part a ducat i would not draw them i would have my bond
how shalt thou hope for mercy rend’ring none
what judgment shall i dread doing no wrong
you have among you many a purchas’d slave which like your asses and your dogs and mules you use in abject and in slavish parts because you bought them
shall i say to you “let them be free marry them to your heirs
let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be season’d with such viands”
you will answer “the slaves are ours ” so do i answer you the pound of flesh which i demand of him is dearly bought ’tis mine and i will have it
if you deny me fie upon your law
there is no force in the decrees of venice
upon my power i may dismiss this court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here today
my lord here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor new come from padua
the jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me
you cannot better be employ’d bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph
enter nerissa dressed like a lawyer’s clerk
came you from padua from bellario
why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh jew thou mak’st thy knife keen
but no metal can no not the hangman’s axe bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy
no none that thou hast wit enough to make
o be thou damn’d inexecrable dog
and for thy life let justice be accus’d thou almost mak’st me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse themselves into the trunks of men
thy currish spirit govern’d a wolf who hang’d for human slaughter even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet and whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam infus’d itself in thee for thy desires are wolfish bloody starv’d and ravenous
till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud
repair thy wit good youth or it will fall to cureless ruin
this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court
he attendeth here hard by to know your answer whether you’ll admit him
with all my heart some three or four of you go give him courteous conduct to this place
meantime the court shall hear bellario’s letter
reads your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome
i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant
we turn’d o’er many books together
he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your grace’s request in my stead
i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head
i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation you hear the learn’d bellario what he writes and here i take it is the doctor come
enter portia dressed like a doctor of laws
are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court
i am informed throughly of the cause
antonio and old shylock both stand forth
of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed
you stand within his danger do you not
then must the jew be merciful
the quality of mercy is not strain’d it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath
it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
’tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown
his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god’s when mercy seasons justice
therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation
we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy
i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there
i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond
is he not able to discharge the money
yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times o’er on forfeit of my hands my head my heart
if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth
and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority
to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will
it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established ’twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state
o wise young judge how i do honour thee
i pray you let me look upon the bond
here ’tis most reverend doctor here it is
shylock there’s thrice thy money offered thee
i have an oath in heaven
shall i lay perjury upon my soul
why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant’s heart
be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
when it is paid according to the tenour
it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound
i charge you by the law whereof you are a well deserving pillar proceed to judgment
by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me
i stay here on my bond
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment
why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife
for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond
o wise and upright judge how much more elder art thou than thy looks
ay his breast so says the bond doth it not noble judge
“nearest his heart” those are the very words
are there balance here to weigh the flesh
have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
is it so nominated in the bond
it is not so express’d but what of that
’twere good you do so much for charity
i cannot find it ’tis not in the bond
you merchant have you anything to say
i am arm’d and well prepar’d
fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which ling’ring penance of such misery doth she cut me off
commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonio’s end say how i lov’d you speak me fair in death
and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love
repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt
for if the jew do cut but deep enough i’ll pay it instantly with all my heart
antonio i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself but life itself my wife and all the world are not with me esteem’d above thy life
i would lose all ay sacrifice them all here to this devil to deliver you
your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer
i have a wife who i protest i love
i would she were in heaven so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew
’tis well you offer it behind her back the wish would make else an unquiet house
i have a daughter— would any of the stock of barabbas had been her husband rather than a christian
we trifle time i pray thee pursue sentence
a pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it
and you must cut this flesh from off his breast
the law allows it and the court awards it
tarry a little there is something else
this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
the words expressly are “a pound of flesh” take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice
for as thou urgest justice be assur’d thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st
pay the bond thrice and let the christian go
the jew shall have all justice
he shall have nothing but the penalty
o jew an upright judge a learned judge
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou tak’st more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
a second daniel a daniel jew
now infidel i have you on the hip
give me my principal and let me go
i have it ready for thee
he hath refus’d it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond
a daniel still say i a second daniel
i thank thee jew for teaching me that word
shall i not have barely my principal
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew
why then the devil give him good of it
the law hath yet another hold on you
it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party ’gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offender’s life lies in the mercy of the duke only ’gainst all other voice
in which predicament i say thou stand’st for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurr’d the danger formerly by me rehears’d
down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself and yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state thou hast not left the value of a cord therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge
that thou shalt see the difference of our spirit i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
for half thy wealth it is antonio’s the other half comes to the general state which humbleness may drive unto a fine
ay for the state not for antonio
nay take my life and all pardon not that
you take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live
what mercy can you render him antonio
a halter gratis nothing else for god’s sake
so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter
two things provided more that for this favour he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possess’d unto his son lorenzo and his daughter
he shall do this or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here
clerk draw a deed of gift
i pray you give me leave to go from hence i am not well send the deed after me and i will sign it
get thee gone but do it
in christ’ning shalt thou have two god fathers
had i been judge thou shouldst have had ten more to bring thee to the gallows not to the font
sir i entreat you home with me to dinner
i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not
antonio gratify this gentleman for in my mind you are much bound to him
exeunt duke and his train bassanio
most worthy gentleman i and my friend have by your wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties in lieu whereof three thousand ducats due unto the jew we freely cope your courteous pains withal
and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore
he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary
i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave
dear sir of force i must attempt you further
take some remembrance of us as a tribute not as fee
grant me two things i pray you not to deny me and to pardon me
you press me far and therefore i will yield
give me your gloves i’ll wear them for your sake
and for your love i’ll take this ring from you
do not draw back your hand i’ll take no more and you in love shall not deny me this
alas it is a trifle i will not shame myself to give you this
i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it
there’s more depends on this than on the value
the dearest ring in venice will i give you and find it out by proclamation only for this i pray you pardon me
i see sir you are liberal in offers
you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answer’d
good sir this ring was given me by my wife and when she put it on she made me vow that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it
that ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts
and if your wife be not a mad woman and know how well i have deserv’d this ring she would not hold out enemy for ever for giving it to me
my lord bassanio let him have the ring
let his deservings and my love withal be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment
go gratiano run and overtake him give him the ring and bring him if thou canst unto antonio’s house
exit gratiano come you and i will thither presently and in the morning early will we both fly toward belmont
inquire the jew’s house out give him this deed and let him sign it we’ll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home
this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo
fair sir you are well o’erta’en
my lord bassanio upon more advice hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat your company at dinner
that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him
furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylock’s house
sir i would speak with you
i’ll see if i can get my husband’s ring which i did make him swear to keep for ever
we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but we’ll outface them and outswear them too
thou know’st where i will tarry
come good sir will you show me to this house
exeunt act v scene i belmont
in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the trojan walls and sigh’d his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night
in such a night did thisby fearfully o’ertrip the dew and saw the lion’s shadow ere himself and ran dismay’d away
in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage
in such a night medea gathered the enchanted herbs that did renew old æson
in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont
in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well stealing her soul with many vows of faith and ne’er a true one
in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her
i would out night you did no body come but hark i hear the footing of a man
who comes so fast in silence of the night
your name i pray you friend
stephano is my name and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at belmont
she doth stray about by holy crosses where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours
none but a holy hermit and her maid
i pray you is my master yet return’d
he is not nor we have not heard from him
but go we in i pray thee jessica and ceremoniously let us prepare some welcome for the mistress of the house
tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news
my master will be here ere morning
sweet soul let’s in and there expect their coming
and yet no matter why should we go in
my friend stephano signify i pray you within the house your mistress is at hand and bring your music forth into the air
exit stephano how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony
look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold
there’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the young eyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
and wake diana with a hymn
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear and draw her home with music
i am never merry when i hear sweet music
the reason is your spirits are attentive
for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since naught so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature
the man that hath no music in himself nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus
let no such man be trusted
that light we see is burning in my hall
how far that little candle throws his beams
so shines a good deed in a naughty world
when the moon shone we did not see the candle
so doth the greater glory dim the less
a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters
it is your music madam of the house
nothing is good i see without respect
methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
silence bestows that virtue on it madam
the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren
how many things by season season’d are to their right praise and true perfection
how the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awak’d
that is the voice or i am much deceiv’d of portia
he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice
we have been praying for our husbands’ welfare which speed we hope the better for our words
madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming
give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you
your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet
we are no tell tales madam fear you not
this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler
’tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid
enter bassanio antonio gratiano and their followers
we should hold day with the antipodes if you would walk in absence of the sun
let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me
you are welcome home my lord
this is the man this is antonio to whom i am so infinitely bound
you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you
no more than i am well acquitted of
sir you are very welcome to our house
it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy
by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong in faith i gave it to the judge’s clerk
would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart
about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutlers’ poetry upon a knife “love me and leave me not ” nerissa
what talk you of the posy or the value
you swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death and that it should lie with you in your grave
though not for me yet for your vehement oaths you should have been respective and have kept it
no god’s my judge the clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it
he will and if he live to be a man
ay if a woman live to be a man
now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judge’s clerk a prating boy that begg’d it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him
you were to blame —i must be plain with you — to part so slightly with your wife’s first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh
i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters
now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an ’twere to me i should be mad at it
aside why i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it
my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begg’d it and indeed deserv’d it too
and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he begg’d mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings
what ring gave you my lord
not that i hope which you receiv’d of me
if i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it but you see my finger hath not the ring upon it it is gone
even so void is your false heart of truth
by heaven i will ne’er come in your bed until i see the ring
nor i in yours till i again see mine
sweet portia if you did know to whom i gave the ring if you did know for whom i gave the ring and would conceive for what i gave the ring and how unwillingly i left the ring when nought would be accepted but the ring you would abate the strength of your displeasure
if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honour to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring
what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleas’d to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony
nerissa teaches me what to believe i’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring
no by my honour madam by my soul no woman had it but a civil doctor which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begg’d the ring the which i did deny him and suffer’d him to go displeas’d away even he that had held up the very life of my dear friend
what should i say sweet lady
i was enforc’d to send it after him
i was beset with shame and courtesy
my honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it
pardon me good lady for by these blessed candles of the night had you been there i think you would have begg’d the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
let not that doctor e’er come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you i’ll not deny him anything i have no not my body nor my husband’s bed
know him i shall i am well sure of it
lie not a night from home
watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honour which is yet mine own i’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow
therefore be well advis’d how you do leave me to mine own protection
let not me take him then for if i do i’ll mar the young clerk’s pen
i am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels
portia forgive me this enforced wrong and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself— portia
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one
swear by your double self and there’s an oath of credit
pardon this fault and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee
i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husband’s ring had quite miscarried
i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly
then you shall be his surety
give him this and bid him keep it better than the other
here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring
by heaven it is the same i gave the doctor
i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me
and pardon me my gentle gratiano for that same scrubbed boy the doctor’s clerk in lieu of this last night did lie with me
why this is like the mending of highways in summer where the ways are fair enough
what are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it
here is a letter read it at your leisure
it comes from padua from bellario
there you shall find that portia was the doctor nerissa there her clerk
lorenzo here shall witness i set forth as soon as you and even but now return’d
i have not yet enter’d my house
antonio you are welcome and i have better news in store for you than you expect unseal this letter soon
there you shall find three of your argosies are richly come to harbour suddenly
you shall not know by what strange accident i chanced on this letter
were you the doctor and i knew you not
were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
ay but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man
sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
when i am absent then lie with my wife
sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to road
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you
ay and i’ll give them him without a fee
there do i give to you and jessica from the rich jew a special deed of gift after his death of all he dies possess’d of
fair ladies you drop manna in the way of starved people
it is almost morning and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full
let us go in and charge us there upon inter’gatories and we will answer all things faithfully
the first inter’gatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay or go to bed now being two hours to day
but were the day come i should wish it dark till i were couching with the doctor’s clerk
well while i live i’ll fear no other thing so sore as keeping safe nerissa’s ring

reads ask me no reason why i love you for though love use reason for his precisian he admits him not for his counsellor
you are not young no more am i go to then there s sympathy
you are merry so am i ha
you love sack and so do i would you desire better sympathy
let it suffice thee mistress page at the least if the love of soldier can suffice that i love thee
i will not say pity me tis not a soldier like phrase but i say love me
by me thine own true knight by day or night or any kind of light with all his might for thee to fight john falstaff
what a herod of jewry is this
one that is well nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant
what an unweighed behaviour hath this flemish drunkard pick d with the devil s name
out of my conversation that he dares in this manner assay me
why he hath not been thrice in my company
what should i say to him
i was then frugal of my mirth
why i ll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men
how shall i be reveng d on him
for reveng d i will be as sure as his guts are made of puddings
trust me i was going to your house
and trust me i was coming to you
you look very ill mrs ford
nay i ll ne er believe that i have to show to the contrary
faith but you do in my mind
well i do then yet i say i could show you to the contrary
o mistress page give me some counsel
o woman if it were not for one trifling respect i could come to such honour
hang the trifle woman take the honour
dispense with trifles what is it
if i would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so i could be knighted
these knights will hack and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry
here read read perceive how i might be knighted
i shall think the worse of fat men as long as i have an eye to make difference of men s liking
and yet he would not swear prais d women s modesty and gave such orderly and well behaved reproof to all uncomeliness that i would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the hundredth psalm to the tune of greensleeves
what tempest i trow threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his belly ashore at windsor
how shall i be revenged on him
i think the best way were to entertain him with hope till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease
did you ever hear the like
letter for letter but that the name of page and ford differs
to thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions here s the twin brother of thy letter but let thine inherit first for i protest mine never shall
i warrant he hath a thousand of these letters writ with blank space for different names sure more and these are of the second edition
he will print them out of doubt for he cares not what he puts into the press when he would put us two
i had rather be a giantess and lie under mount pelion
well i will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man
why this is the very same the very hand the very words
what doth he think of us
nay i know not it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty
i ll entertain myself like one that i am not acquainted withal for sure unless he know some strain in me that i know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury
i ll be sure to keep him above deck
so will i if he come under my hatches i ll never to sea again
let s be reveng d on him let s appoint him a meeting give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead him on with a fine baited delay till he hath pawn d his horses to mine host of the garter
nay i will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty
o that my husband saw this letter
it would give eternal food to his jealousy
why look where he comes and my good man too he s as far from jealousy as i am from giving him cause and that i hope is an unmeasurable distance
let s consult together against this greasy knight
they retire enter ford with pistol and page with nym ford
well i hope it be not so
hope is a curtal dog in some affairs
why sir my wife is not young
he woos both high and low both rich and poor both young and old one with another ford he loves the gallimaufry
prevent or go thou like sir actaeon he with ringwood at thy heels
take heed have open eye for thieves do foot by night take heed ere summer comes or cuckoo birds do sing
believe it page he speaks sense
aside i will be patient i will find out this
to page and this is true i like not the humour of lying
he hath wronged me in some humours i should have borne the humour d letter to her but i have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity
he loves your wife there s the short and the long
my name is corporal nym i speak and i avouch tis true
my name is nym and falstaff loves your wife
i love not the humour of bread and cheese and there s the humour of it
the humour of it quoth a
here s a fellow frights english out of his wits
i never heard such a drawling affecting rogue
if i do find it well
i will not believe such a cataian though the priest o th town commended him for a true man
mistress page and mistress ford come forward page

exeunt mistress page mistress ford and mistress quickly page
you heard what this knave told me did you not
yes and you heard what the other told me
do you think there is truth in them
i do not think the knight would offer it but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men very rogues now they be out of service
i like it never the better for that
does he lie at the garter
if he should intend this voyage toward my wife i would turn her loose to him and what he gets more of her than sharp words let it lie on my head
i do not misdoubt my wife but i would be loath to turn them together
a man may be too confident
i would have nothing lie on my head
look where my ranting host of the garter comes
there is either liquor in his pate or money in his purse when he looks so merrily
to shallow following cavaleiro justice i say
i follow mine host i follow
good even and twenty good master page

though page be a secure fool and stands so firmly on his wife s frailty yet i cannot put off my opinion so easily
she was in his company at page s house and what they made there i know not
well i will look further into t and i have a disguise to sound falstaff
if i find her honest i lose not my labour if she be otherwise tis labour well bestowed
a room in the garter inn enter falstaff and pistol falstaff
i will not lend thee a penny
i will retort the sum in equipage
why then the world s mine oyster
which i with sword will open
i have been content sir you should lay my countenance to pawn

i am damn d in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows and when mistress bridget lost the handle of her fan i took t upon mine honour thou hadst it not
think st thou i ll endanger my soul gratis
at a word hang no more about me i am no gibbet for you
go a short knife and a throng to your manor of pickt hatch go
you ll not bear a letter for me you rogue
why thou unconfinable baseness it is as much as i can do to keep the terms of my honour precise
i i i myself sometimes leaving the fear of god on the left hand and hiding mine honour in my necessity am fain to shuffle to hedge and to lurch and yet you rogue will ensconce your rags your cat a mountain looks your red lattice phrases and your bold beating oaths under the shelter of your honour
you will not do it you

exit bardolph such brooks are welcome to me that o erflows such liquor
mistress ford and mistress page have i encompass d you

i make bold to press with so little preparation upon you
sir i am a gentleman that have spent much my name is brook
good master brook i desire more acquaintance of you
good sir john i sue for yours not to charge you for i must let you understand i think myself in better plight for a lender than you are the which hath something embold ned me to this unseason d intrusion for they say if money go before all ways do lie open
money is a good soldier sir and will on
troth and i have a bag of money here troubles me if you will help to bear it sir john take all or half for easing me of the carriage
sir i know not how i may deserve to be your porter
i will tell you sir if you will give me the hearing

sir i hear you are a scholar i will be brief with you and you have been a man long known to me though i had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you
i shall discover a thing to you wherein i must very much lay open mine own imperfection but good sir john as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded turn another into the register of your own that i may pass with a reproof the easier sith you yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender
there is a gentlewoman in this town her husband s name is ford
i have long lov d her and i protest to you bestowed much on her followed her with a doting observance engross d opportunities to meet her fee d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her not only bought many presents to give her but have given largely to many to know what she would have given briefly i have pursu d her as love hath pursued me which hath been on the wing of all occasions
but whatsoever i have merited either in my mind or in my means meed i am sure i have received none unless experience be a jewel that i have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues pursuing that that flies and flying what pursues
have you receiv d no promise of satisfaction at her hands
have you importun d her to such a purpose
of what quality was your love then
like a fair house built on another man s ground so that i have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where erected it
to what purpose have you unfolded this to me
when i have told you that i have told you all
some say that though she appear honest to me yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her
now sir john here is the heart of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in your place and person generally allow d for your many war like courtlike and learned preparations
believe it for you know it
there is money spend it spend it spend more spend all i have only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this ford s wife use your art of wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you may as soon as any
would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that i should win what you would enjoy
methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
she dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares not present itself she is too bright to be look d against
now could i come to her with any detection in my hand my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves i could drive her then from the ward of her purity her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her defences which now are too too strongly embattl d against me
what say you to t sir john
master brook i will first make bold with your money next give me your hand and last as i am a gentleman you shall if you will enjoy ford s wife
want no money sir john you shall want none
want no mistress ford master brook you shall want none

come you to me at night you shall know how i speed
i am blest in your acquaintance
i know him not yet i wrong him to call him poor they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money for the which his wife seems to me well favour d
i will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue s coffer and there s my harvest home
i would you knew ford sir that you might avoid him if you saw him
hang him mechanical salt butter rogue
i will stare him out of his wits i will awe him with my cudgel it shall hang like a meteor o er the cuckold s horns
master brook thou shalt know i will predominate over the peasant and thou shalt lie with his wife
come to me soon at night
ford s a knave and i will aggravate his style thou master brook shalt know him for knave and cuckold
come to me soon at night
what a damn d epicurean rascal is this
my heart is ready to crack with impatience
who says this is improvident jealousy
my wife hath sent to him the hour is fix d the match is made
would any man have thought this
see the hell of having a false woman
my bed shall be abus d my coffers ransack d my reputation gnawn at and i shall not only receive this villainous wrong but stand under the adoption of abominable terms and by him that does me this wrong
amaimon sounds well lucifer well barbason well yet they are devils additions the names of fiends

how so sir did she change her determination
master brook but the peaking cornuto her husband master brook dwelling in a continual larum of jealousy comes me in the instant of our encounter after we had embrac d kiss d protested and as it were spoke the prologue of our comedy and at his heels a rabble of his companions thither provoked and instigated by his distemper and forsooth to search his house for his wife s love
and did he search for you and could not find you
as good luck would have it comes in one mistress page gives intelligence of ford s approach and in her invention and ford s wife s distraction they convey d me into a buck basket
by the lord a buck basket
ramm d me in with foul shirts and smocks socks foul stockings greasy napkins that master brook there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril
and how long lay you there
nay you shall hear master brook what i have suffer d to bring this woman to evil for your good
being thus cramm d in the basket a couple of ford s knaves his hinds were call d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to datchet lane they took me on their shoulders met the jealous knave their master in the door who ask d them once or twice what they had in their basket
i quak d for fear lest the lunatic knave would have search d it but fate ordaining he should be a cuckold held his hand
well on went he for a search and away went i for foul clothes
but mark the sequel master brook i suffered the pangs of three several deaths first an intolerable fright to be detected with a jealous rotten bell wether next to be compass d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck hilt to point heel to head and then to be stopp d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease
think of that a man of my kidney
think of that that am as subject to heat as butter a man of continual dissolution and thaw
it was a miracle to scape suffocation
and in the height of this bath when i was more than half stew d in grease like a dutch dish to be thrown into the thames and cool d glowing hot in that surge like a horse shoe think of that hissing hot
in good sadness sir i am sorry that for my sake you have suffer d all this
my suit then is desperate you ll undertake her no more
master brook i will be thrown into etna as i have been into thames ere i will leave her thus
her husband is this morning gone a birding i have received from her another embassy of meeting twixt eight and nine is the hour master brook

now doth thy honour stand in him that was of late an heretic as firm as faith
tis well tis well no more
be not as extreme in submission as in offence but let our plot go forward
let our wives yet once again to make us public sport appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow where we may take him and disgrace him for it
there is no better way than that they spoke of
to send him word they ll meet him in the park at midnight
you say he has been thrown in the rivers and has been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come methinks his flesh is punish d he shall have no desires
devise but how you ll use him when he comes and let us two devise to bring him thither
there is an old tale goes that heme the hunter sometime a keeper here in windsor forest doth all the winter time at still midnight walk round about an oak with great ragg d horns and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle and makes milch kine yield blood and shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner
you have heard of such a spirit and well you know the superstitious idle headed eld receiv d and did deliver to our age this tale of heme the hunter for a truth
why yet there want not many that do fear in deep of night to walk by this herne s oak
marry this is our device that falstaff at that oak shall meet with us disguis d like heme with huge horns on his head
well let it not be doubted but he ll come and in this shape
when you have brought him thither what shall be done with him
that likewise have we thought upon and thus nan page my daughter and my little son and three or four more of their growth we ll dress like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads and rattles in their hands upon a sudden as falstaff she and i are newly met let them from forth a sawpit rush at once with some diffused song upon their sight we two in great amazedness will fly
then let them all encircle him about and fairy like to pinch the unclean knight and ask him why that hour of fairy revel in their so sacred paths he dares to tread in shape profane
and till he tell the truth let the supposed fairies pinch him sound and burn him with their tapers
the truth being known we ll all present ourselves dis horn the spirit and mock him home to windsor
the children must be practis d well to this or they ll nev r do t
i will teach the children their behaviours and i will be like a jack an apes also to burn the knight with my taber
i ll go buy them vizards
my nan shall be the queen of all the fairies finely attired in a robe of white
that silk will i go buy
aside and in that time shall master slender steal my nan away and marry her at eton go send to falstaff straight

come will this wood take fire
they put the tapers to his fingers and he starts falstaff
corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire

lust is but a bloody fire kindled with unchaste desire fed in heart whose flames aspire as thoughts do blow them higher and higher
pinch him fairies mutually pinch him for his villainy pinch him and burn him and turn him about till candles and star light and moonshine be out
during this song they pinch falstaff

sir john we have had ill luck we could never meet
i will never take you for my love again but i will always count you my deer
i do begin to perceive that i am made an ass
ay and an ox too both the proofs are extant
i was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv d belief in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason that they were fairies
see now how wit may be made a jack a lent when tis upon ill employment
sir john falstaff serve got and leave your desires and fairies will not pinse you
and leave you your jealousies too i pray you
i will never mistrust my wife again till thou art able to woo her in good english
have i laid my brain in the sun and dried it that it wants matter to prevent so gross o er reaching as this
am i ridden with a welsh goat too
shall i have a cox comb of frieze
tis time i were chok d with a piece of toasted cheese
seese is not good to give putter your belly is all putter
have i liv d to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of english
this is enough to be the decay of lust and late walking through the realm
why sir john do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell that ever the devil could have made you our delight
old cold wither d and of intolerable entrails
and one that is as slanderous as satan
and as wicked as his wife
and given to fornications and to taverns and sack and wine and metheglins and to drinkings and swearings and starings pribbles and prabbles
well i am your theme you have the start of me i am dejected i am not able to answer the welsh flannel ignorance itself is a plummet o er me use me as you will

if i did not think it had been anne page would i might never stir and tis a postmaster s boy
upon my life then you took the wrong

if i had been married to him for all he was in woman s apparel i would not have had him
why this is your own folly
did not i tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments
i went to her in white and cried mum and she cried budget as anne and i had appointed and yet it was not anne but a postmaster s boy
i knew of your purpose turn d my daughter into green and indeed she is now with the doctor at the dean ry and there married

you would have married her most shamefully where there was no proportion held in love
the truth is she and i long since contracted are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
th offence is holy that she hath committed and this deceit loses the name of craft of disobedience or unduteous title since therein she doth evitate and shun a thousand irreligious cursed hours which forced marriage would have brought upon her
stand not amaz d here is no remedy
in love the heavens themselves do guide the state money buys lands and wives are sold by fate
i am glad though you have ta en a special stand to strike at me that your arrow hath glanc d

now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but oh methinks how slow this old moon wanes
she lingers my desires like to a step dame or a dowager long withering out a young man’s revenue
four days will quickly steep themselves in night four nights will quickly dream away the time and then the moon like to a silver bow new bent in heaven shall behold the night of our solemnities
go philostrate stir up the athenian youth to merriments awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth turn melancholy forth to funerals the pale companion is not for our pomp
exit philostrate hippolyta i woo’d thee with my sword and won thy love doing thee injuries but i will wed thee in another key with pomp with triumph and with revelling
enter egeus hermia lysander and demetrius
happy be theseus our renownèd duke
full of vexation come i with complaint against my child my daughter hermia
my noble lord this man hath my consent to marry her
and my gracious duke this man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child
thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes and interchang’d love tokens with my child
thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love and stol’n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gauds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth with cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart turn’d her obedience which is due to me to stubborn harshness
and my gracious duke be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius i beg the ancient privilege of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case
to you your father should be as a god one that compos’d your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it
but in this kind wanting your father’s voice the other must be held the worthier
i would my father look’d but with my eyes
rather your eyes must with his judgment look
i do entreat your grace to pardon me
i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius
either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men
therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your father’s choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mew’d to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
thrice blessèd they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distill’d than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness
so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwishèd yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty
take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealing day betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father’s will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on diana’s altar to protest for aye austerity and single life
relent sweet hermia and lysander yield thy crazèd title to my certain right
you have her father’s love demetrius
scornful lysander true he hath my love and what is mine my love shall render him and she is mine and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius
i am my lord as well deriv’d as he as well possess’d my love is more than his my fortunes every way as fairly rank’d if not with vantage as demetrius’ and which is more than all these boasts can be i am belov’d of beauteous hermia
why should not i then prosecute my right
demetrius i’ll avouch it to his head made love to nedar’s daughter helena and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man
i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but being over full of self affairs my mind did lose it —but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me
i have some private schooling for you both — for you fair hermia look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father’s will or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death or to a vow of single life
demetrius and egeus go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves
with duty and desire we follow you
exeunt all but lysander and hermia lysander
why is your cheek so pale
how chance the roses there do fade so fast
belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth
but either it was different in blood— hermia
too high to be enthrall’d to low
or else misgraffèd in respect of years— hermia
too old to be engag’d to young
or else it stood upon the choice of friends— hermia
to choose love by another’s eyes
or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say ‘behold ’ the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion
if then true lovers have ever cross’d it stands as an edict in destiny
then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancy’s followers
a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia
i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child
from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son
there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us
if thou lovest me then steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee
i swear to thee by cupid’s strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus’ doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burn’d the carthage queen when the false trojan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee
your eyes are lode stars and your tongue’s sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go
my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody
were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest i’d give to be to you translated
o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius’ heart
i frown upon him yet he loves me still
o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
i give him curses yet he gives me love
o that my prayers could such affection move
the more i hate the more he follows me
the more i love the more he hateth me
his folly helena is no fault of mine
none but your beauty would that fault were mine
take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place
before the time i did lysander see seem’d athens as a paradise to me
o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turn’d a heaven into hell
helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal through athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal
and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies
pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius
we must starve our sight from lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight
as you on him demetrius dote on you
how happy some o’er other some can be
through athens i am thought as fair as she
demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know
and as he errs doting on hermia’s eyes so i admiring of his qualities
things base and vile holding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity
love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wing’d cupid painted blind
nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste
wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguil’d
as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjur’d everywhere
for ere demetrius look’d on hermia’s eyne he hail’d down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolv’d and showers of oaths did melt
i will go tell him of fair hermia’s flight
then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense
but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again
a room in a cottage enter quince snug bottom flute snout and starveling
you were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip
here is the scroll of every man’s name which is thought fit through all athens to play in our interlude before the duke and duchess on his wedding day at night
first good peter quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point
marry our play is the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisbe
a very good piece of work i assure you and a merry
now good peter quince call forth your actors by the scroll
name what part i am for and proceed
you nick bottom are set down for pyramus
what is pyramus—a lover or a tyrant
a lover that kills himself most gallantly for love
that will ask some tears in the true performing of it
if i do it let the audience look to their eyes
i will move storms i will condole in some measure
to the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant
i could play ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split
the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates and phibbus’ car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates
now name the rest of the players
this is ercles’ vein a tyrant’s vein a lover is more condoling
flute you must take thisbe on you
it is the lady that pyramus must love
nay faith let not me play a woman
you shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will
and i may hide my face let me play thisbe too
i’ll speak in a monstrous little voice ‘thisne thisne ’—‘ah pyramus my lover dear
no no you must play pyramus and flute you thisbe
robin starveling you must play thisbe’s mother
you pyramus’ father myself thisbe’s father snug the joiner you the lion’s part
and i hope here is a play fitted
snug have you the lion’s part written
pray you if it be give it me for i am slow of study
you may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring
let me play the lion too
i will roar that i will do any man’s heart good to hear me
i will roar that i will make the duke say ‘let him roar again let him roar again ’ quince
if you should do it too terribly you would fright the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all
all that would hang us every mother’s son
i grant you friends if you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us
but i will aggravate my voice so that i will roar you as gently as any sucking dove i will roar you an ’twere any nightingale
you can play no part but pyramus for pyramus is a sweet faced man a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day a most lovely gentleman like man
therefore you must needs play pyramus
what beard were i best to play it in
i will discharge it in either your straw colour beard your orange tawny beard your purple in grain beard or your french crown colour beard your perfect yellow
some of your french crowns have no hair at all and then you will play bare faced
but masters here are your parts and i am to entreat you request you and desire you to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if we meet in the city we shall be dogg’d with company and our devices known
in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants
i pray you fail me not
we will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously
at the duke’s oak we meet
a wood near athens enter a fairy at one door and puck at another
fairy over hill over dale thorough bush thorough brier over park over pale thorough flood thorough fire i do wander everywhere swifter than the moon’s sphere and i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green
the cowslips tall her pensioners be in their gold coats spots you see those be rubies fairy favours in those freckles live their savours
i must go seek some dew drops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear
farewell thou lob of spirits i’ll be gone
our queen and all her elves come here anon
the king doth keep his revels here tonight take heed the queen come not within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stol’n from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling
and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the lovèd boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups and hide them there
fairy either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite call’d robin goodfellow
are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm
those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck you do their work and they shall have good luck
thou speak’st aright i am that merry wanderer of the night
i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossip’s bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her withered dewlap pour the ale
the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and ‘tailor’ cries and falls into a cough and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there
enter oberon at one door with his train and titania at another with hers
ill met by moonlight proud titania
fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company
tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord
then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stol’n away from fairyland and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida
why art thou here come from the farthest steep of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskin’d mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity
how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus
didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia whom he ravished
and make him with fair aegles break his faith with ariadne and antiopa
these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summer’s spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by pavèd fountain or by rushy brook or on the beachèd margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport
therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have suck’d up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land hath every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents
the ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard
the fold stands empty in the drownèd field and crows are fatted with the murrion flock the nine men’s morris is fill’d up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable
the human mortals want their winter here
no night is now with hymn or carol blest
therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound
and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoary headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems’ thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set
the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazed world by their increase now knows not which is which
and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original
why should titania cross her oberon
i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman
set your heart at rest the fairyland buys not the child of me
his mother was a vot’ress of my order and in the spicèd indian air by night full often hath she gossip’d by my side and sat with me on neptune’s yellow sands marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood when we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive and grow big bellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise
but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him
how long within this wood intend you stay
perchance till after theseus’ wedding day
if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts
give me that boy and i will go with thee
we shall chide downright if i longer stay
exit titania with her train oberon
thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury — my gentle puck come hither
thou rememb’rest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea maid’s music
that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all arm’d a certain aim he took at a fair vestal thronèd by the west and loos’d his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
but i might see young cupid’s fiery shaft quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon and the imperial votress passed on in maiden meditation fancy free
yet mark’d i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milk white now purple with love’s wound and maidens call it love in idleness
fetch me that flower the herb i showed thee once the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees
fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league
i’ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes
having once this juice i’ll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love
and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb i’ll make her render up her page to me
i am invisible and i will overhear their conference
i love thee not therefore pursue me not
where is lysander and fair hermia
the one i’ll slay the other slayeth me
thou told’st me they were stol’n into this wood and here am i and wode within this wood because i cannot meet with hermia
hence get thee gone and follow me no more
you draw me you hard hearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel
leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you
or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you
and even for that do i love you the more
i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you
use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you
what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be usèd as you use your dog
tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee
and i am sick when i look not on you
you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night
and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity
your virtue is my privilege for that
it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world
then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me
i’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
the wildest hath not such a heart as you
run when you will the story shall be chang’d apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger
bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valour flies
i will not stay thy questions
let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood
ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
we cannot fight for love as men may do
we should be woo’d and were not made to woo
exit demetrius i’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well
ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
i pray thee give it me
i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite over canopied with luscious woodbine with sweet musk roses and with eglantine
there sleeps titania sometime of the night lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enamell’d skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
and with the juice of this i’ll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies
take thou some of it and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth
anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady
thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on
effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
fear not my lord your servant shall do so
another part of the wood enter titania with her train
come now a roundel and a fairy song then for the third part of a minute hence some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds some war with reremice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits
sing me now asleep then to your offices and let me rest
you spotted snakes with double tongue thorny hedgehogs be not seen newts and blind worms do no wrong come not near our fairy queen chorus
philomel with melody sing in our sweet lullaby lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
never harm nor spell nor charm come our lovely lady nigh so good night with lullaby
weaving spiders come not here hence you long legg’d spinners hence
beetles black approach not near worm nor snail do no offence
philomel with melody c second fairy
what thou seest when thou dost wake squeezes the flower on titania’s eyelids do it for thy true love take love and languish for his sake
be it ounce or cat or bear pard or boar with bristled hair in thy eye that shall appear when thou wak’st it is thy dear
wake when some vile thing is near
fair love you faint with wand’ring in the wood
and to speak troth i have forgot our way
we’ll rest us hermia if you think it good and tarry for the comfort of the day
be it so lysander find you out a bed for i upon this bank will rest my head
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
nay good lysander for my sake my dear lie further off yet do not lie so near
o take the sense sweet of my innocence
love takes the meaning in love’s conference
i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it two bosoms interchainèd with an oath so then two bosoms and a single troth
then by your side no bed room me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie
now much beshrew my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied
but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid so far be distant and good night sweet friend thy love ne’er alter till thy sweet life end
amen amen to that fair prayer say i and then end life when i end loyalty
sleep give thee all his rest
with half that wish the wisher’s eyes be pressed
through the forest have i gone but athenian found i none on whose eyes i might approve this flower’s force in stirring love
weeds of athens he doth wear this is he my master said despisèd the athenian maid and here the maiden sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground
pretty soul she durst not lie near this lack love this kill courtesy
churl upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe when thou wak’st let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid
so awake when i am gone for i must now to oberon
exit enter demetrius and helena running
stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius
i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
o wilt thou darkling leave me
stay on thy peril i alone will go
o i am out of breath in this fond chase
the more my prayer the lesser is my grace
happy is hermia wheresoe’er she lies for she hath blessèd and attractive eyes
how came her eyes so bright
if so my eyes are oftener wash’d than hers
no no i am as ugly as a bear for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do as a monster fly my presence thus
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia’s sphery eyne
i see no blood no wound
lysander if you live good sir awake
waking and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake
nature shows art that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
o how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword
do not say so lysander say not so
what though he love your hermia
no i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent
not hermia but helena i love
who will not change a raven for a dove
the will of man is by his reason sway’d and reason says you are the worthier maid
things growing are not ripe until their season so i being young till now ripe not to reason and touching now the point of human skill reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes where i o’erlook love’s stories written in love’s richest book
wherefore was i to this keen mockery born
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn
is’t not enough is’t not enough young man that i did never no nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius’ eye but you must flout my insufficiency
good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do in such disdainful manner me to woo
but fare you well perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness
o that a lady of one man refus’d should of another therefore be abus’d
hermia sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near
for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings or as the heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive so thou my surfeit and my heresy of all be hated but the most of me
and all my powers address your love and might to honour helen and to be her knight
starting help me lysander help me
do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
lysander look how i do quake with fear
methought a serpent eat my heart away and you sat smiling at his cruel prey
speak and if you hear speak of all loves
then i well perceive you are not nigh
either death or you i’ll find immediately
the queen of fairies still lying asleep
enter bottom quince snout starveling snug and flute
pat pat and here’s a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal
this green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiring house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never please
first pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide
snout by’r lakin a parlous fear
i believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
not a whit i have a device to make all well
write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that pyramus is not killed indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that i pyramus am not pyramus but bottom the weaver
this will put them out of fear
well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six
no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
snout will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
i fear it i promise you
masters you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in god shield us
a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing
for there is not a more fearful wild fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to it
snout therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect ‘ladies ’ or ‘fair ladies i would wish you ’ or ‘i would request you ’ or ’i would entreat you not to fear not to tremble my life for yours
if you think i come hither as a lion it were pity of my life
no i am no such thing i am a man as other men are’ and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is snug the joiner
but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight
snout doth the moon shine that night we play our play
look in the almanack find out moonshine find out moonshine
yes it doth shine that night
why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement
ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine
then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for pyramus and thisbe says the story did talk through the chink of a wall
snout you can never bring in a wall
some man or other must present wall
and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper
if that may be then all is well
come sit down every mother’s son and rehearse your parts
pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so everyone according to his cue
what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here so near the cradle of the fairy queen
i’ll be an auditor an actor too perhaps if i see cause
thisbe the flowers of odious savours sweet quince
so hath thy breath my dearest thisbe dear
stay thou but here awhile and by and by i will to thee appear exit puck
a stranger pyramus than e’er played here
ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
most radiant pyramus most lily white of hue of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely jew as true as truest horse that yet would never tire i’ll meet thee pyramus at ninny’s tomb quince
why you must not speak that yet
you speak all your part at once cues and all —pyramus enter
your cue is past it is ‘never tire ’ thisbe
o as true as truest horse that yet would never tire enter puck and bottom with an ass’s head
if i were fair thisbe i were only thine quince
i’ll lead you about a round through bog through bush through brake through brier sometime a horse i’ll be sometime a hound a hog a headless bear sometime a fire and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
this is a knavery of them to make me afeard
snout o bottom thou art changed
what do i see on thee
you see an ass head of your own do you
this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could
but i will not stir from this place do what they can
i will walk up and down here and i will sing that they shall hear i am not afraid
sings the ousel cock so black of hue with orange tawny bill the throstle with his note so true the wren with little quill
waking what angel wakes me from my flowery bed
sings the finch the sparrow and the lark the plain song cuckoo gray whose note full many a man doth mark and dares not answer nay
for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird
who would give a bird the lie though he cry ‘cuckoo’ never so
i pray thee gentle mortal sing again
mine ear is much enamour’d of thy note
so is mine eye enthrallèd to thy shape and thy fair virtue’s force perforce doth move me on the first view to say to swear i love thee
methinks mistress you should have little reason for that
and yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays
the more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends
nay i can gleek upon occasion
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
not so neither but if i had wit enough to get out of this wood i have enough to serve mine own turn
out of this wood do not desire to go
thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
i am a spirit of no common rate
the summer still doth tend upon my state and i do love thee therefore go with me
i’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep and sing while thou on pressèd flowers dost sleep
and i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go — peaseblossom
be kind and courteous to this gentleman hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes feed him with apricocks and dewberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries the honey bags steal from the humble bees and for night tapers crop their waxen thighs and light them at the fiery glow worm’s eyes to have my love to bed and to arise and pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
nod to him elves and do him courtesies
i cry your worships mercy heartily —i beseech your worship’s name
i shall desire you of more acquaintance good master cobweb
if i cut my finger i shall make bold with you —your name honest gentleman
i pray you commend me to mistress squash your mother and to master peascod your father
good master peaseblossom i shall desire you of more acquaintance too —your name i beseech you sir
good master mustardseed i know your patience well
that same cowardly giant like ox beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house
i promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now
i desire you of more acquaintance good master mustardseed
come wait upon him lead him to my bower
the moon methinks looks with a watery eye and when she weeps weeps every little flower lamenting some enforced chastity
tie up my love’s tongue bring him silently
another part of the wood enter oberon
i wonder if titania be awak’d then what it was that next came in her eye which she must dote on in extremity
what night rule now about this haunted grove
my mistress with a monster is in love
near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus’ nuptial day
the shallowest thick skin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enter’d in a brake
when i did him at this advantage take an ass’s nole i fixed on his head
anon his thisbe must be answerèd and forth my mimic comes
when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russet pated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the gun’s report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here o’er and o’er one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls
their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there
when in that moment so it came to pass titania wak’d and straightway lov’d an ass
this falls out better than i could devise
but hast thou yet latch’d the athenian’s eyes with the love juice as i did bid thee do
i took him sleeping—that is finish’d too— and the athenian woman by his side that when he wak’d of force she must be ey’d
this is the woman but not this the man
o why rebuke you him that loves you so
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse
if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being o’er shoes in blood plunge in the deep and kill me too
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me
would he have stol’n away from sleeping hermia
i’ll believe as soon this whole earth may be bor’d and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brother’s noontide with th’ antipodes
it cannot be but thou hast murder’d him
so should a murderer look so dead so grim
so should the murder’d look and so should i pierc’d through the heart with your stern cruelty
yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere
ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds
thou driv’st me past the bounds of maiden’s patience
henceforth be never number’d among men
o once tell true tell true even for my sake
durst thou have look’d upon him being awake and hast thou kill’d him sleeping
could not a worm an adder do so much
an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung
you spend your passion on a mispris’d mood i am not guilty of lysander’s blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell
i pray thee tell me then that he is well
and if i could what should i get therefore
a privilege never to see me more
and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no
there is no following her in this fierce vein
here therefore for a while i will remain
so sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay
thou hast mistaken quite and laid the love juice on some true love’s sight
of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turn’d and not a false turn’d true
then fate o’er rules that one man holding troth a million fail confounding oath on oath
about the wood go swifter than the wind and helena of athens look thou find
all fancy sick she is and pale of cheer with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
by some illusion see thou bring her here i’ll charm his eyes against she do appear
i go i go look how i go swifter than arrow from the tartar’s bow
flower of this purple dye hit with cupid’s archery sink in apple of his eye
when his love he doth espy let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky — when thou wak’st if she be by beg of her for remedy
captain of our fairy band helena is here at hand and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover’s fee
shall we their fond pageant see
lord what fools these mortals be
the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake
then will two at once woo one
that must needs be sport alone and those things do best please me that befall prepost’rously
why should you think that i should woo in scorn
scorn and derision never come in tears
look when i vow i weep and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears
how can these things in me seem scorn to you bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
you do advance your cunning more and more
when truth kills truth o devilish holy fray
these vows are hermia’s will you give her o’er
weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh your vows to her and me put in two scales will even weigh and both as light as tales
i had no judgment when to her i swore
nor none in my mind now you give her o’er
demetrius loves her and he loves not you
waking o helen goddess nymph perfect divine
to what my love shall i compare thine eyne
o how ripe in show thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
that pure congealèd white high taurus’ snow fann’d with the eastern wind turns to a crow when thou hold’st up thy hand
o let me kiss this princess of pure white this seal of bliss
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment
if you were civil and knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury
can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too
if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts
you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena
a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes with your derision
none of noble sort would so offend a virgin and extort a poor soul’s patience all to make you sport
you are unkind demetrius be not so for you love hermia this you know i know
and here with all good will with all my heart in hermia’s love i yield you up my part and yours of helena to me bequeath whom i do love and will do till my death
never did mockers waste more idle breath
lysander keep thy hermia i will none
if e’er i lov’d her all that love is gone
my heart to her but as guest wise sojourn’d and now to helen is it home return’d there to remain
disparage not the faith thou dost not know lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense
thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so
why should he stay whom love doth press to go
what love could press lysander from my side
lysander’s love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
could not this make thee know the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so
you speak not as you think it cannot be
lo she is one of this confederacy
now i perceive they have conjoin’d all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me
have you conspir’d have you with these contriv’d to bait me with this foul derision
is all the counsel that we two have shar’d the sisters’ vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty footed time for parting us—o is all forgot
all school days’ friendship childhood innocence
we hermia like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate
so we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet a union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crownèd with one crest
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend
it is not friendly ’tis not maidenly
our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury
i am amazèd at your passionate words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face
and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates
and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent
what though i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unlov’d
this you should pity rather than despise
i understand not what you mean by this
persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
this sport well carried shall be chronicled
if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument
’tis partly my own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy
stay gentle helena hear my excuse my love my life my soul fair helena
sweet do not scorn her so
if she cannot entreat i can compel
thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
helen i love thee by my life i do i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not
i say i love thee more than he can do
if thou say so withdraw and prove it too
he will seem to break loose
take on as you would follow but yet come not
you are a tame man go
hang off thou cat thou burr
vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent
why are you grown so rude
what change is this sweet love
yes sooth and so do you
demetrius i will keep my word with thee
i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you i’ll not trust your word
what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead
although i hate her i’ll not harm her so
what can you do me greater harm than hate
i am as fair now as i was erewhile
since night you lov’d me yet since night you left me
why then you left me—o the gods forbid — in earnest shall i say
ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more
therefore be out of hope of question of doubt be certain nothing truer ’tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena
have you come by night and stol’n my love’s heart from him
have you no modesty no maiden shame no touch of bashfulness
what will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue
fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
ay that way goes the game
now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urg’d her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevail’d with him
and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low
how low am i thou painted maypole
i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
i pray you though you mock me gentlemen let her not hurt me
i was never curst i have no gift at all in shrewishness i am a right maid for my cowardice let her not strike me
you perhaps may think because she is something lower than myself that i can match her
good hermia do not be so bitter with me
i evermore did love you hermia did ever keep your counsels never wrong’d you save that in love unto demetrius i told him of your stealth unto this wood
he follow’d you for love i follow’d him but he hath chid me hence and threaten’d me to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too and now so you will let me quiet go to athens will i bear my folly back and follow you no further
let me go you see how simple and how fond i am
a foolish heart that i leave here behind
be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena
no sir she shall not though you take her part
o when she’s angry she is keen and shrewd
she was a vixen when she went to school and though she be but little she is fierce
why will you suffer her to flout me thus
get you gone you dwarf you minimus of hind’ring knot grass made you bead you acorn
you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services
speak not of helena take not her part for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her thou shalt aby it
now follow if thou dar’st to try whose right of thine or mine is most in helena
nay i’ll go with thee cheek by jole
you mistress all this coil is long of you
i will not trust you i nor longer stay in your curst company
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
my legs are longer though to run away
i am amaz’d and know not what to say
this is thy negligence still thou mistak’st or else commit’st thy knaveries willfully
believe me king of shadows i mistook
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on
and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ’nointed an athenian’s eyes and so far am i glad it so did sort as this their jangling i esteem a sport
thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
hie therefore robin overcast the night the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within another’s way
like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong and sometime rail thou like demetrius
and from each other look thou lead them thus till o’er their brows death counterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
then crush this herb into lysander’s eye whose liquor hath this virtuous property to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
when they next wake all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision and back to athens shall the lovers wend with league whose date till death shall never end
whiles i in this affair do thee employ i’ll to my queen and beg her indian boy and then i will her charmèd eye release from monster’s view and all things shall be peace
my fairy lord this must be done with haste for night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast and yonder shines aurora’s harbinger at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there troop home to churchyards
damnèd spirits all that in cross ways and floods have burial already to their wormy beds are gone for fear lest day should look their shames upon they wilfully themselves exile from light and must for aye consort with black brow’d night
but we are spirits of another sort i with the morning’s love have oft made sport and like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate all fiery red opening on neptune with fair blessèd beams turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
but notwithstanding haste make no delay
we may effect this business yet ere day
up and down up and down i will lead them up and down
i am fear’d in field and town
goblin lead them up and down
i will be with thee straight
follow me then to plainer ground
exit lysander as following the voice enter demetrius
thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
where dost thou hide thy head
thou coward art thou bragging to the stars telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars and wilt not come
i’ll whip thee with a rod
he is defil’d that draws a sword on thee
follow my voice we’ll try no manhood here
he goes before me and still dares me on when i come where he calls then he is gone
the villain is much lighter heel’d than i i follow’d fast but faster he did fly that fallen am i in dark uneven way and here will rest me
lies down for if but once thou show me thy grey light i’ll find demetrius and revenge this spite
abide me if thou dar’st for well i wot thou runn’st before me shifting every place and dar’st not stand nor look me in the face
thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see now go thy way
faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed
by day’s approach look to be visited
lies down and sleeps enter helena
o weary night o long and tedious night abate thy hours
shine comforts from the east that i may back to athens by daylight from these that my poor company detest
and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye steal me awhile from mine own company
two of both kinds makes up four
here she comes curst and sad
cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad
never so weary never so in woe bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers i can no further crawl no further go my legs can keep no pace with my desires
here will i rest me till the break of day
heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray
i’ll apply to your eye gentle lover remedy
squeezing the juice on lysander’s eye when thou wak’st thou tak’st true delight in the sight of thy former lady’s eye
and the country proverb known that every man should take his own in your waking shall be shown jack shall have jill nought shall go ill the man shall have his mare again and all shall be well

come sit thee down upon this flowery bed while i thy amiable cheeks do coy and stick musk roses in thy sleek smooth head and kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy
monsieur cobweb good monsieur get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red hipped humble bee on the top of a thistle and good monsieur bring me the honey bag
do not fret yourself too much in the action monsieur and good monsieur have a care the honey bag break not i would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag signior
give me your neaf monsieur mustardseed
pray you leave your courtesy good monsieur
nothing good monsieur but to help cavalery cobweb to scratch
i must to the barber’s monsieur for methinks i am marvellous hairy about the face and i am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me i must scratch
what wilt thou hear some music my sweet love
i have a reasonable good ear in music
let us have the tongs and the bones
or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat
truly a peck of provender i could munch your good dry oats
methinks i have a great desire to a bottle of hay good hay sweet hay hath no fellow
i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas
but i pray you let none of your people stir me i have an exposition of sleep come upon me
sleep thou and i will wind thee in my arms
fairies be gone and be all ways away
so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm
her dotage now i do begin to pity
for meeting her of late behind the wood seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flouriets’ eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms begg’d my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairyland
and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes
and gentle puck take this transformèd scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this night’s accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream
but first i will release the fairy queen
touching her eyes with an herb be as thou wast wont to be see as thou was wont to see
dian’s bud o’er cupid’s flower hath such force and blessed power
now my titania wake you my sweet queen
my oberon what visions have i seen
methought i was enamour’d of an ass
how came these things to pass
o how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
silence awhile —robin take off this head
titania music call and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense
music ho music such as charmeth sleep
now when thou wak’st with thine own fool’s eyes peep
still mucic come my queen take hands with me and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
now thou and i are new in amity and will tomorrow midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus’ house triumphantly and bless it to all fair prosperity there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded with theseus all in jollity
i do hear the morning lark
then my queen in silence sad trip we after night’s shade
we the globe can compass soon swifter than the wand’ring moon
come my lord and in our flight tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground
horns sound within enter theseus hippolyta egeus and train
go one of you find out the forester for now our observation is perform’d and since we have the vaward of the day my love shall hear the music of my hounds
uncouple in the western valley let them go
dispatch i say and find the forester
exit an attendant we will fair queen up to the mountain’s top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction
i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bay’d the bear with hounds of sparta
never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seem’d all one mutual cry
i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder
my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flew’d so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crook knee’d and dewlap’d like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but match’d in mouth like bells each under each
a cry more tuneable was never holla’d to nor cheer’d with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly
judge when you hear —but soft what nymphs are these
my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedar’s helena i wonder of their being here together
no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace of our solemnity
but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice
go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
demetrius lysander hermia and helena wake and start up
begin these wood birds but to couple now
he and the rest kneel to theseus
i pray you all stand up
i know you two are rival enemies
how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity
my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here
but as i think for truly would i speak and now i do bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither
our intent was to be gone from athens where we might be without the peril of the athenian law
enough enough my lord you have enough
i beg the law the law upon his head
they would have stol’n away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wife
my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither follow’d them fair helena in fancy following me
but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it is my love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena
to her my lord was i betroth’d ere i saw hermia
but like a sickness did i loathe this food
but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it
fair lovers you are fortunately met
of this discourse we more will hear anon
egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit
and for the morning now is something worn our purpos’d hunting shall be set aside
three and three we’ll hold a feast in great solemnity
exeunt theseus hippolyta egeus and train demetrius
these things seem small and undistinguishable like far off mountains turnèd into clouds
methinks i see these things with parted eye when everything seems double
and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own
are you sure that we are awake
it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream
do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him
and he did bid us follow to the temple
why then we are awake let’s follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams
waking when my cue comes call me and i will answer
my next is ‘most fair pyramus ’ heigh ho
stol’n hence and left me asleep
i have had a most rare vision
i have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was
man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream
methought i was—there is no man can tell what
methought i was and methought i had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought i had
the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man’s hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was
i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called ‘bottom’s dream’ because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke
peradventure to make it the more gracious i shall sing it at her death
a room in quince’s house enter quince flute snout and starveling
have you sent to bottom’s house
out of doubt he is transported
if he come not then the play is marred
it goes not forward doth it
you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he
no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens
yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice
a paramour is god bless us a thing of naught
snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married
if our sport had gone forward we had all been made men
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have ’scaped sixpence a day
an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus i’ll be hanged
he would have deserved it sixpence a day in pyramus or nothing
masters i am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if i tell you i am not true athenian
i will tell you everything right as it fell out
all that i will tell you is that the duke hath dined
get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o’er his part
for the short and the long is our play is preferred
in any case let thisbe have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion’s claws
and most dear actors eat no onions nor garlick for we are to utter sweet breath and i do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy
exeunt act v scene i athens
an apartment in the palace of theseus enter theseus hippolyta philostrate lords and attendants
’tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of
i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys
lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends
the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helen’s beauty in a brow of egypt the poet’s eye in a fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poet’s pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name
such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy
or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear
but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigur’d so together more witnesseth than fancy’s images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable
enter lovers lysander demetrius hermia and helena
here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts
more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed
come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after supper and bed time
where is our usual manager of mirth
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour
say what abridgment have you for this evening
how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight
there is a brief how many sports are ripe
make choice of which your highness will see first
reads ‘the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp ’ we’ll none of that
that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules
‘the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage ’ that is an old device and it was play’d when i from thebes came last a conqueror
‘the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceas’d in beggary ’ that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
‘a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth ’ merry and tragical
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
how shall we find the concord of this discord
a play there is my lord some ten words long which is as brief as i have known a play but by ten words my lord it is too long which makes it tedious
for in all the play there is not one word apt one player fitted
and tragical my noble lord it is
for pyramus therein doth kill himself which when i saw rehears’d i must confess made mine eyes water but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed
what are they that do play it
hard handed men that work in athens here which never labour’d in their minds till now and now have toil’d their unbreath’d memories with this same play against your nuptial
no my noble lord it is not for you i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretch’d and conn’d with cruel pain to do you service
i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it
go bring them in and take your places ladies
i love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged and duty in his service perishing
why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
he says they can do nothing in this kind
the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit
where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practis’d accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome
trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pick’d a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence
love therefore and tongue tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity
so please your grace the prologue is address’d
prologue if we offend it is with our good will
that you should think we come not to offend but with good will
to show our simple skill that is the true beginning of our end
consider then we come but in despite
we do not come as minding to content you our true intent is
all for your delight we are not here
that you should here repent you the actors are at hand and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know
this fellow doth not stand upon points
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop
a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true
indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government
his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered
enter pyramus and thisbe wall moonshine and lion as in dumb show
prologue gentles perchance you wonder at this show but wonder on till truth make all things plain
this man is pyramus if you would know this beauteous lady thisbe is certain
this man with lime and rough cast doth present wall that vile wall which did these lovers sunder and through wall’s chink poor souls they are content to whisper at the which let no man wonder
this man with lanthern dog and bush of thorn presenteth moonshine for if you will know by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn to meet at ninus’ tomb there there to woo
this grisly beast which lion hight by name the trusty thisbe coming first by night did scare away or rather did affright and as she fled her mantle she did fall which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
anon comes pyramus sweet youth and tall and finds his trusty thisbe’s mantle slain whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broach’d his boiling bloody breast and thisbe tarrying in mulberry shade his dagger drew and died
for all the rest let lion moonshine wall and lovers twain at large discourse while here they do remain
exeunt prologue pyramus thisbe lion and moonshine theseus
i wonder if the lion be to speak
one lion may when many asses do
in this same interlude it doth befall that i one snout by name present a wall and such a wall as i would have you think that had in it a crannied hole or chink through which the lovers pyramus and thisbe did whisper often very secretly
this loam this rough cast and this stone doth show that i am that same wall the truth is so and this the cranny is right and sinister through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
would you desire lime and hair to speak better
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord
pyramus draws near the wall silence
o night with hue so black
o night which ever art when day is not
o night o night alack alack alack i fear my thisbe’s promise is forgot
and thou o wall o sweet o lovely wall that stand’st between her father’s ground and mine thou wall o wall o sweet and lovely wall show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
wall holds up his fingers thanks courteous wall jove shield thee well for this
o wicked wall through whom i see no bliss curs’d be thy stones for thus deceiving me
the wall methinks being sensible should curse again
no in truth sir he should not
‘deceiving me’ is thisbe’s cue she is to enter now and i am to spy her through the wall
you shall see it will fall pat as i told you
o wall full often hast thou heard my moans for parting my fair pyramus and me
my cherry lips have often kiss’d thy stones thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
i see a voice now will i to the chink to spy an i can hear my thisbe’s face
my love thou art my love i think
think what thou wilt i am thy lover’s grace and like limander am i trusty still
and i like helen till the fates me kill
not shafalus to procrus was so true
as shafalus to procrus i to you
o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
i kiss the wall’s hole not your lips at all
wilt thou at ninny’s tomb meet me straightway
’tide life ’tide death i come without delay
thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away doth go
exeunt wall pyramus and thisbe theseus
now is the mural down between the two neighbours
no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning
this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard
the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them
it must be your imagination then and not theirs
if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men
here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
you ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor may now perchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
then know that i one snug the joiner am a lion fell nor else no lion’s dam for if i should as lion come in strife into this place ’twere pity on my life
a very gentle beast and of a good conscience
the very best at a beast my lord that e’er i saw
this lion is a very fox for his valour
true and a goose for his discretion
not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose
his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox
it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present
he should have worn the horns on his head
he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference
this lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present myself the man i’ the moon do seem to be
this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lantern
how is it else the man i’ the moon
he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff
i am aweary of this moon
it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time
moon all that i have to say is to tell you that the lantern is the moon i the man i’ the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog
why all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon
the lion roars thisbe runs off demetrius
truly the moon shines with a good grace
the lion tears thisbe’s mantle and exit theseus
sweet moon i thank thee for thy sunny beams i thank thee moon for shining now so bright for by thy gracious golden glittering gleams i trust to take of truest thisbe sight
but mark poor knight what dreadful dole is here
thy mantle good what stained with blood
o fates come come cut thread and thrum quail rush conclude and quell
this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad
beshrew my heart but i pity the man
o wherefore nature didst thou lions frame since lion vile hath here deflower’d my dear
which is—no no—which was the fairest dame that liv’d that lov’d that lik’d that look’d with cheer
out sword and wound the pap of pyramus ay that left pap where heart doth hop thus die i thus thus thus
now am i dead now am i fled my soul is in the sky
now die die die die die
no die but an ace for him for he is but one
less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass
how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover
she will find him by starlight
here she comes and her passion ends the play
methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus
i hope she will be brief
a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
and thus she means videlicet — thisbe
a tomb must cover thy sweet eyes
these lily lips this cherry nose these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone are gone
lovers make moan his eyes were green as leeks
o sisters three come come to me with hands as pale as milk lay them in gore since you have shore with shears his thread of silk
tongue not a word come trusty sword come blade my breast imbrue and farewell friends
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
no i assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers
will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a bergomask dance between two of our company
no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse
never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed
marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe’s garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged
but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone
here a dance of clowns the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
lovers to bed ’tis almost fairy time
i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatch’d
this palpable gross play hath well beguil’d the heavy gait of night
a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollity
now the hungry lion roars and the wolf behowls the moon whilst the heavy ploughman snores all with weary task fordone
now the wasted brands do glow whilst the screech owl screeching loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud
now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the church way paths to glide
and we fairies that do run by the triple hecate’s team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallow’d house
i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door
enter oberon and titania with their train
through the house give glimmering light by the dead and drowsy fire
every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly
first rehearse your song by rote to each word a warbling note hand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place
now until the break of day through this house each fairy stray
to the best bride bed will we which by us shall blessèd be and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate
so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be and the blots of nature’s hand shall not in their issue stand never mole hare lip nor scar nor mark prodigious such as are despised in nativity shall upon their children be
with this field dew consecrate every fairy take his gait and each several chamber bless through this palace with sweet peace and the owner of it blest
ever shall it in safety rest trip away
make no stay meet me all by break of day
exeunt oberon titania and train puck
if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumber’d here while these visions did appear
and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend
if you pardon we will mend
and as i am an honest puck if we have unearnèd luck now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call
so good night unto you all
give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore amends

dramatis personæ don pedro prince of arragon
claudio a young lord of florence
benedick a young lord of padua
margaret waiting gentlewoman attending on hero
ursula waiting gentlewoman attending on hero
enter leonato hero beatrice and others with a messenger
i learn in this letter that don pedro of arragon comes this night to messina
he is very near by this he was not three leagues off when i left him
how many gentlemen have you lost in this action
but few of any sort and none of name
a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers
i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio
much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro
he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how
he hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it
i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness
did he break out into tears
there are no faces truer than those that are so washed how much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
i pray you is signior mountanto returned from the wars or no
i know none of that name lady there was none such in the army of any sort
what is he that you ask for niece
my cousin means signior benedick of padua
he is returned and as pleasant as ever he was
he set up his bills here in messina and challenged cupid at the flight and my uncle’s fool reading the challenge subscribed for cupid and challenged him at the bird bolt
i pray you how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars
but how many hath he killed
for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing
faith niece you tax signior benedick too much but he’ll be meet with you i doubt it not
he hath done good service lady in these wars
you had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it he is a very valiant trencher man he hath an excellent stomach
and a good soldier too lady
and a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
a lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honourable virtues
it is so indeed he is no less than a stuffed man but for the stuffing —well we are all mortal
you must not sir mistake my niece
there is a kind of merry war betwixt signior benedick and her they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them
in our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off and now is the whole man governed with one
so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature
he hath every month a new sworn brother
very easily possible he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block
i see lady the gentleman is not in your books
no and he were i would burn my study
but i pray you who is his companion
is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil
he is most in the company of the right noble claudio
o lord he will hang upon him like a disease he is sooner caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad
if he have caught the benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured
i will hold friends with you lady
you will never run mad niece
no not till a hot january
enter don pedro don john claudio benedick balthasar and others
good signior leonato you are come to meet your trouble the fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it
never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave
you embrace your charge too willingly
i think this is your daughter
her mother hath many times told me so
were you in doubt sir that you asked her
signior benedick no for then were you a child
you have it full benedick we may guess by this what you are being a man
be happy lady for you are like an honourable father
if signior leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina as like him as she is
i wonder that you will still be talking signior benedick nobody marks you
my dear lady disdain are you yet living
is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as signior benedick
courtesy itself must convert to disdain if you come in her presence
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies only you excepted and i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart for truly i love none
a dear happiness to women they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor
i thank god and my cold blood i am of your humour for that
i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me
god keep your ladyship still in that mind so some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face
scratching could not make it worse and ’twere such a face as yours were
well you are a rare parrot teacher
a bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
i would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer
but keep your way i’ god’s name i have done
you always end with a jade’s trick i know you of old
that is the sum of all leonato signior claudio and signior benedick my dear friend leonato hath invited you all
i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartly prays some occasion may detain us longer i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart
if you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
to don john let me bid you welcome my lord being reconciled to the prince your brother i owe you all duty
i thank you i am not of many words but i thank you
please it your grace lead on
your hand leonato we will go together
exeunt all but benedick and claudio claudio
benedick didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato
i noted her not but i looked on her
is she not a modest young lady
do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
no i pray thee speak in sober judgment
why i’ faith methinks she’s too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise only this commendation i can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is i do not like her
thou thinkest i am in sport i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her
would you buy her that you enquire after her
can the world buy such a jewel
yea and a case to put it into
but speak you this with a sad brow or do you play the flouting jack to tell us cupid is a good hare finder and vulcan a rare carpenter
come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song
in mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on
i can see yet without spectacles and i see no such matter there’s her cousin and she were not possessed with a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may doth the last of december
but i hope you have no intent to turn husband have you
i would scarce trust myself though i had sworn to the contrary if hero would be my wife
is’t come to this in faith
hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion
shall i never see a bachelor of threescore again
go to i’ faith and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away sundays
don pedro is returned to seek you
what secret hath held you here that you followed not to leonato’s
i would your grace would constrain me to tell
i charge thee on thy allegiance
you hear count claudio i can be secret as a dumb man i would have you think so but on my allegiance mark you this on my allegiance he is in love
now that is your grace’s part
mark how short his answer is with hero leonato’s short daughter
if this were so so were it uttered
like the old tale my lord ‘it is not so nor ’twas not so but indeed god forbid it should be so ’ claudio
if my passion change not shortly god forbid it should be otherwise
amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
you speak this to fetch me in my lord
by my troth i speak my thought
and in faith my lord i spoke mine
and by my two faiths and troths my lord i spoke mine
that i love her i feel
that she is worthy i know
that i neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me i will die in it at the stake
thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty
and never could maintain his part but in the force of his will
that a woman conceived me i thank her that she brought me up i likewise give her most humble thanks but that i will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick all women shall pardon me
because i will not do them the wrong to mistrust any i will do myself the right to trust none and the fine is —for the which i may go the finer —i will live a bachelor
i shall see thee ere i die look pale with love
with anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love prove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid
well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt prove a notable argument
if i do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and he that hits me let him be clapped on the shoulder and called adam
well as time shall try ‘in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke ’ benedick
the savage bull may but if ever the sensible benedick bear it pluck off the bull’s horns and set them in my forehead and let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write ‘here is good horse to hire ’ let them signify under my sign ‘here you may see benedick the married man ’ claudio
if this should ever happen thou wouldst be horn mad
nay if cupid have not spent all his quiver in venice thou wilt quake for this shortly
i look for an earthquake too then
well you will temporize with the hours
in the meantime good signior benedick repair to leonato’s commend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation
i have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and so i commit you— claudio
to the tuition of god from my house if i had it — don pedro
the sixth of july your loving friend benedick
the body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly basted on neither ere you flout old ends any further examine your conscience and so i leave you
my liege your highness now may do me good
my love is thine to teach teach it but how and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good
hath leonato any son my lord
no child but hero she’s his only heir
my lord when you went onward on this ended action i looked upon her with a soldier’s eye that lik’d but had a rougher task in hand than to drive liking to the name of love but now i am return’d and that war thoughts have left their places vacant in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires all prompting me how fair young hero is saying i lik’d her ere i went to wars
thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words
if thou dost love fair hero cherish it and i will break with her and with her father and thou shalt have her
was’t not to this end that thou began’st to twist so fine a story
how sweetly you do minister to love that know love’s grief by his complexion
but lest my liking might too sudden seem i would have salv’d it with a longer treatise
what need the bridge much broader than the flood
the fairest grant is the necessity
look what will serve is fit ’tis once thou lov’st and i will fit thee with the remedy
i know we shall have revelling tonight i will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio and in her bosom i’ll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale then after to her father will i break and the conclusion is she shall be thine
in practice let us put it presently
where is my cousin your son
he is very busy about it
but brother i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of
as the event stamps them but they have a good cover they show well outward
the prince and count claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard were thus much overheard by a man of mine the prince discovered to claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you of it
hath the fellow any wit that told you this
a good sharp fellow i will send for him and question him yourself
no no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself but i will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true
go you and tell her of it
several persons cross the stage cousins you know what you have to do
i cry you mercy friend go you with me and i will use your skill
good cousin have a care this busy time
what the good year my lord
why are you thus out of measure sad
there is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore the sadness is without limit
and when i have heard it what blessings brings it
if not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance
i wonder that thou being as thou say’st thou art born under saturn goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief
i cannot hide what i am i must be sad when i have cause and smile at no man’s jests eat when i have stomach and wait for no man’s leisure sleep when i am drowsy and tend on no man’s business laugh when i am merry and claw no man in his humour
yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment
you have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest
i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plain dealing villain
i am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog therefore i have decreed not to sing in my cage
if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meantime let me be that i am and seek not to alter me
can you make no use of your discontent
i make all use of it for i use it only
i came yonder from a great supper the prince your brother is royally entertained by leonato and i can give you intelligence of an intended marriage
will it serve for any model to build mischief on
what is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness
marry it is your brother’s right hand
marry on hero the daughter and heir of leonato
being entertained for a perfumer as i was smoking a musty room comes me the prince and claudio hand in hand in sad conference i whipt me behind the arras and there heard it agreed upon that the prince should woo hero for himself and having obtained her give her to count claudio
come come let us thither this may prove food to my displeasure
that young start up hath all the glory of my overthrow if i can cross him any way i bless myself every way
you are both sure and will assist me
let us to the great supper their cheer is the greater that i am subdued
would the cook were of my mind
shall we go to prove what’s to be done
enter leonato antonio hero beatrice and others
was not count john here at supper
i never can see him but i am heart burned an hour after
he is of a very melancholy disposition
he were an excellent man that were made just in the mid way between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady’s eldest son evermore tattling
then half signior benedick’s tongue in count john’s mouth and half count john’s melancholy in signior benedick’s face— beatrice
with a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if a’ could get her good will
by my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
too curst is more than curst i shall lessen god’s sending that way for it is said ‘god sends a curst cow short horns ’ but to a cow too curst he sends none
so by being too curst god will send you no horns
just if he send me no husband for the which blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and evening
i could not endure a husband with a beard on his face i had rather lie in the woollen
you may light on a husband that hath no beard
what should i do with him
dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting gentlewoman
he that hath a beard is more than a youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a man i am not for him therefore i will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear ward and lead his apes into hell
well then go you into hell
no but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say ‘get you to heaven beatrice get you to heaven here’s no place for you maids ’ so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter for the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long
well niece i trust you will be ruled by your father
yes faith it is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy and say ‘father as it please you ’— but yet for all that cousin let him be a handsome fellow or else make another curtsy and say ‘father as it please me ’ leonato
well niece i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
not till god make men of some other metal than earth
would it not grieve a woman to be over mastered with a piece of valiant dust
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
no uncle i’ll none adam’s sons are my brethren and truly i hold it a sin to match in my kindred
daughter remember what i told you if the prince do solicit you in that kind you know your answer
the fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed in good time if the prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer
for hear me hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jig and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster till he sink into his grave
i have a good eye uncle i can see a church by daylight
the revellers are entering brother make good room
enter don pedro claudio benedick balthasar don john borachio margaret ursula and others masked
lady will you walk about with your friend
so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing i am yours for the walk and especially when i walk away
i may say so when i please
and when please you to say so
when i like your favour for god defend the lute should be like the case
my visor is philemon’s roof within the house is jove
why then your visor should be thatch’d
speak low if you speak love
well i would you did like me
so would not i for your own sake for i have many ill qualities
i love you the better the hearers may cry amen
god match me with a good dancer
and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is done
no more words the clerk is answered
i know you well enough you are signior antonio
at a word i am not
i know you by the waggling of your head
to tell you true i counterfeit him
you could never do him so ill well unless you were the very man
here’s his dry hand up and down you are he you are he
at a word i am not
come come do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit
go to mum you are he graces will appear and there’s an end
will you not tell me who told you so
nor will you not tell me who you are
that i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the ‘hundred merry tales ’ well this was signior benedick that said so
i am sure you know him well enough
did he never make you laugh
i pray you what is he
why he is the prince’s jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders none but libertines delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in his villainy for he both pleases men and angers them and then they laugh at him and beat him
i am sure he is in the fleet i would he had boarded me
when i know the gentleman i’ll tell him what you say
do do he’ll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there’s a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night
nay if they lead to any ill i will leave them at the next turning
then exeunt all but don john borachio and claudio don john
sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it
the ladies follow her and but one visor remains
and that is claudio i know him by his bearing
you know me well i am he
signior you are very near my brother in his love he is enamoured on hero i pray you dissuade him from her she is no equal for his birth you may do the part of an honest man in it
how know you he loves her
i heard him swear his affection
so did i too and he swore he would marry her tonight
come let us to the banquet
exeunt don john and borachio claudio
thus answer i in name of benedick but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio
’tis certain so the prince wooes for himself
friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood
this is an accident of hourly proof which i mistrusted not
come will you go with me
even to the next willow about your own business count
what fashion will you wear the garland of
about your neck like a usurer’s chain
or under your arm like a lieutenant’s scarf
you must wear it one way for the prince hath got your hero
i wish him joy of her
why that’s spoken like an honest drovier so they sell bullocks
but did you think the prince would have served you thus
now you strike like the blind man ’twas the boy that stole your meat and you’ll beat the post
if it will not be i’ll leave you
now will he creep into sedges
but that my lady beatrice should know me and not know me
it may be i go under that title because i am merry
yea but so i am apt to do myself wrong i am not so reputed it is the base though bitter disposition of beatrice that puts the world into her person and so gives me out
well i’ll be revenged as i may
troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame
i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren
i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped
the flat transgression of a school boy who being overjoy’d with finding a bird’s nest shows it his companion and he steals it
wilt thou make a trust a transgression
the transgression is in the stealer
yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the rod he might have bestowed on you who as i take it have stolen his bird’s nest
i will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner
if their singing answer your saying by my faith you say honestly
the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you
she misused me past the endurance of a block an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor began to assume life and scold with her
she told me not thinking i had been myself that i was the prince’s jester that i was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood like a man at a mark with a whole army shooting at me
she speaks poniards and every word stabs if her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star
i would not marry her though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed she would have made hercules have turned spit yea and have cleft his club to make the fire too
come talk not of her you shall find her the infernal ate in good apparel
i would to god some scholar would conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror and perturbation follow her
re enter claudio beatrice hero and leonato
will your grace command me any service to the world’s end
i will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on i will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of asia bring you the length of prester john’s foot fetch you a hair off the great cham’s beard do you any embassage to the pygmies rather than hold three words’ conference with this harpy
you have no employment for me
none but to desire your good company
o god sir here’s a dish i love not i cannot endure my lady tongue
come lady come you have lost the heart of signior benedick
indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for a single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it
you have put him down lady you have put him down
so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools
i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek
the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion
i’ faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i’ll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false
here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy
count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it
silence is the perfectest herald of joy i were but little happy if i could say how much
lady as you are mine i am yours i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange
speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss and let not him speak neither
in faith lady you have a merry heart
yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care
my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart
thus goes everyone to the world but i and i am sunburnt
i may sit in a corner and cry heigh ho for a husband
lady beatrice i will get you one
i would rather have one of your father’s getting
hath your grace ne’er a brother like you
your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them
no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day
but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter
your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour
no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born
niece will you look to those things i told you of
by my troth a pleasant spirited lady
there’s little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing
she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit
she were an excellent wife for benedick
my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad
count claudio when mean you to go to church
time goes on crutches till love have all his rites
not till monday my dear son which is hence a just seven night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind
come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us
i will in the interim undertake one of hercules’ labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other
i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction
my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights’ watchings
i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband
and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know
thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty
i will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practise on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice
if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods
go in with me and i will tell you my drift
it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato
yea my lord but i can cross it
any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine
how canst thou cross this marriage
not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me
i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero
i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window
what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
the poison of that lies in you to temper
go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudio —whose estimation do you mightily hold up —to a contaminated stale such a one as hero
what proof shall i make of that
proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato
look you for any other issue
only to despite them i will endeavour anything
go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as—in love of your brother’s honour who hath made this match and his friend’s reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid —that you have discovered thus
they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown
grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practice
be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats
be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me
i will presently go learn their day of marriage
in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard
i know that but i would have thee hence and here again
exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is claudio
i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet
he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthography his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes
may i be so converted and see with these eyes
i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i’ll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool
one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace
rich she shall be that’s certain wise or i’ll none virtuous or i’ll never cheapen her fair or i’ll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it please god
i will hide me in the arbour
withdraws enter don pedro leonato and claudio followed by balthasar and musicians
come shall we hear this music
how still the evening is as hush’d on purpose to grace harmony
see you where benedick hath hid himself
very well my lord the music ended we’ll fit the kid fox with a penny worth
come balthasar we’ll hear that song again
good my lord tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once
it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection
i pray thee sing and let me woo no more
because you talk of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes yet will he swear he loves
nay pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument do it in notes
note this before my notes there’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting
why these are very crotchets that he speaks notes notes forsooth and nothing
is it not strange that sheep’s guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies
well a horn for my money when all’s done
sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceivers ever one foot in sea and one on shore to one thing constant never
then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny
sing no more ditties sing no mo of dumps so dull and heavy the fraud of men was ever so since summer first was leavy
then sigh not so but let them go and be you blithe and bonny converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny nonny
by my troth a good song
and an ill singer my lord
ha no no faith thou singest well enough for a shift
aside and he had been a dog that should have howled thus they would have hanged him and i pray god his bad voice bode no mischief
i had as lief have heard the night raven come what plague could have come after it
yea marry dost thou hear balthasar
i pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady hero’s chamber window
the best i can my lord
exeunt balthasar and musicians come hither leonato what was it you told me of today that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick
ay — aside to don pedro stalk on stalk on the fowl sits
i did never think that lady would have loved any man
no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor
sits the wind in that corner
by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought
there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it
why what effects of passion shows she
aside bait the hook well this fish will bite
she will sit you to claudio you heard my daughter tell you how
you amaze me i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection
i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick
aside i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide itself in such reverence
aside he hath ta’en the infection hold it up
hath she made her affection known to benedick
no and swears she never will that’s her torment
’tis true indeed so your daughter says ‘shall i ’ says she ‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him ’ leonato
this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she’ll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all
now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of
when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet
she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her ‘i measure him ’ says she ‘by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should ’ claudio
then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her heart tears her hair prays curses ‘o sweet benedick
god give me patience ’ leonato
she doth indeed my daughter says so and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometimes afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself
it were good that benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it
he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse
and he should it were an alms to hang him
she’s an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous
in everything but in loving benedick
my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory
i am sorry for her as i have just cause being her uncle and her guardian
i would she had bestowed this dotage on me i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself
i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say
hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness
she doth well if she should make tender of her love ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it for the man —as you know all —hath a contemptible spirit
he is a very proper man
he hath indeed a good outward happiness
’fore god and in my mind very wise
he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
and i take him to be valiant
as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great discretion or undertakes them with a most christian like fear
if he do fear god a’ must necessarily keep peace if he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling
and so will he do for the man doth fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make
well i am sorry for your niece
shall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love
never tell him my lord let her wear it out with good counsel
nay that’s impossible she may wear her heart out first
well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while
i love benedick well and i could wish he would modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady
aside if he do not dote on her upon this i will never trust my expectation
aside let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry
the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of another’s dotage and no such matter that’s the scene that i would see which will be merely a dumb show
let us send her to call him in to dinner
exeunt don pedro claudio and leonato benedick
advancing from the arbour this can be no trick the conference was sadly borne
they have the truth of this from hero
they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have their full bent
i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection
i did never think to marry i must not seem proud happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending
they say the lady is fair ’tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous ’tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her
i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter
a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age
shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour
no the world must be peopled
when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married
she’s a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her
against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner
fair beatrice i thank you for your pains
i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come
you take pleasure then in the message
yea just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal
you have no stomach signior fare you well
‘against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner ’ there’s a double meaning in that
‘i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me ’ that’s as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks
if i do not take pity of her i am a villain if i do not love her i am a jew
i will go get her picture
exit act iii scene i leonato’s garden
good margaret run thee to the parlour there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursala walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheard’st us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honey suckles ripen’d by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it
there will she hide her to listen our propose
this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone
i’ll make her come i warrant you presently
now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit
my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid’s crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay
now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference
the pleasant’st angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture
fear you not my part of the dialogue
then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
they advance to the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely
so says the prince and my new trothed lord
and did they bid you tell her of it madam
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they lov’d benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it
doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon
i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never fram’d a woman’s heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak
she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endear’d
sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it
i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featur’d but she would spell him backward if fair fac’d she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antick made a foul blot if tall a lance ill headed if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none
so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth
sure sure such carping is not commendable
no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable
but who dare tell her so
if i should speak she would mock me into air o
she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit
therefore let benedick like cover’d fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling
yet tell her of it hear what she will say
no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion
and truly i’ll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with
one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking
do not do your cousin such a wrong
she cannot be so much without true judgment — having so swift and excellent a wit as she is priz’d to have —as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick
he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio
i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy
indeed he hath an excellent good name
his excellence did earn it ere he had it
come go in i’ll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow
she’s lim’d i warrant you we have caught her madam
if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps
advancing what fire is in mine ears
stand i condemn’d for pride and scorn so much
no glory lives behind the back of such
and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly
enter don pedro claudio benedick and leonato
i do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go i toward arragon
i’ll bring you thither my lord if you’ll vouchsafe me
nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it
i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid’s bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him
he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks
gallants i am not as i have been
so say i methinks you are sadder
i hope he be in love
there’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love
if he be sad he wants money
you must hang it first and draw it afterwards
where is but a humour or a worm
well everyone can master a grief but he that has it
yet say i he is in love
there is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises as to be a dutchman today a frenchman tomorrow or in the shape of two countries at once as a german from the waist downward all slops and a spaniard from the hip upward no doublet
unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is
if he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs a’ brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode
hath any man seen him at the barber’s
no but the barber’s man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls
indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
nay a’ rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that
that’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love
the greatest note of it is his melancholy
and when was he wont to wash his face
for the which i hear what they say of him
nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops
indeed that tells a heavy tale for him
conclude conclude he is in love
nay but i know who loves him
that would i know too i warrant one that knows him not
yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for him
she shall be buried with her face upwards
yet is this no charm for the tooth ache
old signior walk aside with me i have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you which these hobby horses must not hear
exeunt benedick and leonato don pedro
for my life to break with him about beatrice
hero and margaret have by this played their parts with beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one another when they meet
my lord and brother god save you
if your leisure served i would speak with you
if it please you yet count claudio may hear for what i would speak of concerns him
to claudio means your lordship to be married tomorrow
i know not that when he knows what i know
if there be any impediment i pray you discover it
you may think i love you not let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that i now will manifest
for my brother i think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed
i came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened —for she has been too long a talking of —the lady is disloyal
even she leonato’s hero your hero every man’s hero
the word’s too good to paint out her wickedness i could say she were worse think you of a worse title and i will fit her to it
wonder not till further warrant go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window entered even the night before her wedding day if you love her then tomorrow wed her but it would better fit your honour to change your mind
if you dare not trust that you see confess not that you know
if you will follow me i will show you enough and when you have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly
if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where i should wed there will i shame her
and as i wooed for thee to obtain her i will join with thee to disgrace her
i will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself
so will you say when you have seen the sequel
enter dogberry and verges with the watch
are you good men and true
yea or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation body and soul
nay that were a punishment too good for them if they should have any allegiance in them being chosen for the prince’s watch
well give them their charge neighbour dogberry
first who think you the most desartless man to be constable
hugh oatcake sir or george seacoal for they can write and read
god hath blessed you with a good name to be a well favoured man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature
both which master constable — dogberry
you have i knew it would be your answer
well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity
you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn
this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince’s name
how if a’ will not stand
why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave
if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the prince’s subjects
true and they are to meddle with none but the prince’s subjects
you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured
we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch
why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen
well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for
if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty
if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him
truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled
the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company
you have been always called a merciful man partner
truly i would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who hath any honesty in him
if you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the nurse and bid her still it
how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats
this is the end of the charge
you constable are to present the prince’s own person if you meet the prince in the night you may stay him
nay by’r lady that i think a’ cannot
five shillings to one on’t with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will
by’r lady i think it be so
well masters good night an there be any matter of weight chances call up me keep your fellows’ counsels and your own and good night
well masters we hear our charge let us go sit here upon the church bench till two and then all to bed
i pray you watch about signior leonato’s door for the wedding being there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight
adieu be vigitant i beseech you
exeunt dogberry and verges enter borachio and conrade
mass and my elbow itched i thought there would a scab follow
i will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy tale
stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and i will like a true drunkard utter all to thee
aside some treason masters yet stand close
therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats
is it possible that any villainy should be so dear
thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will
thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man
yes the fashion is the fashion
i may as well say the fool’s the fool
but seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is
aside i know that deformed a’ has been a vile thief this seven years a’ goes up and down like a gentleman i remember his name
no ’twas the vane on the house
seest thou not i say what a deformed thief this fashion is
how giddily he turns about all the hot bloods between fourteen and five and thirty
sometime fashioning them like pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting sometime like god bel’s priests in the old church window sometime like the shaven hercules in the smirched worm eaten tapestry where his codpiece seems as massy as his club
all this i see and i see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man
but art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
not so neither but know that i have tonight wooed margaret the lady hero’s gentlewoman by the name of hero she leans me out at her mistress’ chamber window bids me a thousand times good night —i tell this tale vilely —i should first tell thee how the prince claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master don john saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter
and thought they margaret was hero
two of them did the prince and claudio but the devil my master knew she was margaret and partly by his oaths which first possessed them partly by the dark night which did deceive them but chiefly by my villainy which did confirm any slander that don john had made away went claudio enraged swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw o’er night and send her home again without a husband
we charge you in the prince’s name stand
call up the right master constable
we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth
and one deformed is one of them i know him a’ wears a lock
you’ll be made bring deformed forth i warrant you
never speak we charge you let us obey you to go with us
we are like to prove a goodly commodity being taken up of these men’s bills
a commodity in question i warrant you
good ursula wake my cousin beatrice and desire her to rise
troth i think your other rebato were better
no pray thee good meg i’ll wear this
by my troth’s not so good and i warrant your cousin will say so
my cousin ’s a fool and thou art another i’ll wear none but this
i like the new tire within excellently if the hair were a thought browner and your gown ’s a most rare fashion i’ faith
i saw the duchess of milan’s gown that they praise so
by my troth ’s but a night gown in respect of yours cloth o’ gold and cuts and laced with silver set with pearls down sleeves side sleeves and skirts round underborne with a bluish tinsel but for a fine quaint graceful and excellent fashion yours is worth ten on’t
god give me joy to wear it
for my heart is exceeding heavy
’twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man
is not marriage honourable in a beggar
is not your lord honourable without marriage
i think you would have me say saving your reverence ‘a husband ’ an bad thinking do not wrest true speaking i’ll offend nobody
is there any harm in ‘the heavier for a husband’
none i think and it be the right husband and the right wife otherwise ’tis light and not heavy ask my lady beatrice else here she comes
do you speak in the sick tune
i am out of all other tune methinks
clap’s into ‘light o’ love’ that goes without a burden do you sing it and i’ll dance it
ye light o’ love with your heels
then if your husband have stables enough you’ll see he shall lack no barnes
i scorn that with my heels
’tis almost five o’clock cousin ’tis time you were ready
by my troth i am exceeding ill heigh ho
for a hawk a horse or a husband
for the letter that begins them all h margaret
well and you be not turned turk there’s no more sailing by the star
nothing i but god send everyone their heart’s desire
these gloves the count sent me they are an excellent perfume
i am stuffed cousin i cannot smell
how long have you professed apprehension
doth not my wit become me rarely
it is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap
by my troth i am sick
get you some of this distilled carduus benedictus and lay it to your heart it is the only thing for a qualm
there thou prick’st her with a thistle
benedictus why benedictus you have some moral in this benedictus
no by my troth i have no moral meaning i meant plain holy thistle
you may think perchance that i think you are in love nay by’r lady i am not such a fool to think what i list nor i list not to think what i can nor indeed i cannot think if i would think my heart out of thinking that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love
yet benedick was such another and now is he become a man he swore he would never marry and yet now in despite of his heart he eats his meat without grudging and how you may be converted i know not but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do
what pace is this that thy tongue keeps
madam withdraw the prince the count signior benedick don john and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church
help to dress me good coz good meg good ursula
exeunt scene v another room in leonato’s house
enter leonato and dogberry and verges
what would you with me honest neighbour
marry sir i would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly
brief i pray you for you see it is a busy time with me
yes in truth it is sir
what is it my good friends
goodman verges sir speaks a little off the matter an old man sir and his wits are not so blunt as god help i would desire they were but in faith honest as the skin between his brows
yes i thank god i am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than i dogberry
comparisons are odorous palabras neighbour verges
it pleases your worship to say so but we are the poor duke’s officers but truly for mine own part if i were as tedious as a king i could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship
yea and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis for i hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city and though i be but a poor man i am glad to hear it
i would fain know what you have to say
marry sir our watch tonight excepting your worship’s presence ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in messina
a good old man sir he will be talking as they say ‘when the age is in the wit is out ’ god help us
it is a world to see
well said i’ faith neighbour verges well god’s a good man and two men ride of a horse one must ride behind
an honest soul i’ faith sir by my troth he is as ever broke bread but god is to be worshipped all men are not alike alas
indeed neighbour he comes too short of you
one word sir our watch sir have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons and we would have them this morning examined before your worship
take their examination yourself and bring it me i am now in great haste as may appear unto you
drink some wine ere you go fare you well
my lord they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband
i’ll wait upon them i am ready
go good partner go get you to francis seacoal bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol we are now to examination these men
and we must do it wisely
we will spare for no wit i warrant you here’s that shall drive some of them to a non come only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the gaol
enter don pedro don john leonato friar francis claudio benedick hero beatrice c leonato
come friar francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards
you come hither my lord to marry this lady
to be married to her friar you come to marry her
lady you come hither to be married to this count
if either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined i charge you on your souls to utter it
i dare make his answer none
what men daily do not knowing what they do
why then some be of laughing as ah
father by your leave will you with free and unconstrained soul give me this maid your daughter
as freely son as god did give her me
and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift
nothing unless you render her again
sweet prince you learn me noble thankfulness
there leonato take her back again give not this rotten orange to your friend she’s but the sign and semblance of her honour
how like a maid she blushes here
what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal
comes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue
would you not swear all you that see her that she were a maid by these exterior shows
but she is none she knows the heat of a luxurious bed her blush is guiltiness not modesty
what do you mean my lord
not to be married not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
dear my lord if you in your own proof have vanquish’d the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity — claudio
i know what you would say if i have known her you will say she did embrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sin no leonato i never tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister show’d bashful sincerity and comely love
and seem’d i ever otherwise to you
i will write against it you seem to me as dian in her orb as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pamper’d animals that rage in savage sensuality
is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
sweet prince why speak not you
i stand dishonour’d that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale
are these things spoken or do i but dream
sir they are spoken and these things are true
this looks not like a nuptial
all this is so but what of this my lord
let me but move one question to your daughter and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her bid her answer truly
i charge thee do so as thou art my child
what kind of catechizing call you this
to make you answer truly to your name
who can blot that name with any just reproach
marry that can hero hero itself can blot out hero’s virtue
what man was he talk’d with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one
now if you are a maid answer to this
i talk’d with no man at that hour my lord
why then are you no maiden
leonato i am sorry you must hear upon my honour myself my brother and this grieved count did see her hear her at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed most like a liberal villain confess’d the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret
they are not to be nam’d my lord not to be spoke of there is not chastity enough in language without offence to utter them
thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgovernment
what a hero hadst thou been if half thy outward graces had been plac’d about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
but fare thee well most foul most fair
farewell thou pure impiety and impious purity
for thee i’ll lock up all the gates of love and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm and never shall it more be gracious
hath no man’s dagger here a point for me
these things come thus to light smother her spirits up
exeunt don pedro don john and claudio benedick
take not away thy heavy hand death is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wish’d for
why doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her
could she here deny the story that is printed in her blood
do not live hero do not ope thine eyes for did i think thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rearward of reproaches strike at thy life
griev’d i i had but one
chid i for that at frugal nature’s frame
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
why had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar’s issue at my gates who smirched thus and mir’d with infamy i might have said ‘no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins ’ but mine and mine i lov’d and mine i prais’d and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her why she—o
she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh
for my part i am so attir’d in wonder i know not what to say
on my soul my cousin is belied
lady were you her bedfellow last night
no truly not although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
that is stronger made which was before barr’d up with ribs of iron
and claudio lie who lov’d her so that speaking of her foulness wash’d it with tears
hear me a little for i have only been silent so long and given way unto this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have mark’d a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness bear away those blushes and in her eye there hath appear’d a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth
call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal doth warrant the tenure of my book trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error
thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury she not denies it
why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse that which appears in proper nakedness
lady what man is he you are accus’d of
they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy
prove you that any man with me convers’d at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintain’d the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death
there is some strange misprision in the princes
two of them have the very bent of honour and if their wisdoms be misled in this the practice of it lives in john the bastard whose spirits toil in frame of villainies
if they speak but truth of her these hands shall tear her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall well hear of it
time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find awak’d in such a kind both strength of limb and policy of mind ability in means and choice of friends to quit me of them throughly
pause awhile and let my counsel sway you in this case
your daughter here the princes left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your family’s old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial
marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good
but not for that dream i on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth
she dying as it must be so maintain’d upon the instant that she was accus’d shall be lamented pitied and excus’d of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lack’d and lost why then we rack the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whiles it was ours
so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell’d in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she liv’d indeed then shall he mourn — if ever love had interest in his liver — and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true
let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood
but if all aim but this be levell’d false the supposition of the lady’s death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her — as best befits her wounded reputation — in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
signior leonato let the friar advise you and though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio yet by mine honour i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body
being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me
’tis well consented presently away for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
come lady die to live this wedding day perhaps is but prolong’d have patience and endure
exeunt friar hero and leonato benedick
lady beatrice have you wept all this while
yea and i will weep a while longer
you have no reason i do it freely
surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged
how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
is there any way to show such friendship
a very even way but no such friend
it is a man’s office but not yours
i do love nothing in the world so well as you is not that strange
as strange as the thing i know not
it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as you but believe me not and yet i lie not i confess nothing nor i deny nothing
i am sorry for my cousin
by my sword beatrice thou lovest me
do not swear by it and eat it
i will swear by it that you love me and i will make him eat it that says i love not you
will you not eat your word
with no sauce that can be devised to it
you have stayed me in a happy hour i was about to protest i loved you
and do it with all thy heart
i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest
come bid me do anything for thee
you kill me to deny it
i am gone though i am here there is no love in you nay i pray you let me go
you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy
is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman
bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour —o god that i were a man
i would eat his heart in the market place
talk with a man out at a window
she is wronged she is slandered she is undone
surely a princely testimony a goodly count comfect a sweet gallant surely
that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake
but manhood is melted into curtsies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears it
i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving
by this hand i love thee
use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero
yea as sure is i have a thought or a soul
i am engaged i will challenge him
i will kiss your hand and so leave you
by this hand claudio shall render me a dear account
as you hear of me so think of me
go comfort your cousin i must say she is dead and so farewell

why this is flat perjury to call a prince’s brother villain
pray thee fellow peace i do not like thy look i promise thee
what heard you him say else
marry that he had received a thousand ducats of don john for accusing the lady hero wrongfully
flat burglary as ever was committed
yea by the mass that it is
and that count claudio did mean upon his words to disgrace hero before the whole assembly and not marry her
thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption for this
and this is more masters than you can deny
prince john is this morning secretly stolen away hero was in this manner accused in this manner refused and upon the grief of this suddenly died
master constable let these men be bound and brought to leonato’s i will go before and show him their examination
let them be in the hands— conrade
let him write down the prince’s officer coxcomb
you are an ass you are an ass
dost thou not suspect my place
dost thou not suspect my years
o that he were here to write me down an ass
but masters remember that i am an ass though it be not written down yet forget not that i am an ass
no thou villain thou art full of piety as shall be proved upon thee by good witness
i am a wise fellow and which is more an officer and which is more a householder and which is more as pretty a piece of flesh as any in messina and one that knows the law go to and a rich fellow enough go to and a fellow that hath had losses and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him
o that i had been writ down an ass
if you go on thus you will kill yourself and ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief against yourself
but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and speak comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ache with air and agony with words
no no ’tis all men’s office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no man’s virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself
therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement
therein do men from children nothing differ
i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance
yet bend not all the harm upon yourself make those that do offend you suffer too
there thou speak’st reason nay i will do so
my soul doth tell me hero is belied and that shall claudio know so shall the prince and all of them that thus dishonour her
here comes the prince and claudio hastily
good day to both of you
hear you my lords — don pedro
well fare you well my lord are you so hasty now —well all is one
nay do not quarrel with us good old man
if he could right himself with quarrelling some of us would lie low
marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword i fear thee not
marry beshrew my hand if it should give your age such cause of fear
in faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
never fleer and jest at me i speak not like a dotard nor a fool as under privilege of age to brag what i have done being young or what would do were i not old
know claudio to thy head thou hast so wrong’d mine innocent child and me that i am forc’d to lay my reverence by and with grey hairs and bruise of many days do challenge thee to trial of a man
i say thou hast belied mine innocent child thy slander hath gone through and through her heart and she lies buried with her ancestors o
in a tomb where never scandal slept save this of hers fram’d by thy villainy
you say not right old man leonato
my lord my lord i’ll prove it on his body if he dare despite his nice fence and his active practice his may of youth and bloom of lustihood
i will not have to do with you
thou hast kill’d my child if thou kill’st me boy thou shalt kill a man
he shall kill two of us and men indeed but that’s no matter let him kill one first win me and wear me let him answer me
come follow me boy come sir boy come follow me
sir boy i’ll whip you from your foining fence nay as i am a gentleman i will
god knows i lov’d my niece and she is dead slander’d to death by villains that dare as well answer a man indeed as i dare take a serpent by the tongue
i know them yea and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple scambling out facing fashion monging boys that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander go antickly show outward hideousness and speak off half a dozen dangerous words how they might hurt their enemies if they durst and this is all
come ’tis no matter do not you meddle let me deal in this
gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
my heart is sorry for your daughter’s death but on my honour she was charg’d with nothing but what was true and very full of proof
my lord my lord— don pedro
i will be heard — antonio
and shall or some of us will smart for it
exeunt leonato and antonio enter benedick
see see here comes the man we went to seek
welcome signior you are almost come to part almost a fray
we had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth
had we fought i doubt we should have been too young for them
in a false quarrel there is no true valour
i came to seek you both
we have been up and down to seek thee for we are high proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten away
it is in my scabbard shall i draw it
dost thou wear thy wit by thy side
never any did so though very many have been beside their wit
i will bid thee draw as we do the minstrels draw to pleasure us
as i am an honest man he looks pale
what though care killed a cat thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
sir i shall meet your wit in the career and you charge it against me
i pray you choose another subject
nay then give him another staff this last was broke cross
by this light he changes more and more i think he be angry indeed
if he be he knows how to turn his girdle
shall i speak a word in your ear
god bless me from a challenge
aside to claudio you are a villain i jest not i will make it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare
do me right or i will protest your cowardice
you have killed a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you
well i will meet you so i may have good cheer
i’ faith i thank him he hath bid me to a calf’s head and a capon the which if i do not carve most curiously say my knife’s naught
shall i not find a woodcock too
sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
i’ll tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the other day
i said thou hadst a fine wit
for the which she wept heartily and said she cared not
yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly
the old man’s daughter told us all
all all and moreover god saw him when he was hid in the garden
but when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible benedick’s head
yea and text underneath ‘here dwells benedick the married man ’ benedick
fare you well boy you know my mind
i will leave you now to your gossip like humour you break jests as braggarts do their blades which god be thanked hurt not
my lord for your many courtesies i thank you i must discontinue your company
your brother the bastard is fled from messina you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady
for my lord lack beard there he and i shall meet and till then peace be with him
in most profound earnest and i’ll warrant you for the love of beatrice
what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit
he is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man
but soft you let me be pluck up my heart and be sad
did he not say my brother was fled
enter dogberry verges and the watch with conrade and borachio
come you sir if justice cannot tame you she shall ne’er weigh more reasons in her balance
nay an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to
two of my brother’s men bound
hearken after their offence my lord
officers what offence have these men done
marry sir they have committed false report moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves
first i ask thee what they have done thirdly i ask thee what’s their offence sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge
rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth there’s one meaning well suited
who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to your answer
this learned constable is too cunning to be understood
sweet prince let me go no farther to mine answer do you hear me and let this count kill me
i have deceived even your very eyes what your wisdoms could not discover these shallow fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how don john your brother incensed me to slander the lady hero how you were brought into the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero’s garments how you disgraced her when you should marry her
my villainy they have upon record which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame
the lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation and briefly i desire nothing but the reward of a villain
runs not this speech like iron through your blood
i have drunk poison whiles he utter’d it
but did my brother set thee on to this
yea and paid me richly for the practice of it
he is compos’d and fram’d of treachery and fled he is upon this villainy
now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i lov’d it first
come bring away the plaintiffs by this time our sexton hath reformed signior leonato of the matter
and masters do not forget to specify when time and place shall serve that i am an ass
here here comes master signior leonato and the sexton too
re enter leonato antonio and the sexton
let me see his eyes that when i note another man like him i may avoid him
if you would know your wronger look on me
art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill’d mine innocent child
no not so villain thou beliest thyself here stand a pair of honourable men a third is fled that had a hand in it
i thank you princes for my daughter’s death record it with your high and worthy deeds
’twas bravely done if you bethink you of it
i know not how to pray your patience yet i must speak
choose your revenge yourself impose me to what penance your invention can lay upon my sin yet sinn’d i not but in mistaking
by my soul nor i and yet to satisfy this good old man i would bend under any heavy weight that he’ll enjoin me to
i cannot bid you bid my daughter live that were impossible but i pray you both possess the people in messina here how innocent she died and if your love can labour aught in sad invention hang her an epitaph upon her tomb and sing it to her bones sing it tonight
tomorrow morning come you to my house and since you could not be my son in law be yet my nephew
my brother hath a daughter almost the copy of my child that’s dead and she alone is heir to both of us give her the right you should have given her cousin and so dies my revenge
o noble sir your over kindness doth wring tears from me
i do embrace your offer and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio
tomorrow then i will expect your coming tonight i take my leave
this naughty man shall face to face be brought to margaret who i believe was pack’d in all this wrong hir’d to it by your brother
no by my soul she was not nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me but always hath been just and virtuous in anything that i do know by her
moreover sir —which indeed is not under white and black — this plaintiff here the offender did call me ass i beseech you let it be remembered in his punishment
and also the watch heard them talk of one deformed they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it and borrows money in god’s name the which he hath used so long and never paid that now men grow hard hearted and will lend nothing for god’s sake
pray you examine him upon that point
i thank thee for thy care and honest pains
your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth and i praise god for you
go i discharge thee of thy prisoner and i thank thee
i leave an arrant knave with your worship which i beseech your worship to correct yourself for the example of others
i wish your worship well god restore you to health
i humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry meeting may be wished god prohibit it
farewell my lords we look for you tomorrow
exeunt don pedro and claudio leonato
to the watch bring you these fellows on
we’ll talk with margaret how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow
pray thee sweet mistress margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice
will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty
in so high a style margaret that no man living shall come over it for in most comely truth thou deservest it
to have no man come over me
why shall i always keep below stairs
thy wit is as quick as the greyhound’s mouth it catches
and yours as blunt as the fencer’s foils which hit but hurt not
a most manly wit margaret it will not hurt a woman and so i pray thee call beatrice
give us the swords we have bucklers of our own
if you use them margaret you must put in the pikes with a vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids
well i will call beatrice to you who i think hath legs
exit margaret the god of love that sits above and knows me and knows me how pitiful i deserve — i mean in singing but in loving leander the good swimmer troilus the first employer of panders and a whole book full of these quondam carpet mongers whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a blank verse why they were never so truly turned over and over as my poor self in love
marry i cannot show it in rime i have tried i can find out no rime to ‘lady’ but ‘baby’ an innocent rime for ‘scorn ’ ‘horn’ a hard rime for ‘school’ ‘fool’ a babbling rime very ominous endings no i was not born under a riming planet nor i cannot woo in festival terms
sweet beatrice wouldst thou come when i called thee
yea signior and depart when you bid me
‘then’ is spoken fare you well now and yet ere i go let me go with that i came for which is with knowing what hath passed between you and claudio
only foul words and thereupon i will kiss thee
foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome therefore i will depart unkissed
thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit
but i must tell thee plainly claudio undergoes my challenge and either i must shortly hear from him or i will subscribe him a coward
and i pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
for them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them
but for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me
‘suffer love ’ a good epithet
i do suffer love indeed for i love thee against my will
in spite of your heart i think
if you spite it for my sake i will spite it for yours for i will never love that which my friend hates
thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably
it appears not in this confession there’s not one wise man among twenty that will praise himself
an old an old instance beatrice that lived in the time of good neighbours
if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps
and how long is that think you
question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum therefore is it most expedient for the wise —if don worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary —to be the trumpet of his own virtues as i am to myself
so much for praising myself who i myself will bear witness is praiseworthy
and now tell me how doth your cousin
serve god love me and mend
there will i leave you too for here comes one in haste
madam you must come to your uncle
yonder’s old coil at home it is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused the prince and claudio mightily abused and don john is the author of all who is fled and gone
will you go hear this news signior
i will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy eyes and moreover i will go with thee to thy uncle’s
enter don pedro claudio and attendants with music and tapers
is this the monument of leonato
done to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies death in guerdon of her wrongs gives her fame which never dies
so the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame
hang thou there upon the tomb praising her when i am dumb
now music sound and sing your solemn hymn
pardon goddess of the night those that slew thy virgin knight for the which with songs of woe round about her tomb they go
midnight assist our moan help us to sigh and groan heavily heavily graves yawn and yield your dead till death be uttered heavily heavily
now unto thy bones good night
yearly will i do this rite
good morrow masters put your torches out
the wolves have prey’d and look the gentle day before the wheels of phoebus round about dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
thanks to you all and leave us fare you well
good morrow masters each his several way
come let us hence and put on other weeds and then to leonato’s we will go
and hymen now with luckier issue speed’s than this for whom we rend’red up this woe
enter leonato antonio benedick beatrice margaret ursula friar francis and hero
did i not tell you she was innocent
so are the prince and claudio who accus’d her upon the error that you heard debated but margaret was in some fault for this although against her will as it appears in the true course of all the question
well i am glad that all things sort so well
and so am i being else by faith enforc’d to call young claudio to a reckoning for it
well daughter and you gentlewomen all withdraw into a chamber by yourselves and when i send for you come hither mask’d the prince and claudio promis’d by this hour to visit me
exeunt ladies you know your office brother you must be father to your brother’s daughter and give her to young claudio
which i will do with confirm’d countenance
friar i must entreat your pains i think
to bind me or undo me one of them
signior leonato truth it is good signior your niece regards me with an eye of favour
that eye my daughter lent her
and i do with an eye of love requite her
the sight whereof i think you had from me from claudio and the prince
your answer sir is enigmatical but for my will my will is your good will may stand with ours this day to be conjoin’d in the state of honourable marriage in which good friar i shall desire your help
my heart is with your liking
here comes the prince and claudio
enter don pedro and claudio with attendants
good morrow to this fair assembly
good morrow prince good morrow claudio we here attend you
are you yet determin’d today to marry with my brother’s daughter
i’ll hold my mind were she an ethiope
call her forth brother here’s the friar ready
why what’s the matter that you have such a february face so full of frost of storm and cloudiness
i think he thinks upon the savage bull
fear not man we’ll tip thy horns with gold and all europa shall rejoice at thee as once europa did at lusty jove when he would play the noble beast in love
bull jove sir had an amiable low and some such strange bull leap’d your father’s cow and got a calf in that same noble feat much like to you for you have just his bleat
for this i owe you here comes other reckonings
re enter antonio with the ladies masked
which is the lady i must seize upon
this same is she and i do give you her
sweet let me see your face
no that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her
give me your hand before this holy friar i am your husband if you like of me
and when i liv’d i was your other wife unmasking and when you lov’d you were my other husband
nothing certainer one hero died defil’d but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid
she died my lord but whiles her slander liv’d
all this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended i’ll tell you largely of fair hero’s death meantime let wonder seem familiar and to the chapel let us presently
unmasking i answer to that name
why no no more than reason
why then your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived for they swore you did
troth no no more than reason
why then my cousin margaret and ursula are much deceiv’d for they did swear you did
they swore that you were almost sick for me
they swore that you were well nigh dead for me
then you do not love me
no truly but in friendly recompense
come cousin i am sure you love the gentleman
and i’ll be sworn upon ’t that he loves her for here’s a paper written in his hand a halting sonnet of his own pure brain fashion’d to beatrice
and here’s another writ in my cousin’s hand stolen from her pocket containing her affection unto benedick
here’s our own hands against our hearts
come i will have thee but by this light i take thee for pity
i would not deny you but by this good day i yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for i was told you were in a consumption
how dost thou benedick the married man
i’ll tell thee what prince a college of witcrackers cannout flout me out of my humour
dost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram
no if man will be beaten with brains a’ shall wear nothing handsome about him
in brief since i do purpose to marry i will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it and therefore never flout at me for what i have said against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion
for thy part claudio i did think to have beaten thee but in that thou art like to be my kinsman live unbruised and love my cousin
i had well hoped thou wouldst have denied beatrice that i might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life to make thee a double dealer which out of question thou wilt be if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee
let’s have a dance ere we are married that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels
first of my word therefore play music
prince thou art sad get thee a wife get thee a wife there is no staff more reverent than one tipped with horn
my lord your brother john is ta’en in flight and brought with armed men back to messina
think not on him till tomorrow i’ll devise thee brave punishments for him

’sblood but you will not hear me
if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me
thou told’st me thou didst hold him in thy hate
despise me if i do not
three great ones of the city in personal suit to make me his lieutenant off capp’d to him and by the faith of man i know my price i am worth no worse a place
but he as loving his own pride and purposes evades them with a bombast circumstance horribly stuff’d with epithets of war and in conclusion nonsuits my mediators for “certes ” says he “i have already chose my officer ” and what was he
forsooth a great arithmetician one michael cassio a florentine a fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife that never set a squadron in the field nor the division of a battle knows more than a spinster unless the bookish theoric wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership
but he sir had the election and i of whom his eyes had seen the proof at rhodes at cyprus and on other grounds christian and heathen must be belee’d and calm’d by debitor and creditor this counter caster he in good time must his lieutenant be and i god bless the mark his moorship’s ancient
by heaven i rather would have been his hangman
’tis the curse of service preferment goes by letter and affection and not by old gradation where each second stood heir to the first
now sir be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affin’d to love the moor
i would not follow him then
i follow him to serve my turn upon him we cannot all be masters nor all masters cannot be truly follow’d
you shall mark many a duteous and knee crooking knave that doting on his own obsequious bondage wears out his time much like his master’s ass for nought but provender and when he’s old cashier’d
others there are who trimm’d in forms and visages of duty keep yet their hearts attending on themselves and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them and when they have lin’d their coats do themselves homage
these fellows have some soul and such a one do i profess myself
for sir it is as sure as you are roderigo were i the moor i would not be iago in following him i follow but myself
heaven is my judge not i for love and duty but seeming so for my peculiar end
for when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in complement extern ’tis not long after but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at i am not what i am
what a full fortune does the thick lips owe if he can carry’t thus
call up her father rouse him make after him poison his delight proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen and though he in a fertile climate dwell plague him with flies though that his joy be joy yet throw such changes of vexation on’t as it may lose some color
here is her father’s house i’ll call aloud
do with like timorous accent and dire yell as when by night and negligence the fire is spied in populous cities
look to your house your daughter and your bags
brabantio appears above at a window
what is the reason of this terrible summons
signior is all your family within
zounds sir you’re robb’d for shame put on your gown your heart is burst you have lost half your soul even now now very now an old black ram is tupping your white ewe
arise arise awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you arise i say
what have you lost your wits
most reverend signior do you know my voice
i have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors in honest plainness thou hast heard me say my daughter is not for thee and now in madness being full of supper and distempering draughts upon malicious bravery dost thou come to start my quiet
but thou must needs be sure my spirit and my place have in them power to make this bitter to thee
what tell’st thou me of robbing
my house is not a grange
most grave brabantio in simple and pure soul i come to you
zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve god if the devil bid you
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a barbary horse you’ll have your nephews neigh to you you’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
i am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs
but i beseech you if ’t be your pleasure and most wise consent as partly i find it is that your fair daughter at this odd even and dull watch o’ the night transported with no worse nor better guard but with a knave of common hire a gondolier to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor if this be known to you and your allowance we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke
do not believe that from the sense of all civility i thus would play and trifle with your reverence
your daughter if you have not given her leave i say again hath made a gross revolt tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes in an extravagant and wheeling stranger of here and everywhere
straight satisfy yourself if she be in her chamber or your house let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you
this accident is not unlike my dream belief of it oppresses me already
farewell for i must leave you it seems not meet nor wholesome to my place to be produc’d as if i stay i shall against the moor
for i do know the state however this may gall him with some check cannot with safety cast him for he’s embark’d with such loud reason to the cyprus wars which even now stand in act that for their souls another of his fathom they have none to lead their business
in which regard though i do hate him as i do hell pains yet for necessity of present life i must show out a flag and sign of love which is indeed but sign
that you shall surely find him lead to the sagittary the raised search and there will i be with him
exit enter brabantio with servants and torches
it is too true an evil
gone she is and what’s to come of my despised time is naught but bitterness
now roderigo where didst thou see her
how didst thou know ’twas she
o she deceives me past thought
get more tapers raise all my kindred
fathers from hence trust not your daughters’ minds by what you see them act
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused
have you not read roderigo of some such thing
o would you had had her
do you know where we may apprehend her and the moor
i think i can discover him if you please to get good guard and go along with me
at every house i’ll call i may command at most
and raise some special officers of night
enter othello iago and attendants with torches
though in the trade of war i have slain men yet do i hold it very stuff o’ the conscience to do no contriv’d murder i lack iniquity sometimes to do me service nine or ten times i had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs
nay but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honour that with the little godliness i have i did full hard forbear him
but i pray you sir are you fast married
be assur’d of this that the magnifico is much belov’d and hath in his effect a voice potential as double as the duke’s he will divorce you or put upon you what restraint and grievance the law with all his might to enforce it on will give him cable
let him do his spite my services which i have done the signiory shall out tongue his complaints
’tis yet to know — which when i know that boasting is an honour i shall promulgate —i fetch my life and being from men of royal siege
and my demerits may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune as this that i have reach’d
for know iago but that i love the gentle desdemona i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the sea’s worth
but look what lights come yond
those are the raised father and his friends you were best go in
not i i must be found
my parts my title and my perfect soul shall manifest me rightly
enter cassio and officers with torches
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant
the goodness of the night upon you friends
the duke does greet you general and he requires your haste post haste appearance even on the instant
what is the matter think you
something from cyprus as i may divine
it is a business of some heat
the galleys have sent a dozen sequent messengers this very night at one another’s heels and many of the consuls rais’d and met are at the duke’s already
you have been hotly call’d for when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several quests to search you out
’tis well i am found by you
i will but spend a word here in the house and go with you
faith he tonight hath boarded a land carrack if it prove lawful prize he’s made forever
marry to—come captain will you go
here comes another troop to seek for you
enter brabantio roderigo and officers with torches and weapons
general be advis’d he comes to bad intent
they draw on both sides iago
come sir i am for you
keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
good signior you shall more command with years than with your weapons
o thou foul thief where hast thou stow’d my daughter
damn’d as thou art thou hast enchanted her for i’ll refer me to all things of sense if she in chains of magic were not bound whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she shunn’d the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou—to fear not to delight
judge me the world if ’tis not gross in sense that thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms abus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weakens motion
i’ll have’t disputed on ’tis probable and palpable to thinking
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant — lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril
hold your hands both you of my inclining and the rest were it my cue to fight i should have known it without a prompter
where will you that i go to answer this your charge
to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer
how may the duke be therewith satisfied whose messengers are here about my side upon some present business of the state to bring me to him
’tis true most worthy signior the duke’s in council and your noble self i am sure is sent for
in this time of the night
bring him away mine’s not an idle cause
the duke himself or any of my brothers of the state cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own
for if such actions may have passage free bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
the duke and senators sitting at a table officers attending
there is no composition in these news that gives them credit
indeed they are disproportion’d my letters say a hundred and seven galleys
and mine a hundred and forty
second senator and mine two hundred but though they jump not on a just account as in these cases where the aim reports ’tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm a turkish fleet and bearing up to cyprus
nay it is possible enough to judgement i do not so secure me in the error but the main article i do approve in fearful sense
the turkish preparation makes for rhodes so was i bid report here to the state by signior angelo
how say you by this change
this cannot be by no assay of reason
’tis a pageant to keep us in false gaze
when we consider the importancy of cyprus to the turk and let ourselves again but understand that as it more concerns the turk than rhodes so may he with more facile question bear it for that it stands not in such warlike brace but altogether lacks the abilities that rhodes is dress’d in
if we make thought of this we must not think the turk is so unskilful to leave that latest which concerns him first neglecting an attempt of ease and gain to wake and wage a danger profitless
nay in all confidence he’s not for rhodes
the ottomites reverend and gracious steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes have there injointed them with an after fleet
of thirty sail and now they do re stem their backward course bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus
signior montano your trusty and most valiant servitor with his free duty recommends you thus and prays you to believe him
marcus luccicos is not he in town
write from us to him post post haste dispatch
here comes brabantio and the valiant moor
enter brabantio othello iago roderigo and officers
valiant othello we must straight employ you against the general enemy ottoman
to brabantio i did not see you welcome gentle signior we lack’d your counsel and your help tonight
neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath rais’d me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so flood gate and o’erbearing nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself
she is abused stol’n from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not
whoe’er he be that in this foul proceeding hath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself and you of her the bloody book of law you shall yourself read in the bitter letter after your own sense yea though our proper son stood in your action
here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought
we are very sorry for ’t
to othello what in your own part can you say to this
most potent grave and reverend signiors my very noble and approv’d good masters that i have ta’en away this old man’s daughter it is most true true i have married her
the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more
rude am i in my speech and little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace for since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith till now some nine moons wasted they have us’d their dearest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself
yet by your gracious patience i will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver of my whole course of love what drugs what charms what conjuration and what mighty magic for such proceeding i am charged withal i won his daughter
a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush’d at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit everything to fall in love with what she fear’d to look on
it is judgement maim’d and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be
i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood or with some dram conjur’d to this effect he wrought upon her
to vouch this is no proof without more wider and more overt test than these thin habits and poor likelihoods of modern seeming do prefer against him
but othello speak did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid’s affections
or came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth
i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagittary and let her speak of me before her father
if you do find me foul in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not only take away but let your sentence even fall upon my life
ancient conduct them you best know the place
exeunt iago and attendants and till she come as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i’ll present how i did thrive in this fair lady’s love and she in mine
her father lov’d me oft invited me still question’d me the story of my life from year to year—the battles sieges fortunes that i have pass’d
this to hear would desdemona seriously incline
but still the house affairs would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she’d come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not intentively
i did consent and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer’d
my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sighs
she swore in faith ’twas strange ’twas passing strange ’twas pitiful ’twas wondrous pitiful
she wish’d she had not heard it yet she wish’d that heaven had made her such a man she thank’d me and bade me if i had a friend that lov’d her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her
upon this hint i spake she lov’d me for the dangers i had pass’d and i lov’d her that she did pity them
this only is the witchcraft i have us’d
i think this tale would win my daughter too
good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best
men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands
i pray you hear her speak
if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man —come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience
my noble father i do perceive here a divided duty to you i am bound for life and education
my life and education both do learn me how to respect you
you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter but here’s my husband
and so much duty as my mother show’d to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may profess due to the moor my lord
please it your grace on to the state affairs
i had rather to adopt a child than get it — come hither moor i here do give thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keep from thee —for your sake jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them —i have done my lord
let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour
when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on
what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes
the robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself that spends a bootless grief
so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear
i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus
othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you
and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition
the tyrant custom most grave senators hath made the flinty and steel couch of war my thrice driven bed of down i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness and do undertake this present wars against the ottomites
most humbly therefore bending to your state i crave fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding
if you please be’t at her father’s
nor i i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye
most gracious duke to my unfolding lend your prosperous ear and let me find a charter in your voice t’ assist my simpleness
that i did love the moor to live with him my downright violence and storm of fortunes may trumpet to the world my heart’s subdued even to the very quality of my lord
i saw othello’s visage in his mind and to his honours and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate
so that dear lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the war the rites for which i love him are bereft me and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence
vouch with me heaven i therefore beg it not to please the palate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the young affects in me defunct and proper satisfaction but to be free and bounteous to her mind
and heaven defend your good souls that you think i will your serious and great business scant for she is with me
no when light wing’d toys of feather’d cupid seel with wanton dullness my speculative and offic’d instruments that my disports corrupt and taint my business let housewives make a skillet of my helm and all indign and base adversities make head against my estimation
be it as you shall privately determine either for her stay or going
the affair cries haste and speed must answer it
at nine i’ the morning here we’ll meet again
othello leave some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you with such things else of quality and respect as doth import you
so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honesty and trust to his conveyance i assign my wife with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me
to brabantio and noble signior if virtue no delighted beauty lack your son in law is far more fair than black
adieu brave moor use desdemona well
look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceiv’d her father and may thee
exeunt duke senators officers c othello
honest iago my desdemona must i leave to thee
i prithee let thy wife attend on her and bring them after in the best advantage — come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matters and direction to spend with thee
what will i do thinkest thou
why go to bed and sleep
if thou dost i shall never love thee after
it is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
i have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself
ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon
i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
’tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus
our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners
so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions
but we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion
it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness i could never better stead thee than now
put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favour with an usurped beard i say put money in thy purse
it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor —put money in thy purse —nor he his to her
it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse
these moors are changeable in their wills
the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida
when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice
she must have change she must
therefore put money in thy purse
if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning
make all the money thou canst
if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money
it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her
wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue
i have told thee often and i retell thee again and again i hate the moor
my cause is hearted thine hath no less reason
let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport
there are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered
we will have more of this tomorrow
where shall we meet i’ the morning
no more of drowning do you hear
thus do i ever make my fool my purse
for i mine own gain’d knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit
i hate the moor and it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets he has done my office
i know not if ’t be true but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety
he holds me well the better shall my purpose work on him
let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery
after some time to abuse othello’s ear that he is too familiar with his wife
he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected fram’d to make women false
the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest that but seem to be so and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are
hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light
what from the cape can you discern at sea
nothing at all it is a high wrought flood
i cannot ’twixt the heaven and the main descry a sail
methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
a fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements
if it hath ruffian’d so upon the sea what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them can hold the mortise
what shall we hear of this
a segregation of the turkish fleet
for do but stand upon the foaming shore the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds the wind shak’d surge with high and monstrous main seems to cast water on the burning bear and quench the guards of the ever fixed pole i never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood
if that the turkish fleet be not enshelter’d and embay’d they are drown’d
it is impossible to bear it out
the desperate tempest hath so bang’d the turks that their designment halts
a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet
the ship is here put in a veronessa michael cassio lieutenant to the warlike moor othello is come on shore the moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for cyprus
but this same cassio though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss yet he looks sadly and prays the moor be safe for they were parted with foul and violent tempest
pray heavens he be for i have serv’d him and the man commands like a full soldier
let’s to the sea side ho
as well to see the vessel that’s come in as to throw out our eyes for brave othello even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard
come let’s do so for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance
thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor
o let the heavens give him defence against the elements for i have lost him on a dangerous sea
his bark is stoutly timber’d and his pilot of very expert and approv’d allowance therefore my hopes not surfeited to death stand in bold cure
within a sail a sail a sail
the town is empty on the brow o’ the sea stand ranks of people and they cry “a sail ” cassio
my hopes do shape him for the governor
they do discharge their shot of courtesy
i pray you sir go forth and give us truth who ’tis that is arriv’d
but good lieutenant is your general wiv’d
most fortunately he hath achiev’d a maid that paragons description and wild fame one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens and in the essential vesture of creation does tire the ingener
’tis one iago ancient to the general
he has had most favourable and happy speed tempests themselves high seas and howling winds the gutter’d rocks and congregated sands traitors ensteep’d to clog the guiltless keel as having sense of beauty do omit their mortal natures letting go safely by the divine desdemona
she that i spake of our great captain’s captain left in the conduct of the bold iago whose footing here anticipates our thoughts a se’nnight’s speed
great jove othello guard and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath that he may bless this bay with his tall ship make love’s quick pants in desdemona’s arms give renew’d fire to our extincted spirits and bring all cyprus comfort
enter desdemona iago roderigo and emilia
o behold the riches of the ship is come on shore
ye men of cyprus let her have your knees
and the grace of heaven before behind thee and on every hand enwheel thee round
what tidings can you tell me of my lord
he is not yet arrived nor know i aught but that he’s well and will be shortly here
o but i fear—how lost you company
the great contention of the sea and skies parted our fellowship
they give their greeting to the citadel
exit gentleman good ancient you are welcome
let it not gall your patience good iago that i extend my manners ’tis my breeding that gives me this bold show of courtesy
sir would she give you so much of her lips as of her tongue she oft bestows on me you would have enough
i find it still when i have list to sleep
marry before your ladyship i grant she puts her tongue a little in her heart and chides with thinking
you have little cause to say so
come on come on you are pictures out of doors bells in your parlours wild cats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
nay it is true or else i am a turk
you rise to play and go to bed to work
you shall not write my praise
what wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me
o gentle lady do not put me to’t for i am nothing if not critical
come on assay —there’s one gone to the harbour
i am not merry but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise — come how wouldst thou praise me
i am about it but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze it plucks out brains and all but my muse labours and thus she is deliver’d
if she be fair and wise fairness and wit the one’s for use the other useth it
how if she be black and witty
if she be black and thereto have a wit she’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit
she never yet was foolish that was fair for even her folly help’d her to an heir
these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i’ the alehouse
what miserable praise hast thou for her that’s foul and foolish
there’s none so foul and foolish thereunto but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
she that was ever fair and never proud had tongue at will and yet was never loud never lack’d gold and yet went never gay fled from her wish and yet said “now i may” she that being anger’d her revenge being nigh bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail she that could think and ne’er disclose her mind see suitors following and not look behind she was a wight if ever such wight were— desdemona
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer
o most lame and impotent conclusion —do not learn of him emilia though he be thy husband —how say you cassio
is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor
you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar
aside he takes her by the palm
with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great a fly as cassio
i will gyve thee in thine own courtship
you say true ’tis so indeed
if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in
very good well kissed an excellent courtesy
yet again your fingers to your lips
would they were clyster pipes for your sake
let’s meet him and receive him
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me
if after every tempest come such calms may the winds blow till they have waken’d death
and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas olympus high and duck again as low as hell’s from heaven
if it were now to die ’twere now to be most happy for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate
the heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase even as our days do grow
i cannot speak enough of this content
it stops me here it is too much of joy and this and this the greatest discords be they kiss that e’er our hearts shall make
aside o you are well tun’d now but i’ll set down the pegs that make this music as honest as i am
come let us to the castle — news friends our wars are done the turks are drown’d
how does my old acquaintance of this isle
honey you shall be well desir’d in cyprus i have found great love amongst them
o my sweet i prattle out of fashion and i dote in mine own comforts —i prithee good iago go to the bay and disembark my coffers
bring thou the master to the citadel he is a good one and his worthiness does challenge much respect —come desdemona once more well met at cyprus
exeunt othello desdemona and attendants iago
do thou meet me presently at the harbour
if thou be’st valiant—as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them—list me
the lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in love with him
lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies
and will she love him still for prating
let not thy discreet heart think it
and what delight shall she have to look on the devil
when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the moor is defective in now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice
now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as cassio does
a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection
a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself a devilish knave
besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after
a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already
i cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition
the wine she drinks is made of grapes if she had been blessed she would never have loved the moor
didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand
an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts
they met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac’d together
when these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion
but sir be you ruled by me
i have brought you from venice
for the command i’ll lay’t upon you
i’ll not be far from you
do you find some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favourably minister
sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his truncheon may strike at you provoke him that he may for even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio
so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity
i will do this if i can bring it to any opportunity
meet me by and by at the citadel i must fetch his necessaries ashore
that cassio loves her i do well believe it that she loves him ’tis apt and of great credit the moor howbeit that i endure him not is of a constant loving noble nature and i dare think he’ll prove to desdemona a most dear husband
now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap’d into my seat
the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even’d with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgement cannot cure
which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putting on i’ll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my night cap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregiously an ass and practicing upon his peace and quiet even to madness
knavery’s plain face is never seen till us’d
enter othello’s herald with a proclamation
it is othello’s pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addition leads him
for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed
all offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven
heaven bless the isle of cyprus and our noble general othello
enter othello desdemona cassio and attendants
good michael look you to the guard tonight
let’s teach ourselves that honourable stop not to outsport discretion
iago hath direction what to do
but notwithstanding with my personal eye will i look to’t
tomorrow with your earliest let me have speech with you
to desdemona come my dear love the purchase made the fruits are to ensue that profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you — good night
exeunt othello desdemona and attendants enter iago
’tis not yet ten o’ th’ clock
our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona who let us not therefore blame he hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for jove
and i’ll warrant her full of game
indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature
methinks it sounds a parley to provocation
an inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
and when she speaks is it not an alarm to love
come lieutenant i have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello
i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking
i could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment
o they are our friends but one cup i’ll drink for you
i have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here i am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more
i pray you call them in
i’ll do’t but it dislikes me
if i can fasten but one cup upon him with that which he hath drunk tonight already he’ll be as full of quarrel and offence as my young mistress’ dog
now my sick fool roderigo whom love hath turn’d almost the wrong side out to desdemona hath tonight carous’d potations pottle deep and he’s to watch three lads of cyprus noble swelling spirits that hold their honours in a wary distance the very elements of this warlike isle have i tonight fluster’d with flowing cups and they watch too
now ’mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle
but here they come if consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely both with wind and stream
enter cassio montano and gentlemen followed by servant with wine
’fore god they have given me a rouse already
good faith a little one not past a pint as i am a soldier
sings and let me the cannikin clink clink and let me the cannikin clink clink a soldier’s a man o man’s life’s but a span why then let a soldier drink some wine boys
i learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander —drink ho —are nothing to your english
is your englishman so expert in his drinking
why he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your almain he gives your hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled
to the health of our general
i am for it lieutenant and i’ll do you justice
sings king stephen was a worthy peer his breeches cost him but a crown he held them sixpence all too dear with that he call’d the tailor lown
he was a wight of high renown and thou art but of low degree ’tis pride that pulls the country down then take thine auld cloak about thee some wine ho
’fore god this is a more exquisite song than the other
no for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things
well god’s above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
for mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality i hope to be saved
and so do i too lieutenant
ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient
let’s have no more of this let’s to our affairs
gentlemen let’s look to our business
do not think gentlemen i am drunk
this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left
i can stand well enough and i speak well enough
you must not think then that i am drunk
you see this fellow that is gone before he is a soldier fit to stand by cæsar and give direction and do but see his vice ’tis to his virtue a just equinox the one as long as th’ other
i fear the trust othello puts him in on some odd time of his infirmity will shake this island
’tis evermore the prologue to his sleep he’ll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle
it were well the general were put in mind of it
perhaps he sees it not or his good nature prizes the virtue that appears in cassio and looks not on his evils is not this true
aside to him how now roderigo
i pray you after the lieutenant go
and ’tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity it were an honest action to say so to the moor
not i for this fair island
i do love cassio well and would do much to cure him of this evil
help ” enter cassio driving in roderigo
a knave teach me my duty
i’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle
nay good lieutenant i pray you sir hold your hand
let me go sir or i’ll knock you o’er the mazard
aside to roderigo away i say
go out and cry a mutiny
exit roderigo nay good lieutenant god’s will gentlemen
help ho —lieutenant —sir —montano —sir — help masters
a bell rings who’s that which rings the bell —diablo ho
god’s will lieutenant hold you will be sham’d forever
zounds i bleed still i am hurt to the death
lieutenant —sir —montano —gentlemen — have you forgot all place of sense and duty
the general speaks to you hold hold for shame
are we turn’d turks and to ourselves do that which heaven hath forbid the ottomites
for christian shame put by this barbarous brawl he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle from her propriety
honest iago that looks dead with grieving speak who began this
on thy love i charge thee
friends all but now even now in quarter and in terms like bride and groom devesting them for bed and then but now as if some planet had unwitted men swords out and tilting one at other’s breast in opposition bloody
i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it
how comes it michael you are thus forgot
i pray you pardon me i cannot speak
worthy montano you were wont be civil
the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure what’s the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night brawler
worthy othello i am hurt to danger
your officer iago can inform you while i spare speech which something now offends me of all that i do know nor know i aught by me that’s said or done amiss this night unless self charity be sometimes a vice and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us
now by heaven my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion having my best judgement collied assays to lead the way
zounds if i stir or do but lift this arm the best of you shall sink in my rebuke
give me to know how this foul rout began who set it on and he that is approv’d in this offence though he had twinn’d with me both at a birth shall lose me
in a town of war yet wild the people’s hearts brimful of fear to manage private and domestic quarrel in night and on the court and guard of safety
if partially affin’d or leagu’d in office thou dost deliver more or less than truth thou art no soldier
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio
yet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him
thus it is general montano and myself being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for help and cassio following him with determin’d sword to execute upon him
sir this gentleman steps in to cassio and entreats his pause
myself the crying fellow did pursue lest by his clamour as it so fell out the town might fall in fright he swift of foot outran my purpose and i return’d the rather for that i heard the clink and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till tonight i ne’er might say before
when i came back for this was brief i found them close together at blow and thrust even as again they were when you yourself did part them
more of this matter cannot i report
but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i believe receiv’d from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass
i know iago thy honesty and love doth mince this matter making it light to cassio
cassio i love thee but never more be officer of mine
look if my gentle love be not rais’d up
all’s well now sweeting come away to bed
sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
montano is led off iago look with care about the town and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
come desdemona ’tis the soldiers’ life to have their balmy slumbers wak’d with strife
exeunt all but iago and cassio iago
o i have lost my reputation
i have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial
as i am an honest man i thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation
reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving
you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser
what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he’s yours
i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer
and discourse fustian with one’s own shadow
o thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil
what was he that you followed with your sword
what had he done to you
i remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore
o god that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains
that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
why but you are now well enough how came you thus recovered
it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath
one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself
come you are too severe a moraler
as the time the place and the condition of this country stands i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard
had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all
to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast
every inordinate cup is unbless’d and the ingredient is a devil
come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used
and good lieutenant i think you think i love you
i have well approved it sir —i drunk
you or any man living may be drunk at a time man
i’ll tell you what you shall do
our general’s wife is now the general i may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces
importune her help to put you in your place again
she is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested
this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here
good night lieutenant i must to the watch
and what’s he then that says i play the villain
when this advice is free i give and honest probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again
for ’tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit
she’s fram’d as fruitful as the free elements
and then for her to win the moor were’t to renounce his baptism all seals and symbols of redeemed sin his soul is so enfetter’d to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function
how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good
when devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now for whiles this honest fool plies desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him pleads strongly to the moor i’ll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeals him for her body’s lust and by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor
so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all
i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry
my money is almost spent i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgelled and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice
how poor are they that have not patience
what wound did ever heal but by degrees
thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depends on dilatory time
cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashier’d cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
by the mass ’tis morning pleasure and action make the hours seem short
retire thee go where thou art billeted
away i say thou shalt know more hereafter
exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife must move for cassio to her mistress
i’ll set her on myself the while to draw the moor apart and bring him jump when he may cassio find soliciting his wife
dull not device by coldness and delay
exit act iii scene i cyprus
masters play here i will content your pains something that’s brief and bid “good morrow general ” music enter clown
why masters have your instruments been in naples that they speak i’ the nose thus
are these i pray you wind instruments
marry sir by many a wind instrument that i know
but masters here’s money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for love’s sake to make no more noise with it
if you have any music that may not be heard to’t again
but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care
then put up your pipes in your bag for i’ll away
dost thou hear mine honest friend
no i hear not your honest friend
there’s a poor piece of gold for thee if the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring tell her there’s one cassio entreats her a little favour of speech
she is stirring sir if she will stir hither i shall seem to notify unto her
you have not been a bed then
the day had broke before we parted
i have made bold iago to send in to your wife
my suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access
i’ll send her to you presently and i’ll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way that your converse and business may be more free
exit iago i never knew a florentine more kind and honest
good morrow good lieutenant i am sorry for your displeasure but all will sure be well
the general and his wife are talking of it and she speaks for you stoutly the moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again
yet i beseech you if you think fit or that it may be done give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone
i will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely
i am much bound to you
these letters give iago to the pilot and by him do my duties to the senate
that done i will be walking on the works repair there to me
well my good lord i’ll do’t
this fortification gentlemen shall we see’t
be thou assured good cassio i will do all my abilities in thy behalf
i warrant it grieves my husband as if the cause were his
do not doubt cassio but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were
bounteous madam whatever shall become of michael cassio he’s never anything but your true servant
you have known him long and be you well assur’d he shall in strangeness stand no farther off than in a politic distance
ay but lady that policy may either last so long or feed upon such nice and waterish diet or breed itself so out of circumstance that i being absent and my place supplied my general will forget my love and service
before emilia here i give thee warrant of thy place
assure thee if i do vow a friendship i’ll perform it to the last article
my lord shall never rest i’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience his bed shall seem a school his board a shrift i’ll intermingle everything he does with cassio’s suit
therefore be merry cassio for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away
why stay and hear me speak
i am very ill at ease unfit for mine own purposes
nothing my lord or if—i know not what
was not that cassio parted from my wife
no sure i cannot think it that he would steal away so guilty like seeing you coming
i have been talking with a suitor here a man that languishes in your displeasure
good my lord if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take for if he be not one that truly loves you that errs in ignorance and not in cunning i have no judgement in an honest face
ay sooth so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him
not now sweet desdemon some other time
i shall not dine at home i meet the captains at the citadel
why then tomorrow night or tuesday morn on tuesday noon or night on wednesday morn
i prithee name the time but let it not exceed three days
in faith he’s penitent and yet his trespass in our common reason save that they say the wars must make examples out of their best is not almost a fault to incur a private check
tell me othello i wonder in my soul what you would ask me that i should deny or stand so mammering on
michael cassio that came a wooing with you and so many a time when i have spoke of you dispraisingly hath ta’en your part to have so much to do to bring him in
trust me i could do much
let him come when he will i will deny thee nothing
why this is not a boon ’tis as i should entreat you wear your gloves or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person nay when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted
whereon i do beseech thee grant me this to leave me but a little to myself
be as your fancies teach you
whate’er you be i am obedient
perdition catch my soul but i do love thee
and when i love thee not chaos is come again
did michael cassio when you woo’d my lady know of your love
he did from first to last
but for a satisfaction of my thought
i did not think he had been acquainted with her
o yes and went between us very oft
my lord for aught i know
by heaven he echoes me as if there were some monster in his thought too hideous to be shown
i heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that when cassio left my wife
and when i told thee he was of my counsel in my whole course of wooing thou criedst “indeed ” and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit if thou dost love me show me thy thought
my lord you know i love you
i think thou dost and for i know thou’rt full of love and honesty and weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom but in a man that’s just they’re close dilations working from the heart that passion cannot rule
for michael cassio i dare be sworn i think that he is honest
men should be what they seem or those that be not would they might seem none
certain men should be what they seem
why then i think cassio’s an honest man
nay yet there’s more in this i prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words
though i am bound to every act of duty i am not bound to that all slaves are free to
why say they are vile and false as where’s that palace whereinto foul things sometimes intrude not
who has a breast so pure but some uncleanly apprehensions keep leets and law days and in session sit with meditations lawful
thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but think’st him wrong’d and mak’st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts
i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guess as i confess it is my nature’s plague to spy into abuses and of my jealousy shapes faults that are not —that your wisdom from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble out of his scattering and unsure observance
it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom to let you know my thoughts
good name in man and woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls
who steals my purse steals trash
’tis something nothing ’twas mine ’tis his and has been slave to thousands
but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed
by heaven i’ll know thy thoughts
you cannot if my heart were in your hand nor shall not whilst ’tis in my custody
o beware my lord of jealousy it is the green ey’d monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on
that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his wronger but o what damned minutes tells he o’er who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
poor and content is rich and rich enough but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor
good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy
think’st thou i’d make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions
to be once in doubt is once to be resolv’d exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsufflicate and blown surmises matching thy inference
’tis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are more virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me
no iago i’ll see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy
i am glad of it for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit therefore as i am bound receive it from me
i speak not yet of proof
look to your wife observe her well with cassio wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
i would not have your free and noble nature out of self bounty be abus’d
i know our country disposition well in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands
their best conscience is not to leave undone but keep unknown
she did deceive her father marrying you and when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks she loved them most
she that so young could give out such a seeming to seal her father’s eyes up close as oak he thought ’twas witchcraft
but i am much to blame
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you
i am bound to thee for ever
i see this hath a little dash’d your spirits
not a jot not a jot
trust me i fear it has
i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love
but i do see you’re mov’d
i am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion
should you do so my lord my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aim’d not
my lord i see you’re mov’d
i do not think but desdemona’s honest
and long live you to think so
and yet how nature erring from itself— iago
as to be bold with you not to affect many proposed matches of her own clime complexion and degree whereto we see in all things nature tends foh
one may smell in such a will most rank foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
but pardon me i do not in position distinctly speak of her though i may fear her will recoiling to her better judgement may fall to match you with her country forms and happily repent
farewell farewell if more thou dost perceive let me know more set on thy wife to observe
going my lord i take my leave
this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
returning my lord i would i might entreat your honour to scan this thing no further
leave it to time though it be fit that cassio have his place for sure he fills it up with great ability yet if you please to hold him off awhile you shall by that perceive him and his means
note if your lady strain his entertainment with any strong or vehement importunity much will be seen in that
in the meantime let me be thought too busy in my fears as worthy cause i have to fear i am and hold her free i do beseech your honour
i once more take my leave
this fellow’s of exceeding honesty and knows all qualities with a learned spirit of human dealings
if i do prove her haggard though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings i’d whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune
haply for i am black and have not those soft parts of conversation that chamberers have or for i am declin’d into the vale of years —yet that’s not much— she’s gone i am abus’d and my relief must be to loathe her
o curse of marriage that we can call these delicate creatures ours and not their appetites
i had rather be a toad and live upon the vapour of a dungeon than keep a corner in the thing i love for others’ uses
yet ’tis the plague of great ones prerogativ’d are they less than the base ’tis destiny unshunnable like death even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken
if she be false o then heaven mocks itself
your dinner and the generous islanders by you invited do attend your presence
why do you speak so faintly
i have a pain upon my forehead here
faith that’s with watching ’twill away again let me but bind it hard within this hour it will be well
your napkin is too little he puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it let it alone
come i’ll go in with you
i am very sorry that you are not well
i am glad i have found this napkin this was her first remembrance from the moor
my wayward husband hath a hundred times woo’d me to steal it
but she so loves the token for he conjur’d her she should ever keep it that she reserves it evermore about her to kiss and talk to
i’ll have the work ta’en out and give’t iago
what he will do with it heaven knows not i i nothing but to please his fantasy
i have a thing for you
it is a common thing— emilia
what will you give me now for that same handkerchief
why that the moor first gave to desdemona that which so often you did bid me steal
no faith she let it drop by negligence and to the advantage i being here took ’t up
a good wench give it me
what will you do with’t that you have been so earnest to have me filch it
snatching it why what’s that to you
if it be not for some purpose of import give ’t me again
poor lady she’ll run mad when she shall lack it
be not acknown on’t i have use for it
exit emilia i will in cassio’s lodging lose this napkin and let him find it
trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ
the moor already changes with my poison dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulphur
not poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou ow’dst yesterday
thou hast set me on the rack
i swear ’tis better to be much abus’d than but to know’t a little
what sense had i of her stol’n hours of lust
i saw’t not thought it not it harm’d not me
i slept the next night well was free and merry i found not cassio’s kisses on her lips
he that is robb’d not wanting what is stol’n let him not know’t and he’s not robb’d at all
i am sorry to hear this
i had been happy if the general camp pioners and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known
o now for ever farewell the tranquil mind
farewell the plumed troops and the big wars that make ambition virtue
o farewell farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
and o you mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal jove’s dread clamours counterfeit farewell
villain be sure thou prove my love a whore be sure of it
give me the ocular proof or by the worth of man’s eternal soul thou hadst been better have been born a dog than answer my wak’d wrath
make me to see’t or at the least so prove it that the probation bear no hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
if thou dost slander her and torture me never pray more
abandon all remorse on horror’s head horrors accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amaz’d for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that
have you a soul or sense
take mine office —o wretched fool that liv’st to make thine honesty a vice
take note take note o world to be direct and honest is not safe
i thank you for this profit and from hence i’ll love no friend sith love breeds such offence
i should be wise for honesty’s a fool and loses that it works for
by the world i think my wife be honest and think she is not
i think that thou art just and think thou art not
i’ll have some proof her name that was as fresh as dian’s visage is now begrim’d and black as mine own face
if there be cords or knives poison or fire or suffocating streams i’ll not endure ’t
i see sir you are eaten up with passion
i do repent me that i put it to you
would you the supervisor grossly gape on behold her topp’d
it were a tedious difficulty i think to bring them to that prospect
damn them then if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own
it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys as salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk
but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction you may have’t
give me a living reason she’s disloyal
i do not like the office but sith i am enter’d in this cause so far prick’d to ’t by foolish honesty and love i will go on
i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleep
there are a kind of men so loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
one of this kind is cassio in sleep i heard him say “sweet desdemona let us be wary let us hide our loves ” and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry “o sweet creature ” and then kiss me hard as if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips then laid his leg over my thigh and sigh’d and kiss’d and then cried “cursed fate that gave thee to the moor ” othello
nay this was but his dream
but this denoted a foregone conclusion
’tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
and this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly
i’ll tear her all to pieces
yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet
tell me but this have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand
i gave her such a one ’twas my first gift
i know not that but such a handkerchief i am sure it was your wife’s did i today see cassio wipe his beard with
if it be that — iago
if it be that or any that was hers it speaks against her with the other proofs
o that the slave had forty thousand lives
one is too poor too weak for my revenge
now do i see ’tis true
look here iago all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven
arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell
yield up o love thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate
swell bosom with thy fraught for ’tis of aspics’ tongues
like to the pontic sea whose icy current and compulsive course ne’er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on to the propontic and the hellespont even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace shall ne’er look back ne’er ebb to humble love till that a capable and wide revenge swallow them up
now by yond marble heaven in the due reverence of a sacred vow kneels i here engage my words
kneels witness you ever burning lights above you elements that clip us round about witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit hands heart to wrong’d othello’s service
let him command and to obey shall be in me remorse what bloody business ever
i greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous and will upon the instant put thee to ’t
within these three days let me hear thee say that cassio’s not alive
come go with me apart i will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil
i am your own for ever
do you know sirrah where lieutenant cassio lies
i dare not say he lies anywhere
he’s a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing
to tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie
can anything be made of this
i know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat
can you inquire him out and be edified by report
i will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer
seek him bid him come hither
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
to do this is within the compass of man’s wit and therefore i will attempt the doing it
where should i lose that handkerchief emilia
believe me i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes
and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are it were enough to put him to ill thinking
i think the sun where he was born drew all such humours from him
i will not leave him now till cassio be call’d to him
how is’t with you my lord
this hand is moist my lady
it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow
this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty fasting and prayer much castigation exercise devout for here’s a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels
’tis a good hand a frank one
you may indeed say so for ’twas that hand that gave away my heart
the hearts of old gave hands but our new heraldry is hands not hearts
i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
i have it not about me
that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give
she was a charmer and could almost read the thoughts of people
she told her while she kept it ’twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love
but if she lost it or made a gift of it my father’s eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies she dying gave it me and bid me when my fate would have me wive to give it her
i did so and take heed on’t make it a darling like your precious eye
to lose’t or give’t away were such perdition as nothing else could match
there’s magic in the web of it
a sibyl that had number’d in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses in her prophetic fury sew’d the work the worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserv’d of maiden’s hearts
most veritable therefore look to ’t well
then would to god that i had never seen ’t
why do you speak so startingly and rash
speak is it out of the way
it is not lost but what and if it were
i say it is not lost
why so i can sir but i will not now
this is a trick to put me from my suit
pray you let cassio be receiv’d again
you’ll never meet a more sufficient man
i pray talk me of cassio
a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love shar’d dangers with you — othello
in sooth you are to blame
sure there’s some wonder in this handkerchief i am most unhappy in the loss of it
’tis not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomachs and we all but food they eat us hungerly and when they are full they belch us
look you cassio and my husband
there is no other way ’tis she must do ’t and lo the happiness
how now good cassio what’s the news with you
madam my former suit i do beseech you that by your virtuous means i may again exist and be a member of his love whom i with all the office of my heart entirely honour
if my offence be of such mortal kind that nor my service past nor present sorrows nor purpos’d merit in futurity can ransom me into his love again but to know so must be my benefit so shall i clothe me in a forc’d content and shut myself up in some other course to fortune’s alms
alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alter’d
so help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech
what i can do i will and more i will than for myself i dare
he went hence but now and certainly in strange unquietness
i have seen the cannon when it hath blown his ranks into the air and like the devil from his very arm puff’d his own brother and can he be angry
there’s matter in’t indeed if he be angry
exit iago something sure of state either from venice or some unhatch’d practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases men’s natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object
for let our finger ache and it indues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain
nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal
beshrew me much emilia i was unhandsome warrior as i am arraigning his unkindness with my soul but now i find i had suborn’d the witness and he’s indicted falsely
pray heaven it be state matters as you think and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you
alas the day i never gave him cause
but jealous souls will not be answer’d so they are not ever jealous for the cause but jealous for they are jealous ’tis a monster begot upon itself born on itself
heaven keep that monster from othello’s mind
cassio walk hereabout if i do find him fit i’ll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost
exeunt desdemona and emilia enter bianca
how is it with you my most fair bianca
i’ faith sweet love i was coming to your house
and i was going to your lodging cassio
eight score eight hours and lovers’ absent hours more tedious than the dial eight score times
i have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d but i shall in a more continuate time strike off this score of absence
sweet bianca giving her desdemona’s handkerchief take me this work out
this is some token from a newer friend
to the felt absence now i feel a cause
throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth from whence you have them
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress some remembrance
i found it in my chamber
ere it be demanded as like enough it will i’d have it copied
take it and do ’t and leave me for this time
i do attend here on the general and think it no addition nor my wish to have him see me woman’d
not that i love you not
but that you do not love me
i pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night
’tis but a little way that i can bring you for i attend here
’tis very good i must be circumstanc’d
exeunt act iv scene i cyprus
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more not meaning any harm
naked in bed iago and not mean harm
it is hypocrisy against the devil they that mean virtuously and yet do so the devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
so they do nothing ’tis a venial slip
but if i give my wife a handkerchief— othello
why then ’tis hers my lord and being hers she may i think bestow’t on any man
she is protectress of her honour too
her honour is an essence that’s not seen they have it very oft that have it not but for the handkerchief— othello
by heaven i would most gladly have forgot it
thou said’st o it comes o’er my memory as doth the raven o’er the infected house boding to all he had my handkerchief
what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong
or heard him say as knaves be such abroad who having by their own importunate suit or voluntary dotage of some mistress convinced or supplied them cannot choose but they must blab
he hath my lord but be you well assur’d no more than he’ll unswear
faith that he did—i know not what he did
with her on her what you will
lie on her —we say lie on her when they belie her —lie with her
to confess and be hanged for his labour
first to be hanged and then to confess
nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction
it is not words that shake me thus
is’t possible —confess —handkerchief —o devil — falls in a trance iago
thus credulous fools are caught and many worthy and chaste dames even thus all guiltless meet reproach
my lord is fallen into an epilepsy
no forbear the lethargy must have his quiet course
if not he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness
look he stirs do you withdraw yourself a little while he will recover straight
when he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you
exit cassio how is it general
have you not hurt your head
would you would bear your fortune like a man
a horned man’s a monster and a beast
there’s many a beast then in a populous city and many a civil monster
think every bearded fellow that’s but yok’d may draw with you
there’s millions now alive that nightly lie in those unproper beds which they dare swear peculiar your case is better
o ’tis the spite of hell the fiend’s arch mock to lip a wanton in a secure couch and to suppose her chaste
no let me know and knowing what i am i know what she shall be
o thou art wise ’tis certain
stand you awhile apart confine yourself but in a patient list
whilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief a passion most unsuiting such a man cassio came hither
i shifted him away and laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy bade him anon return and here speak with me the which he promis’d
do but encave yourself and mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns that dwell in every region of his face for i will make him tell the tale anew where how how oft how long ago and when he hath and is again to cope your wife i say but mark his gesture
marry patience or i shall say you are all in all in spleen and nothing of a man
i will be found most cunning in my patience but —dost thou hear —most bloody
but yet keep time in all
othello withdraws now will i question cassio of bianca a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes it is a creature that dotes on cassio as ’tis the strumpet’s plague to beguile many and be beguil’d by one
he when he hears of her cannot refrain from the excess of laughter
as he shall smile othello shall go mad and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio’s smiles gestures and light behaviour quite in the wrong
the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me
ply desdemona well and you are sure on’t
speaking lower now if this suit lay in bianca’s power how quickly should you speed
aside look how he laughs already
i never knew a woman love man so
i think i’ faith she loves me
aside now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
now he importunes him to tell it o’er
go to well said well said
she gives it out that you shall marry her
i prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
i am a very villain else
this is the monkey’s own giving out
she is persuaded i will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise
she haunts me in every place
i was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain venetians and thither comes the bauble and falls thus about my neck
crying “o dear cassio ” as it were his gesture imports it
so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber
o i see that nose of yours but not that dog i shall throw it to
well i must leave her company
what do you mean by this haunting of me
let the devil and his dam haunt you
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
i was a fine fool to take it
i must take out the work
a likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there
this is some minx’s token and i must take out the work
there give it your hobby horse
wheresoever you had it i’ll take out no work on’t
by heaven that should be my handkerchief
if you’ll come to supper tonight you may
if you will not come when you are next prepared for
faith i must she’ll rail in the street else
well i may chance to see you for i would very fain speak with you
coming forward how shall i murder him iago
did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
and did you see the handkerchief
yours by this hand and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife
she gave it him and he hath given it his whore
i would have him nine years a killing
a fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman
ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not live
no my heart is turned to stone i strike it and it hurts my hand
o the world hath not a sweeter creature
she might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks
hang her i do but say what she is
so delicate with her needle an admirable musician
o she will sing the savageness out of a bear
of so high and plenteous wit and invention
she’s the worse for all this
o a thousand a thousand times and then of so gentle a condition
but yet the pity of it iago
o iago the pity of it iago
if you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody
i will chop her into messes
get me some poison iago this night
i’ll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again
do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated
and for cassio let me be his undertaker
you shall hear more by midnight
a trumpet within what trumpet is that same
’tis lodovico come from the duke
see your wife is with him
the duke and senators of venice greet you
i kiss the instrument of their pleasures
opens the packet and reads desdemona
and what’s the news good cousin lodovico
i am very glad to see you signior
cousin there’s fall’n between him and my lord an unkind breach but you shall make all well
reads “this fail you not to do as you will—” lodovico
he did not call he’s busy in the paper
is there division ’twixt my lord and cassio
i would do much to atone them for the love i bear to cassio
may be the letter mov’d him for as i think they do command him home deputing cassio in his government
trust me i am glad on’t
i am glad to see you mad
my lord this would not be believ’d in venice though i should swear i saw’t ’tis very much
if that the earth could teem with woman’s tears each drop she falls would prove a crocodile
i will not stay to offend you
i do beseech your lordship call her back
what would you with her sir
ay you did wish that i would make her turn
sir she can turn and turn and yet go on and turn again
and she can weep sir weep and she’s obedient as you say obedient very obedient
concerning this sir —o well painted passion
i am commanded home —get you away i’ll send for you anon —sir i obey the mandate and will return to venice —hence avaunt
exit desdemona cassio shall have my place
and sir tonight i do entreat that we may sup together
you are welcome sir to cyprus
is this the noble moor whom our full senate call all in all sufficient
is this the nature whom passion could not shake
whose solid virtue the shot of accident nor dart of chance could neither graze nor pierce
is he not light of brain
i may not breathe my censure what he might be
if what he might he is not i would to heaven he were
faith that was not so well yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst
or did the letters work upon his blood and new create this fault
it is not honesty in me to speak what i have seen and known
you shall observe him and his own courses will denote him so that i may save my speech do but go after and mark how he continues
i am sorry that i am deceiv’d in him
nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
yes you have seen cassio and she together
but then i saw no harm and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them
nor send you out o’ the way
to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
i durst my lord to wager she is honest lay down my soul at stake if you think other remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
if any wretch have put this in your head let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse for if she be not honest chaste and true there’s no man happy
the purest of their wives is foul as slander
yet she’s a simple bawd that cannot say as much
this is a subtle whore a closet lock and key of villainous secrets
and yet she’ll kneel and pray
i have seen her do ’t
my lord what is your will
to emilia some of your function mistress leave procreants alone and shut the door
cough or cry hem if anybody come
upon my knees what doth your speech import
i understand a fury in your words but not the words
your wife my lord your true and loyal wife
come swear it damn thyself lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves should fear to seize thee
heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
alas the heavy day why do you weep
am i the motive of these tears my lord
if haply you my father do suspect an instrument of this your calling back lay not your blame on me
if you have lost him why i have lost him too
had it pleas’d heaven to try me with affliction had they rain’d all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head steep’d me in poverty to the very lips given to captivity me and my utmost hopes i should have found in some place of my soul a drop of patience
but alas to make me a fixed figure for the time of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at
yet could i bear that too well very well but there where i have garner’d up my heart where either i must live or bear no life the fountain from the which my current runs or else dries up to be discarded thence or keep it as a cistern for foul toads to knot and gender in —turn thy complexion there patience thou young and rose lipp’d cherubin ay there look grim as hell
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest
o ay as summer flies are in the shambles that quicken even with blowing
o thou weed who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet that the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne’er been born
alas what ignorant sin have i committed
was this fair paper this most goodly book made to write “whore” upon
i should make very forges of my cheeks that would to cinders burn up modesty did i but speak thy deeds
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets is hush’d within the hollow mine of earth and will not hear it
by heaven you do me wrong
no as i am a christian if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet i am none
no as i shall be sav’d
i took you for that cunning whore of venice that married with othello —you mistress enter emilia
that have the office opposite to saint peter and keeps the gate of hell
we have done our course there’s money for your pains
i pray you turn the key and keep our counsel
alas what does this gentleman conceive
how do you my good lady
good madam what’s the matter with my lord
he that is yours sweet lady
do not talk to me emilia i cannot weep nor answer have i none but what should go by water
prithee tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember and call thy husband hither
’tis meet i should be us’d so very meet
how have i been behav’d that he might stick the small’st opinion on my least misuse
those that do teach young babes do it with gentle means and easy tasks
he might have chid me so for in good faith i am a child to chiding
alas iago my lord hath so bewhor’d her thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her as true hearts cannot bear
such as she says my lord did say i was
he call’d her whore a beggar in his drink could not have laid such terms upon his callet
i am sure i am none such
do not weep do not weep alas the day
hath she forsook so many noble matches her father and her country and her friends to be call’d whore
would it not make one weep
how comes this trick upon him
i will be hang’d if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devis’d this slander
fie there is no such man
if any such there be heaven pardon him
a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones
why should he call her whore
the moor’s abused by some most villainous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
o heaven that such companions thou’dst unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west
some such squire he was that turn’d your wit the seamy side without and made you to suspect me with the moor
alas iago what shall i do to win my lord again
for by this light of heaven i know not how i lost him
if e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love either in discourse of thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delighted them in any other form or that i do not yet and ever did and ever will though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me
unkindness may do much and his unkindness may defeat my life but never taint my love
i cannot say “whore ” it does abhor me now i speak the word to do the act that might the addition earn not the world’s mass of vanity could make me
the business of the state does him offence and he does chide with you
if ’twere no other — iago
trumpets within hark how these instruments summon to supper
the messengers of venice stay the meat
exeunt desdemona and emilia enter roderigo
i do not find that thou dealest justly with me
every day thou daffest me with some device iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope
i will indeed no longer endure it
nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what already i have foolishly suffered
faith i have heard too much for your words and performances are no kin together
i have wasted myself out of my means
the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but i find none
very well go to i cannot go to man nor ’tis not very well
nay i say ’tis very scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it
i tell you ’tis not very well
i will make myself known to desdemona
if she will return me my jewels i will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation
if not assure yourself i will seek satisfaction of you
ay and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing
why now i see there’s mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before
thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair
i grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement
but roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which i have greater reason to believe now than ever —i mean purpose courage and valour —this night show it
if thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life
is it within reason and compass
sir there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello’s place
why then othello and desdemona return again to venice
o no he goes into mauritania and takes away with him the fair desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of cassio
how do you mean “removing” of him
why by making him uncapable of othello’s place knocking out his brains
and that you would have me to do
ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
he sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will i go to him
he knows not yet of his honourable fortune
if you will watch his going thence which i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your pleasure i will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us
come stand not amazed at it but go along with me
i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him
it is now high supper time and the night grows to waste
i will hear further reason for this
enter othello lodovico desdemona emilia and attendants
i do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
o pardon me ’twill do me good to walk
will you walk sir — o desdemona — desdemona
get you to bed on th’ instant i will be return’d forthwith
exeunt othello lodovico and attendants emilia
he looks gentler than he did
he says he will return incontinent he hath commanded me to go to bed and bade me to dismiss you
therefore good emilia give me my nightly wearing and adieu
we must not now displease him
i would you had never seen him
my love doth so approve him that even his stubbornness his checks his frowns — prithee unpin me —have grace and favour in them
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
good faith how foolish are our minds
if i do die before thee prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets
my mother had a maid call’d barbary she was in love and he she lov’d prov’d mad and did forsake her
she had a song of “willow” an old thing ’twas but it express’d her fortune and she died singing it
that song tonight will not go from my mind
i have much to do but to go hang my head all at one side and sing it like poor barbary
shall i go fetch your night gown
this lodovico is a proper man
i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot to palestine for a touch of his nether lip
singing the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree sing all a green willow
her hand on her bosom her head on her knee sing willow willow willow
the fresh streams ran by her and murmur’d her moans sing willow willow willow her salt tears fell from her and soften’d the stones — lay by these — sings sing willow willow willow prithee hie thee
sings sing all a green willow must be my garland
let nobody blame him his scorn i approve — nay that’s not next
sings i call’d my love false love but what said he then
sing willow willow willow if i court mo women you’ll couch with mo men so get thee gone good night
mine eyes do itch doth that bode weeping
i have heard it said so
dost thou in conscience think —tell me emilia — that there be women do abuse their husbands in such gross kind
there be some such no question
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
nor i neither by this heavenly light i might do’t as well i’ the dark
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
it is a great price for a small vice
in troth i think thou wouldst not
in troth i think i should and undo’t when i had done
marry i would not do such a thing for a joint ring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world—why who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch
i should venture purgatory for ’t
beshrew me if i would do such a wrong for the whole world
why the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world and having the world for your labour ’tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right
i do not think there is any such woman
yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for
but i do think it is their husbands’ faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us
or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite
why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge
let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have
what is it that they do when they change us for others
and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have
then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so
heaven me such usage send not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
exeunt act v scene i cyprus
wear thy good rapier bare and put it home
quick quick fear nothing i’ll be at thy elbow
it makes us or it mars us think on that and fix most firm thy resolution
be near at hand i may miscarry in ’t
be bold and take thy stand
retires to a little distance roderigo
i have no great devotion to the deed and yet he hath given me satisfying reasons
i have rubb’d this young quat almost to the sense and he grows angry
now whether he kill cassio or cassio him or each do kill the other every way makes my gain
live roderigo he calls me to a restitution large of gold and jewels that i bobb’d from him as gifts to desdemona
if cassio do remain he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly
and besides the moor may unfold me to him there stand i in much peril
but so i hear him coming
i know his gait ’tis he
rushes out and makes a pass at cassio cassio
that thrust had been mine enemy indeed but that my coat is better than thou know’st
i will make proof of thine
iago rushes from his post cuts cassio behind in the leg and exit cassio
o brave iago honest and just that hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong
thou teachest me —minion your dear lies dead and your unbless’d fate hies
forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted thy bed lust stain’d shall with lust’s blood be spotted
’tis some mischance the cry is very direful
let’s think’t unsafe to come in to the cry without more help
then shall i bleed to death
here’s one comes in his shirt with light and weapons
whose noise is this that cries on murder
did not you hear a cry
this is othello’s ancient as i take it
the same indeed a very valiant fellow
what are you here that cry so grievously
o i am spoil’d undone by villains
i think that one of them is hereabout and cannot make away
to lodovico and gratiano what are you there
come in and give some help
are you of good or evil
as you shall prove us praise us
my leg is cut in two
light gentlemen i’ll bind it with my shirt
o my dear cassio my sweet cassio
cassio may you suspect who they should be that have thus mangled you
i am sorry to find you thus i have been to seek you
so —o for a chair to bear him easily hence
gentlemen all i do suspect this trash to be a party in this injury
come come lend me a light
know we this face or no
alas my friend and my dear countryman roderigo
these bloody accidents must excuse my manners that so neglected you
i am glad to see you
a chair brought in o that’s well said the chair
some good man bear him carefully from hence i’ll fetch the general’s surgeon
to bianca for you mistress save you your labour
he that lies slain here cassio was my dear friend
nor do i know the man
to bianca what look you pale —o bear him out o’ the air
cassio and roderigo are borne off stay you good gentlemen —look you pale mistress
do you perceive the gastness of her eye
nay if you stare we shall hear more anon
i pray you look upon her
nay guiltiness will speak though tongues were out of use
cassio hath here been set on in the dark by roderigo and fellows that are ’scap’d
he’s almost slain and roderigo dead
this is the fruit of whoring
prithee emilia go know of cassio where he supp’d tonight
what do you shake at that
he supp’d at my house but i therefore shake not
i charge you go with me
i am no strumpet but of life as honest as you that thus abuse me
kind gentlemen let’s go see poor cassio dress’d
come mistress you must tell’s another tale
emilia run you to the citadel and tell my lord and lady what hath happ’d
aside this is the night that either makes me or fordoes me quite
desdemona in bed asleep a light burning
it is the cause it is the cause my soul let me not name it to you you chaste stars
yet i’ll not shed her blood nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow and smooth as monumental alabaster
yet she must die else she’ll betray more men
put out the light and then put out the light if i quench thee thou flaming minister i can again thy former light restore should i repent me
but once put out thy light thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature i know not where is that promethean heat that can thy light relume
when i have pluck’d thy rose i cannot give it vital growth again it must needs wither
i’ll smell it on the tree
kissing her o balmy breath that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword
be thus when thou art dead and i will kill thee and love thee after
one more and this the last
so sweet was ne’er so fatal
i must weep but they are cruel tears
this sorrow’s heavenly it strikes where it doth love
will you come to bed my lord
if you bethink yourself of any crime unreconcil’d as yet to heaven and grace solicit for it straight
alack my lord what may you mean by that
well do it and be brief i will walk by
i would not kill thy unprepared spirit no heaven forfend
i would not kill thy soul
then heaven have mercy on me
if you say so i hope you will not kill me
and yet i fear you for you are fatal then when your eyes roll so why i should fear i know not since guiltiness i know not but yet i feel i fear
they are loves i bear to you
ay and for that thou diest
that death’s unnatural that kills for loving
alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
some bloody passion shakes your very frame
these are portents but yet i hope i hope they do not point on me
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee thou gav’st to cassio
no by my life and soul
send for the man and ask him
sweet soul take heed take heed of perjury thou’rt on thy death bed
ay but not yet to die
yes presently therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
for to deny each article with oath cannot remove nor choke the strong conception that i do groan withal
then lord have mercy on me
i never did offend you in my life never lov’d cassio but with such general warranty of heaven as i might love
by heaven i saw my handkerchief in ’s hand
o perjur’d woman thou dost stone my heart and mak’st me call what i intend to do a murder which i thought a sacrifice
honest iago hath ta’en order for ’t
had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all
alas he is betray’d and i undone
weep’st thou for him to my face
o banish me my lord but kill me not
kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
nay if you strive — desdemona
being done there is no pause
but while i say one prayer
i that am cruel am yet merciful i would not have thee linger in thy pain
within o good my lord i would speak a word with you
’tis like she comes to speak of cassio’s death the noise was high —ha
i think she stirs again no
if she come in she’ll sure speak to my wife
methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe should yawn at alteration
within i do beseech you that i may speak with you o good my lord
i had forgot thee o come in emilia
soft by and by let me the curtains draw
what’s the matter with thee now
o my good lord yonder’s foul murders done
it is the very error of the moon she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad
cassio my lord hath kill’d a young venetian call’d roderigo
then murder’s out of tune and sweet revenge grows harsh
o lady speak again sweet desdemona
o who hath done this deed
commend me to my kind lord
why how should she be murder’d
you heard her say herself it was not i emilia
i must needs report the truth
she’s like a liar gone to burning hell
o the more angel she and you the blacker devil
she turn’d to folly and she was a whore
thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
thou art rash as fire to say that she was false o she was heavenly true
cassio did top her ask thy husband else
o i were damn’d beneath all depth in hell but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity
that she was false to wedlock
nay had she been true if heaven would make me such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite i’d not have sold her for it
ay ’twas he that told me first
an honest man he is and hates the slime that sticks on filthy deeds
o mistress villainy hath made mocks with love
my husband say that she was false
he woman i say thy husband dost understand the word
my friend thy husband honest honest iago
if he say so may his pernicious soul rot half a grain a day
she was too fond of her most filthy bargain
do thy worst this deed of thine is no more worthy heaven than thou wast worthy her
thou hast not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt
thou hast done a deed i care not for thy sword i’ll make thee known though i lost twenty lives
the moor hath kill’d my mistress
you have done well that men must lay their murders on your neck
disprove this villain if thou be’st a man
he says thou told’st him that his wife was false
i know thou didst not thou’rt not such a villain
speak for my heart is full
i told him what i thought and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true
but did you ever tell him she was false
you told a lie an odious damned lie upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
i will not charm my tongue i am bound to speak
my mistress here lies murder’d in her bed
and your reports have set the murder on
nay stare not masters it is true indeed
i think upon’t i think i smell’t o villany
i charge you get you home
good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
’tis proper i obey him but not now
perchance iago i will ne’er go home
nay lay thee down and roar for thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent that e’er did lift up eye
i scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp’d
i know this act shows horrible and grim
i am glad thy father’s dead
thy match was mortal to him and pure grief shore his old thread in twain did he live now this sight would make him do a desperate turn yea curse his better angel from his side and fall to reprobance
but yet iago knows that she with cassio hath the act of shame a thousand times committed cassio confess’d it and she did gratify his amorous works with that recognizance and pledge of love which i first gave her i saw it in his hand
it was a handkerchief an antique token my father gave my mother
no i will speak as liberal as the north
let heaven and men and devils let them all all all cry shame against me yet i’ll speak
be wise and get you home
iago offers to stab his wife gratiano
o thou dull moor that handkerchief thou speak’st of i found by fortune and did give my husband for often with a solemn earnestness more than indeed belong’d to such a trifle he begg’d of me to steal it
no alas i found it and i did give’t my husband
by heaven i do not i do not gentlemen
what should such a fool do with so good a wife
othello are there not stones in heaven but what serve for thunder
iago stabs emilia and then runs out gratiano
sure he hath kill’d his wife
o lay me by my mistress’ side
he’s gone but his wife’s kill’d
take you this weapon which i have here recover’d from the moor
come guard the door without let him not pass but kill him rather
i’ll after that same villain for ’tis a damned slave
i am not valiant neither but every puny whipster gets my sword
but why should honour outlive honesty
what did thy song bode lady
i will play the swan and die in music
sings willow willow willow moor she was chaste
she lov’d thee cruel moor so come my soul to bliss as i speak true so speaking as i think i die i die
i have another weapon in this chamber it is a sword of spain the ice brook’s temper
within if thou attempt it it will cost thee dear thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
look in upon me then and speak with me or naked as i am i will assault thee
a better never did itself sustain upon a soldier’s thigh i have seen the day that with this little arm and this good sword i have made my way through more impediments than twenty times your stop
be not afraid though you do see me weapon’d
here is my journey’s end here is my butt and very sea mark of my utmost sail
man but a rush against othello’s breast and he retires
now how dost thou look now
o ill starr’d wench pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven and fiends will snatch at it
whip me ye devils from the possession of this heavenly sight
blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire
enter lodovico montano cassio carried in a chair and officers with iago prisoner
where is this rash and most unfortunate man
i look down towards his feet but that’s a fable
if that thou be’st a devil i cannot kill thee
i bleed sir but not kill’d
i’d have thee live for in my sense ’tis happiness to die
o thou othello that wert once so good fall’n in the practice of a damned slave what shall be said to thee
why anything an honourable murderer if you will
for naught did i in hate but all in honour
this wretch hath part confess’d his villany
did you and he consent in cassio’s death
dear general i never gave you cause
i do believe it and i ask your pardon
will you i pray demand that demi devil why he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body
from this time forth i never will speak word
sir you shall understand what hath befall’n which as i think you know not
here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain roderigo and here another
the one of them imports the death of cassio to be undertook by roderigo
now here’s another discontented paper found in his pocket too and this it seems roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain but that belike iago in the interim came in and satisfied him
how came you cassio by that handkerchief that was my wife’s
i found it in my chamber
and he himself confess’d but even now that there he dropp’d it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire
there is besides in roderigo’s letter how he upbraids iago that he made him brave me upon the watch whereon it came that i was cast
and even but now he spake after long seeming dead iago hurt him iago set him on
you must forsake this room and go with us
your power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus
for this slave if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long it shall be his
you shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state
soft you a word or two before you go
i have done the state some service and they know’t
i pray you in your letters when you shall these unlucky deeds relate speak of me as i am
nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice
then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well of one not easily jealous but being wrought perplex’d in the extreme of one whose hand like the base judean threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe of one whose subdu’d eyes albeit unused to the melting mood drop tears as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gum
and say besides that in aleppo once where a malignant and a turban’d turk beat a venetian and traduc’d the state i took by the throat the circumcised dog and smote him thus
i kiss’d thee ere i kill’d thee
no way but this killing myself to die upon a kiss
this did i fear but thought he had no weapon for he was great of heart
to iago o spartan dog more fell than anguish hunger or the sea look on the tragic loading of this bed
the object poisons sight let it be hid
gratiano keep the house and seize upon the fortunes of the moor for they succeed on you
to you lord governor remains the censure of this hellish villain
the time the place the torture o enforce it
myself will straight aboard and to the state this heavy act with heavy heart relate

dramatis personæ antiochus king of antioch
helicanus escanes two lords of tyre
marina daughter to pericles and thaisa
lords knights gentlemen sailors pirates fishermen and messengers
to sing a song that old was sung from ashes ancient gower is come assuming man’s infirmities to glad your ear and please your eyes
it hath been sung at festivals on ember eves and holy ales and lords and ladies in their lives have read it for restoratives the purchase is to make men glorious et bonum quo antiquius eo melius if you born in these latter times when wit’s more ripe accept my rhymes and that to hear an old man sing may to your wishes pleasure bring i life would wish and that i might waste it for you like taper light
this antioch then antiochus the great built up this city for his chiefest seat the fairest in all syria
i tell you what mine authors say this king unto him took a fere who died and left a female heir so buxom blithe and full of face as heaven had lent her all his grace with whom the father liking took and her to incest did provoke
to entice his own to evil should be done by none but custom what they did begin was with long use account’d no sin
the beauty of this sinful dame made many princes thither frame to seek her as a bedfellow in marriage pleasures playfellow which to prevent he made a law to keep her still and men in awe that whoso ask’d her for his wife his riddle told not lost his life so for her many a wight did die as yon grim looks do testify
what now ensues to the judgement your eye i give my cause who best can justify
enter antiochus prince pericles and followers
young prince of tyre you have at large received the danger of the task you undertake
i have antiochus and with a soul emboldened with the glory of her praise think death no hazard in this enterprise
bring in our daughter clothed like a bride for the embracements even of jove himself at whose conception till lucina reigned nature this dowry gave to glad her presence the senate house of planets all did sit to knit in her their best perfections
see where she comes apparell’d like the spring graces her subjects and her thoughts the king of every virtue gives renown to men
her face the book of praises where is read nothing but curious pleasures as from thence sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath could never be her mild companion
you gods that made me man and sway in love that have inflamed desire in my breast to taste the fruit of yon celestial tree or die in the adventure be my helps as i am son and servant to your will to compass such a boundless happiness
that would be son to great antiochus
before thee stands this fair hesperides with golden fruit but dangerous to be touch’d for death like dragons here affright thee hard her face like heaven enticeth thee to view her countless glory which desert must gain and which without desert because thine eye presumes to reach all the whole heap must die
yon sometimes famous princes like thyself drawn by report adventurous by desire tell thee with speechless tongues and semblance pale that without covering save yon field of stars here they stand martyrs slain in cupid’s wars and with dead cheeks advise thee to desist for going on death’s net whom none resist
antiochus i thank thee who hath taught my frail mortality to know itself and by those fearful objects to prepare this body like to them to what i must for death remember’d should be like a mirror who tells us life’s but breath to trust it error
i’ll make my will then and as sick men do who know the world see heaven but feeling woe gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did so i bequeath a happy peace to you and all good men as every prince should do my riches to the earth from whence they came to the daughter of antiochus but my unspotted fire of love to you
thus ready for the way of life or death i wait the sharpest blow antiochus
scorning advice read the conclusion then which read and not expounded ’tis decreed as these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed
of all ’ssayed yet mayst thou prove prosperous
of all ’ssayed yet i wish thee happiness
pericles like a bold champion i assume the lists nor ask advice of any other thought but faithfulness and courage
he reads the riddle i am no viper yet i feed on mother’s flesh which did me breed
i sought a husband in which labour i found that kindness in a father he’s father son and husband mild i mother wife and yet his child
how they may be and yet in two as you will live resolve it you sharp physic is the last but o you powers that give heaven countless eyes to view men’s acts why cloud they not their sights perpetually if this be true which makes me pale to read it
fair glass of light i loved you and could still takes hold of the hand of the princess were not this glorious casket stored with ill but i must tell you now my thoughts revolt for he’s no man on whom perfections wait that knowing sin within will touch the gate you are a fair viol and your sense the strings who finger’d to make man his lawful music would draw heaven down and all the gods to hearken but being play’d upon before your time hell only danceth at so harsh a chime
good sooth i care not for you
prince pericles touch not upon thy life for that’s an article within our law as dangerous as the rest
your time’s expired either expound now or receive your sentence
great king few love to hear the sins they love to act ’twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it
who has a book of all that monarchs do he’s more secure to keep it shut than shown for vice repeated is like the wandering wind blows dust in others’ eyes to spread itself and yet the end of all is bought thus dear the breath is gone and the sore eyes see clear
to stop the air would hurt them
the blind mole casts copp’d hills towards heaven to tell the earth is throng’d by man’s oppression and the poor worm doth die for’t
kind are earth’s gods in vice their law’s their will and if jove stray who dares say jove doth ill
it is enough you know and it is fit what being more known grows worse to smother it
all love the womb that their first bred then give my tongue like leave to love my head
aside heaven that i had thy head
he has found the meaning but i will gloze with him
though by the tenour of our strict edict your exposition misinterpreting we might proceed to cancel of your days yet hope succeeding from so fair a tree as your fair self doth tune us otherwise forty days longer we do respite you if by which time our secret be undone this mercy shows we’ll joy in such a son and until then your entertain shall be as doth befit our honour and your worth
how courtesy would seem to cover sin when what is done is like an hypocrite the which is good in nothing but in sight
if it be true that i interpret false then were it certain you were not so bad as with foul incest to abuse your soul where now you’re both a father and a son by your untimely claspings with your child which pleasures fits a husband not a father and she an eater of her mother’s flesh by the defiling of her parent’s bed and both like serpents are who though they feed on sweetest flowers yet they poison breed
for wisdom sees those men blush not in actions blacker than the night will ’schew no course to keep them from the light
one sin i know another doth provoke murder’s as near to lust as flame to smoke poison and treason are the hands of sin ay and the targets to put off the shame then lest my life be cropp’d to keep you clear by flight i’ll shun the danger which i fear
he hath found the meaning for which we mean to have his head
he must not live to trumpet forth my infamy nor tell the world antiochus doth sin in such a loathed manner and therefore instantly this prince must die for by his fall my honour must keep high
thaliard you are of our chamber and our mind partakes her private actions to your secrecy and for your faithfulness we will advance you
thaliard behold here’s poison and here’s gold we hate the prince of tyre and thou must kill him it fits thee not to ask the reason why because we bid it
let your breath cool yourself telling your haste
my lord prince pericles is fled
as thou wilt live fly after and like an arrow shot from a well experienced archer hits the mark his eye doth level at so thou ne’er return unless thou say ‘prince pericles is dead ’ thaliard
my lord if i can get him within my pistol’s length i’ll make him sure enough so farewell to your highness
exit thaliard till pericles be dead my heart can lend no succour to my head
to lords without let none disturb us
— why should this change of thoughts the sad companion dull eyed melancholy be my so used a guest as not an hour in the day’s glorious walk or peaceful night the tomb where grief should sleep can breed me quiet
here pleasures court mine eyes and mine eyes shun them and danger which i fear’d is at antioch whose arm seems far too short to hit me here yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits nor yet the other’s distance comfort me
then it is thus the passions of the mind that have their first conception by misdread have after nourishment and life by care and what was first but fear what might be done grows elder now and cares it be not done
and so with me the great antiochus ’gainst whom i am too little to contend since he’s so great can make his will his act will think me speaking though i swear to silence nor boots it me to say i honour him
joy and all comfort in your sacred breast
and keep your mind till you return to us peaceful and comfortable
peace peace and give experience tongue
they do abuse the king that flatter him for flattery is the bellows blows up sin the thing the which is flatter’d but a spark to which that spark gives heat and stronger glowing whereas reproof obedient and in order fits kings as they are men for they may err
when signior sooth here does proclaim peace he flatters you makes war upon your life
prince pardon me or strike me if you please i cannot be much lower than my knees
all leave us else but let your cares o’erlook what shipping and what lading’s in our haven and then return to us
exeunt lords helicanus thou hast moved us what seest thou in our looks
if there be such a dart in princes’ frowns how durst thy tongue move anger to our face
how dares the plants look up to heaven from whence they have their nourishment
thou know’st i have power to take thy life from thee
kneeling i have ground the axe myself do but you strike the blow
sit down thou art no flatterer i thank thee for it and heaven forbid that kings should let their ears hear their faults hid
fit counsellor and servant for a prince who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant what wouldst thou have me do
to bear with patience such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself
thou speak’st like a physician helicanus that ministers a potion unto me that thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself
attend me then i went to antioch where as thou know’st against the face of death i sought the purchase of a glorious beauty from whence an issue i might propagate are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects
her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder the rest — hark in thine ear — as black as incest which by my knowledge found the sinful father seem’d not to strike but smooth but thou know’st this ’tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss
which fear so grew in me i hither fled under the covering of a careful night who seem’d my good protector and being here bethought me what was past what might succeed
drew sleep out of mine eyes blood from my cheeks musings into my mind with thousand doubts how i might stop this tempest ere it came and finding little comfort to relieve them i thought it princely charity to grieve them
well my lord since you have given me leave to speak freely will i speak
antiochus you fear and justly too i think you fear the tyrant who either by public war or private treason will take away your life
therefore my lord go travel for a while till that his rage and anger be forgot or till the destinies do cut his thread of life
your rule direct to any if to me day serves not light more faithful than i’ll be
i do not doubt thy faith but should he wrong my liberties in my absence
we’ll mingle our bloods together in the earth from whence we had our being and our birth
tyre i now look from thee then and to tarsus intend my travel where i’ll hear from thee and by whose letters i’ll dispose myself
the care i had and have of subjects’ good on thee i lay whose wisdom’s strength can bear it
i’ll take thy word for faith not ask thine oath who shuns not to break one will sure crack both but in our orbs we’ll live so round and safe that time of both this truth shall ne’er convince thou show’dst a subject’s shine i a true prince
an ante chamber in the palace
so this is tyre and this the court
here must i kill king pericles and if i do it not i am sure to be hanged at home ’tis dangerous
well i perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that being bid to ask what he would of the king desired he might know none of his secrets now do i see he had some reason for’t for if a king bid a man be a villain he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one
husht here come the lords of tyre
enter helicanus and escanes with other lords of tyre
you shall not need my fellow peers of tyre further to question me of your king’s departure his seal’d commission left in trust with me doth speak sufficiently he’s gone to travel
if further yet you will be satisfied why as it were unlicensed of your loves he would depart i’ll give some light unto you
royal antiochus — on what cause i know not took some displeasure at him at least he judged so and doubting lest that he had err’d or sinn’d to show his sorrow he’d correct himself so puts himself unto the shipman’s toil with whom each minute threatens life or death
aside well i perceive i shall not be hang’d now although i would but since he’s gone the king’s seas must please he ’scaped the land to perish at the sea
peace to the lords of tyre
lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome
from him i come with message unto princely pericles but since my landing i have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels my message must return from whence it came
we have no reason to desire it commended to our master not to us yet ere you shall depart this we desire as friends to antioch we may feast in tyre
a room in the governor’s house
enter cleon the governor of tarsus with dionyza and others
my dionyza shall we rest us here and by relating tales of others’ griefs see if ’twill teach us to forget our own
that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it for who digs hills because they do aspire throws down one mountain to cast up a higher
o my distressed lord even such our griefs are here they’re but felt and seen with mischief’s eyes but like to groves being topp’d they higher rise
o dionyza who wanteth food and will not say he wants it or can conceal his hunger till he famish
our tongues and sorrows do sound deep our woes into the air our eyes do weep till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder that if heaven slumber while their creatures want they may awake their helps to comfort them
i’ll then discourse our woes felt several years and wanting breath to speak help me with tears
this tarsus o’er which i have the government a city on whom plenty held full hand for riches strew’d herself even in the streets whose towers bore heads so high they kiss’d the clouds and strangers ne’er beheld but wonder’d at whose men and dames so jetted and adorn’d like one another’s glass to trim them by their tables were stored full to glad the sight and not so much to feed on as delight all poverty was scorn’d and pride so great the name of help grew odious to repeat
but see what heaven can do
by this our change these mouths who but of late earth sea and air were all too little to content and please although they gave their creatures in abundance as houses are defiled for want of use they are now starved for want of exercise those palates who not yet two summers younger must have inventions to delight the taste would now be glad of bread and beg for it those mothers who to nousle up their babes thought nought too curious are ready now to eat those little darlings whom they loved
so sharp are hunger’s teeth that man and wife draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life here stands a lord and there a lady weeping here many sink yet those which see them fall have scarce strength left to give them burial
our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it
o let those cities that of plenty’s cup and her prosperities so largely taste with their superflous riots hear these tears
the misery of tarsus may be theirs
speak out thy sorrows which thou bring’st in haste for comfort is too far for us to expect
we have descried upon our neighbouring shore a portly sail of ships make hitherward
one sorrow never comes but brings an heir that may succeed as his inheritor and so in ours some neighbouring nation taking advantage of our misery that stuff’d the hollow vessels with their power to beat us down the which are down already and make a conquest of unhappy me whereas no glory’s got to overcome
that’s the least fear for by the semblance of their white flags display’d they bring us peace and come to us as favourers not as foes
thou speak’st like him’s untutor’d to repeat who makes the fairest show means most deceit
but bring they what they will and what they can what need we fear
the ground’s the lowest and we are half way there
go tell their general we attend him here to know for what he comes and whence he comes and what he craves
welcome is peace if he on peace consist if wars we are unable to resist
lord governor for so we hear you are let not our ships and number of our men be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes
we have heard your miseries as far as tyre and seen the desolation of your streets nor come we to add sorrow to your tears but to relieve them of their heavy load and these our ships you happily may think are like the trojan horse was stuff’d within with bloody veins expecting overthrow are stored with corn to make your needy bread and give them life whom hunger starved half dead
the gods of greece protect you
arise i pray you rise we do not look for reverence but for love and harbourage for ourself our ships and men
the which when any shall not gratify or pay you with unthankfulness in thought be it our wives our children or ourselves the curse of heaven and men succeed their evils
till when — the which i hope shall ne’er be seen — your grace is welcome to our town and us
which welcome we’ll accept feast here awhile until our stars that frown lend us a smile
here have you seen a mighty king his child iwis to incest bring a better prince and benign lord that will prove awful both in deed word
be quiet then as men should be till he hath pass’d necessity
i’ll show you those in troubles reign losing a mite a mountain gain
the good in conversation to whom i give my benison is still at tarsus where each man thinks all is writ he speken can and to remember what he does build his statue to make him glorious but tidings to the contrary are brought your eyes what need speak i
enter at one door pericles talking with cleon all the train with them
enter at another door a gentleman with a letter to pericles pericles shows the letter to cleon gives the messenger a reward and knights him
exit pericles at one door and cleon at another
good helicane that stay’d at home
not to eat honey like a drone from others’ labours for though he strive to killen bad keep good alive and to fulfil his prince’ desire sends word of all that haps in tyre how thaliard came full bent with sin and had intent to murder him and that in tarsus was not best longer for him to make his rest
he doing so put forth to seas where when men been there’s seldom ease for now the wind begins to blow thunder above and deeps below make such unquiet that the ship should house him safe is wreck’d and split and he good prince having all lost by waves from coast to coast is tost all perishen of man of pelf ne aught escapen but himself till fortune tired with doing bad threw him ashore to give him glad and here he comes
what shall be next pardon old gower — this longs the text
an open place by the seaside
yet cease your ire you angry stars of heaven
wind rain and thunder remember earthly man is but a substance that must yield to you and i as fits my nature do obey you alas the sea hath cast me on the rocks wash’d me from shore to shore and left me breath nothing to think on but ensuing death let it suffice the greatness of your powers to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes and having thrown him from your watery grave here to have death in peace is all he’ll crave
ha come and bring away the nets
come away or i’ll fetch thee with a wanion
faith master i am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now
alas poor souls it grieved my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them when well a day we could scarce help ourselves
nay master said not i as much when i saw the porpus how he bounced and tumbled
they say they’re half fish half flesh a plague on them they ne’er come but i look to be washed
master i marvel how the fishes live in the sea
why as men do a land the great ones eat up the little ones i can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale a’ plays and tumbles driving the poor fry before him and at last devours them all at a mouthful
such whales have i heard on o’ the land who never leave gaping till they swallowed the whole parish church steeple bells and all
but master if i had been the sexton i would have been that day in the belfry
because he should have swallowed me too and when i had been in his belly i would have kept such a jangling of the bells that he should never have left till he cast bells steeple church and parish up again
but if the good king simonides were of my mind — pericles
we would purge the land of these drones that rob the bee of her honey
aside how from the finny subject of the sea these fishers tell the infirmities of men and from their watery empire recollect all that may men approve or men detect
peace be at your labour honest fishermen
if it be a day fits you search out of the calendar and nobody look after it
may see the sea hath cast upon your coast
what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way
a man whom both the waters and the wind in that vast tennis court have made the ball for them to play upon entreats you pity him he asks of you that never used to beg
here’s them in our country of greece gets more with begging than we can do with working
canst thou catch any fishes then
nay then thou wilt starve sure for here’s nothing to be got now a days unless thou canst fish for’t
what i have been i have forgot to know but what i am want teaches me to think on a man throng’d up with cold my veins are chill and have no more of life than may suffice to give my tongue that heat to ask your help which if you shall refuse when i am dead for that i am a man pray see me buried
now gods forbid’t and i have a gown here come put it on keep thee warm
now afore me a handsome fellow
come thou shalt go home and we’ll have flesh for holidays fish for fasting days and moreo’er puddings and flap jacks and thou shalt be welcome
hark you my friend you said you could not beg
then i’ll turn craver too and so i shall ’scape whipping
why are your beggars whipped then
o not all my friend not all for if all your beggars were whipped i would wish no better office than to be beadle
but master i’ll go draw up the net
aside how well this honest mirth becomes their labour
hark you sir do you know where ye are
why i’ll tell you this is called pentapolis and our king the good simonides
the good simonides do you call him
ay sir and he deserves so to be called for his peaceable reign and good government
he is a happy king since he gains from his subjects the name of good government
how far is his court distant from this shore
marry sir half a day’s journey and i’ll tell you he hath a fair daughter and tomorrow is her birth day and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to joust and tourney for her love
were my fortunes equal to my desires i could wish to make one there
o sir things must be as they may and what a man cannot get he may lawfully deal for — his wife’s soul
re enter second and third fishermen drawing up a net
here’s a fish hangs in the net like a poor man’s right in the law ’twill hardly come out
bots on’t ’tis come at last and ’tis turned to a rusty armour
i pray you let me see it
thanks fortune yet that after all my crosses thou givest me somewhat to repair myself and though it was mine own part of my heritage which my dead father did bequeath to me with this strict charge even as he left his life
‘keep it my pericles it hath been a shield ’twixt me and death ’ — and pointed to this brace — ‘for that it saved me keep it in like necessity — the which the gods protect thee from
— may defend thee ’ it kept where i kept i so dearly loved it till the rough seas that spares not any man took it in rage though calm’d have given’t again i thank thee for’t my shipwreck now’s no ill since i have here my father gave in his will
to beg of you kind friends this coat of worth for it was sometime target to a king i know it by this mark
he loved me dearly and for his sake i wish the having of it and that you’d guide me to your sovereign court where with it i may appear a gentleman and if that ever my low fortune’s better i’ll pay your bounties till then rest your debtor
why wilt thou tourney for the lady
i’ll show the virtue i have borne in arms
why d’ye take it and the gods give thee good on’t
ay but hark you my friend ’twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters there are certain condolements certain vails
i hope sir if you thrive you’ll remember from whence you had them
by your furtherance i am clothed in steel and spite of all the rapture of the sea this jewel holds his building on my arm unto thy value i will mount myself upon a courser whose delightful steps shall make the gazer joy to see him tread
only my friend i yet am unprovided of a pair of bases
we’ll sure provide thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair and i’ll bring thee to the court myself
then honour be but a goal to my will this day i’ll rise or else add ill to ill exeunt scene ii
a public way or platform leading to the lists
a pavilion by the side of it for the reception of the king princess lords etc
enter simonides thaisa lords and attendants
are the knights ready to begin the triumph
they are my liege and stay your coming to present themselves
return them we are ready and our daughter in honour of whose birth these triumphs are sits here like beauty’s child whom nature gat for men to see and seeing wonder at
it pleaseth you my royal father to express my commendations great whose merit’s less
it’s fit it should be so for princes are a model which heaven makes like to itself as jewels lose their glory if neglected so princes their renowns if not respected
’tis now your honour daughter to entertain the labour of each knight in his device
which to preserve mine honour i’ll perform
the first knight passes by and his squire presents his shield to thaisa
who is the first that doth prefer himself
a knight of sparta my renowned father and the device he bears upon his shield is a black ethiope reaching at the sun the word lux tua vita mihi simonides
he loves you well that holds his life of you
the second knight passes by and his squire presents his shield to thaisa
who is the second that presents himself
a prince of macedon my royal father and the device he bears upon his shield is an arm’d knight that’s conquer’d by a lady the motto thus in spanish piu por dulzura que por forza the third knight passes by and his squire presents his shield to thaisa
the third of antioch and his device a wreath of chivalry the word me pompae provexit apex the fourth knight passes by and his squire presents his shield to thaisa
a burning torch that’s turned upside down the word quod me alit me extinguit simonides
which shows that beauty hath his power and will which can as well inflame as it can kill
the fifth knight passes by and his squire presents his shield to thaisa
the fifth an hand environed with clouds holding out gold that’s by the touchstone tried the motto thus sic spectanda fides the sixth knight pericles passes in rusty armour with bases and unaccompanied
he presents his device directly to thaisa
and what’s the sixth and last the which the knight himself with such a graceful courtesy deliver’d
he seems to be a stranger but his present is a wither’d branch that’s only green at top the motto in hac spe vivo simonides
a pretty moral from the dejected state wherein he is he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish
he had need mean better than his outward show can any way speak in his just commend for by his rusty outside he appears to have practised more the whipstock than the lance
he well may be a stranger for he comes to an honour’d triumph strangely furnished
and on set purpose let his armour rust until this day to scour it in the dust
opinion’s but a fool that makes us scan the outward habit by the inward man
but stay the knights are coming
we will withdraw into the gallery
great shouts within and all cry ‘the mean knight ’ scene iii
a hall of state a banquet prepared
enter simonides thaisa lords attendants and knights from tilting
knights to say you’re welcome were superfluous
to place upon the volume of your deeds as in a title page your worth in arms were more than you expect or more than’s fit since every worth in show commends itself
prepare for mirth for mirth becomes a feast you are princes and my guests
but you my knight and guest to whom this wreath of victory i give and crown you king of this day’s happiness
’tis more by fortune lady than by merit
call it by what you will the day is yours and here i hope is none that envies it
in framing an artist art hath thus decreed to make some good but others to exceed and you are her labour’d scholar
come queen of the feast — for daughter so you are — here take your place marshal the rest as they deserve their grace
we are honour’d much by good simonides
your presence glads our days honour we love for who hates honour hates the gods above
contend not sir for we are gentlemen have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes envied the great nor shall the low despise
by jove i wonder that is king of thoughts these cates resist me he but thought upon
by juno that is queen of marriage all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury wishing him my meat
he’s but a country gentleman has done no more than other knights have done has broken a staff or so so let it pass
to me he seems like diamond to glass
yon king’s to me like to my father’s picture which tells me in that glory once he was had princes sit like stars about his throne and he the sun for them to reverence none that beheld him but like lesser lights did vail their crowns to his supremacy where now his son’s like a glow worm in the night the which hath fire in darkness none in light whereby i see that time’s the king of men he’s both their parent and he is their grave and gives them what he will not what they crave
who can be other in this royal presence
here with a cup that’s stored unto the brim — as you do love fill to your mistress’ lips — we drink this health to you
yon knight doth sit too melancholy as if the entertainment in our court had not a show might countervail his worth
what is’t to me my father
o attend my daughter princes in this should live like god’s above who freely give to everyone that comes to honour them and princes not doing so are like to gnats which make a sound but kill’d are wonder’d at
therefore to make his entrance more sweet here say we drink this standing bowl of wine to him
alas my father it befits not me unto a stranger knight to be so bold he may my proffer take for an offence since men take women’s gifts for impudence
do as i bid you or you’ll move me else
aside now by the gods he could not please me better
and furthermore tell him we desire to know of him of whence he is his name and parentage
the king my father sir has drunk to you
wishing it so much blood unto your life
i thank both him and you and pledge him freely
and further he desires to know of you of whence you are your name and parentage
a gentleman of tyre my name pericles my education been in arts and arms who looking for adventures in the world was by the rough seas reft of ships and men and after shipwreck driven upon this shore
he thanks your grace names himself pericles a gentleman of tyre who only by misfortune of the seas bereft of ships and men cast on this shore
now by the gods i pity his misfortune and will awake him from his melancholy
come gentlemen we sit too long on trifles and waste the time which looks for other revels
even in your armours as you are address’d will well become a soldier’s dance
i will not have excuse with saying this ‘loud music is too harsh for ladies’ heads’ since they love men in arms as well as beds
the knights dance so this was well ask’d ’twas so well perform’d
come sir here is a lady which wants breathing too and i have heard you knights of tyre are excellent in making ladies trip and that their measures are as excellent
in those that practise them they are my lord
o that’s as much as you would be denied of your fair courtesy
the knights and ladies dance unclasp unclasp thanks gentlemen to all all have done well
to pericles but you the best
pages and lights to conduct these knights unto their several lodgings
to pericles yours sir we have given order to be next our own
i am at your grace’s pleasure
princes it is too late to talk of love and that’s the mark i know you level at therefore each one betake him to his rest tomorrow all for speeding do their best
a room in the governor’s house
no escanes know this of me antiochus from incest lived not free for which the most high gods not minding longer to withhold the vengeance that they had in store due to this heinous capital offence even in the height and pride of all his glory when he was seated in a chariot of an inestimable value and his daughter with him a fire from heaven came and shrivell’d up their bodies even to loathing for they so stunk that all those eyes adored them ere their fall scorn now their hand should give them burial
and yet but justice for though this king were great his greatness was no guard to bar heaven’s shaft but sin had his reward
see not a man in private conference or council has respect with him but he
it shall no longer grieve without reproof
and cursed be he that will not second it
and welcome happy day my lords
know that our griefs are risen to the top and now at length they overflow their banks
wrong not your prince you love
wrong not yourself then noble helicane but if the prince do live let us salute him
or know what ground’s made happy by his breath
if in the world he live we’ll seek him out if in his grave he rest we’ll find him there
we’ll be resolved he lives to govern us or dead give’s cause to mourn his funeral and leave us to our free election
whose death’s indeed the strongest in our censure and knowing this kingdom is without a head — like goodly buildings left without a roof soon fall to ruin — your noble self that best know how to rule and how to reign we thus submit unto — our sovereign
for honour’s cause forbear your suffrages if that you love prince pericles forbear
take i your wish i leap into the seas where’s hourly trouble for a minute’s ease
a twelvemonth longer let me entreat you to forbear the absence of your king if in which time expired he not return i shall with aged patience bear your yoke
but if i cannot win you to this love go search like nobles like noble subjects and in your search spend your adventurous worth whom if you find and win unto return you shall like diamonds sit about his crown
to wisdom he’s a fool that will not yield and since lord helicane enjoineth us we with our travels will endeavour us
then you love us we you and we’ll clasp hands when peers thus knit a kingdom ever stands
enter simonides reading a letter at one door the knights meet him
good morrow to the good simonides
knights from my daughter this i let you know that for this twelvemonth she’ll not undertake a married life
her reason to herself is only known which yet from her by no means can i get
may we not get access to her my lord
faith by no means she hath so strictly tied her to her chamber that ’tis impossible
one twelve moons more she’ll wear diana’s livery this by the eye of cynthia hath she vow’d and on her virgin honour will not break it
loath to bid farewell we take our leaves
so they are well dispatch’d now to my daughter’s letter she tells me here she’ll wed the stranger knight or never more to view nor day nor light
’tis well mistress your choice agrees with mine i like that well nay how absolute she’s in’t not minding whether i dislike or no
well i do commend her choice and will no longer have it be delay’d
here he comes i must dissemble it
all fortune to the good simonides
sir i am beholding to you for your sweet music this last night i do protest my ears were never better fed with such delightful pleasing harmony
it is your grace’s pleasure to commend not my desert
the worst of all her scholars my good lord
let me ask you one thing what do you think of my daughter sir
and she is fair too is she not
as a fair day in summer wondrous fair
sir my daughter thinks very well of you ay so well that you must be her master and she will be your scholar therefore look to it
i am unworthy for her schoolmaster
she thinks not so peruse this writing else
a letter that she loves the knight of tyre
’tis the king’s subtlety to have my life
o seek not to entrap me gracious lord a stranger and distressed gentleman that never aim’d so high to love your daughter but bent all offices to honour her
thou hast bewitch’d my daughter and thou art a villain
by the gods i have not never did thought of mine levy offence nor never did my actions yet commence a deed might gain her love or your displeasure
even in his throat — unless it be the king — that calls me traitor i return the lie
aside now by the gods i do applaud his courage
my actions are as noble as my thoughts that never relish’d of a base descent
i came unto your court for honour’s cause and not to be a rebel to her state and he that otherwise accounts of me this sword shall prove he’s honour’s enemy
here comes my daughter she can witness it
then as you are as virtuous as fair resolve your angry father if my tongue did e’er solicit or my hand subscribe to any syllable that made love to you
why sir say if you had who takes offence at that would make me glad
yea mistress are you so peremptory
aside i am glad on’t with all my heart
— i’ll tame you i’ll bring you in subjection
will you not having my consent bestow your love and your affections upon a stranger
aside who for aught i know may be nor can i think the contrary as great in blood as i myself
— therefore hear you mistress either frame your will to mine and you sir hear you either be ruled by me or i will make you — man and wife
nay come your hands and lips must seal it too and being join’d i’ll thus your hopes destroy and for further grief god give you joy
yes if you love me sir
even as my life my blood that fosters it
it pleaseth me so well that i will see you wed and then with what haste you can get you to bed
now sleep yslaked hath the rouse no din but snores about the house made louder by the o’erfed breast of this most pompous marriage feast
the cat with eyne of burning coal now couches fore the mouse’s hole and crickets sing at the oven’s mouth are the blither for their drouth
hymen hath brought the bride to bed where by the loss of maidenhead a babe is moulded
be attent and time that is so briefly spent with your fine fancies quaintly eche what’s dumb in show i’ll plain with speech
enter pericles and simonides at one door with attendants a messenger meets them kneels and gives pericles a letter pericles shows it simonides the lords kneel to him
then enter thaisa with child with lychorida a nurse
the king shows her the letter she rejoices she and pericles take leave of her father and depart with lychorida and their attendants
then exeunt simonides and the rest
by many a dern and painful perch of pericles the careful search by the four opposing coigns which the world together joins is made with all due diligence that horse and sail and high expense can stead the quest
at last from tyre fame answering the most strange enquire to th’ court of king simonides are letters brought the tenour these antiochus and his daughter dead the men of tyrus on the head of helicanus would set on the crown of tyre but he will none the mutiny he there hastes t’oppress says to ’em if king pericles come not home in twice six moons he obedient to their dooms will take the crown
the sum of this brought hither to pentapolis y ravished the regions round and everyone with claps can sound ‘our heir apparent is a king
who dreamt who thought of such a thing ’ brief he must hence depart to tyre his queen with child makes her desire — which who shall cross
— along to go omit we all their dole and woe lychorida her nurse she takes and so to sea
their vessel shakes on neptune’s billow half the flood hath their keel cut but fortune’s mood varies again the grisled north disgorges such a tempest forth that as a duck for life that dives so up and down the poor ship drives the lady shrieks and well a near does fall in travail with her fear and what ensues in this fell storm shall for itself itself perform
i nill relate action may conveniently the rest convey which might not what by me is told
in your imagination hold this stage the ship upon whose deck the sea tost pericles appears to speak
thou god of this great vast rebuke these surges which wash both heaven and hell and thou that hast upon the winds command bind them in brass having call’d them from the deep
o still thy deafening dreadful thunders gently quench thy nimble sulphurous flashes
o how lychorida how does my queen
thou stormest venomously wilt thou spit all thyself
the seaman’s whistle is as a whisper in the ears of death unheard
divinest patroness and midwife gentle to those that cry by night convey thy deity aboard our dancing boat make swift the pangs of my queen’s travails
here is a thing too young for such a place who if it had conceit would die as i am like to do take in your arms this piece of your dead queen
patience good sir do not assist the storm
here’s all that is left living of your queen a little daughter for the sake of it be manly and take comfort
why do you make us love your goodly gifts and snatch them straight away
we here below recall not what we give and therein may vie honour with you
now mild may be thy life
for a more blustrous birth had never babe quiet and gentle thy conditions
for thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world that ever was prince’s child
thou hast as chiding a nativity as fire air water earth and heaven can make to herald thee from the womb
even at the first thy loss is more than can thy portage quit with all thou canst find here now the good gods throw their best eyes upon’t
courage enough i do not fear the flaw it hath done to me the worst
yet for the love of this poor infant this fresh new sea farer i would it would be quiet
but sea room and the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon i care not
sir your queen must overboard the sea works high the wind is loud and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead
pardon us sir with us at sea it has been still observed and we are strong in custom
therefore briefly yield her for she must overboard straight
a terrible childbed hast thou had my dear no light no fire th’unfriendly elements forgot thee utterly nor have i time to give thee hallow’d to thy grave but straight must cast thee scarcely coffin’d in the ooze where for a monument upon thy bones and e’er remaining lamps the belching whale and humming water must o’erwhelm thy corpse lying with simple shells
bid nestor bring me spices ink and paper my casket and my jewels and bid nicander bring me the satin coffer lay the babe upon the pillow hie thee whiles i say a priestly farewell to her suddenly woman
sir we have a chest beneath the hatches caulked and bitumed ready
mariner say what coast is this
thither gentle mariner alter thy course for tyre
by break of day if the wind cease
there will i visit cleon for the babe cannot hold out to tyrus
there i’ll leave it at careful nursing
go thy ways good mariner i’ll bring the body presently
enter cerimon with a servant and some persons who have been shipwrecked
get fire and meat for these poor men ’t has been a turbulent and stormy night
i have been in many but such a night as this till now i ne’er endured
your master will be dead ere you return there’s nothing can be minister’d to nature that can recover him
to philemon give this to the ’pothecary and tell me how it works
exeunt all but cerimon enter two gentlemen
gentlemen why do you stir so early
sir our lodgings standing bleak upon the sea shook as the earth did quake the very principals did seem to rend and all to topple pure surprise and fear made me to quit the house
that is the cause we trouble you so early ’tis not our husbandry
but i much marvel that your lordship having rich tire about you should at these early hours shake off the golden slumber of repose
’tis most strange nature should be so conversant with pain
i hold it ever virtue and cunning were endowments greater than nobleness and riches careless heirs may the two latter darken and expend but immortality attends the former making a man a god
’tis known i ever have studied physic through which secret art by turning o’er authorities i have together with my practice made familiar to me and to my aid the blest infusions that dwell in vegetives in metals stones and i can speak of the disturbances that nature works and of her cures which doth give me a more content in course of true delight than to be thirsty after tottering honour or tie my pleasure up in silken bags to please the fool and death
your honour has through ephesus pour’d forth your charity and hundreds call themselves your creatures who by you have been restored and not your knowledge your personal pain but even your purse still open hath built lord cerimon such strong renown as time shall never— enter two or three servants with a chest
sir even now did the sea toss upon our shore this chest ’tis of some wreck
whate’er it be ’tis wondrous heavy
wrench it open straight if the sea’s stomach be o’ercharged with gold ’tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us
how close ’tis caulk’d and bitumed
did the sea cast it up
i never saw so huge a billow sir as toss’d it upon shore
it smells most sweetly in my sense
shrouded in cloth of state balm’d and entreasured with full bags of spices
apollo perfect me in the characters
reads from a scroll here i give to understand if e’er this coffin drives a land i king pericles have lost this queen worth all our mundane cost
who finds her give her burying she was the daughter of a king besides this treasure for a fee the gods requite his charity if thou livest pericles thou hast a heart that even cracks for woe
nay certainly tonight for look how fresh she looks
they were too rough that threw her in the sea
make a fire within fetch hither all my boxes in my closet
exit a servant death may usurp on nature many hours and yet the fire of life kindle again the o’erpress’d spirits
i heard of an egyptian that had nine hours lain dead who was by good appliance recovered
re enter a servant with napkins and fire
well said well said the fire and cloths
the rough and woeful music that we have cause it to sound beseech you the viol once more how thou stirr’st thou block
— i pray you give her air
nature awakes a warmth breathes out of her
she hath not been entranced above five hours
see how she ’gins to blow into life’s flower again
the heavens through you increase our wonder and sets up your fame for ever
she is alive behold her eyelids cases to those heavenly jewels which pericles hath lost begin to part their fringes of bright gold the diamonds of a most praised water doth appear to make the world twice rich
live and make us weep to hear your fate fair creature rare as you seem to be
o dear diana where am i
lend me your hands to the next chamber bear her
get linen now this matter must be look’d to for her relapse is mortal
come come and aesculapius guide us
exeunt carrying her away scene iii
enter pericles cleon dionyza and lychorida with marina in her arms
most honour’d cleon i must needs be gone my twelve months are expired and tyrus stands in a litigious peace
you and your lady take from my heart all thankfulness
the gods make up the rest upon you
your shafts of fortune though they hurt you mortally yet glance full wanderingly on us
that the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither to have bless’d mine eyes with her
we cannot but obey the powers above us
could i rage and roar as doth the sea she lies in yet the end must be as ’tis
my gentle babe marina whom for she was born at sea i have named so here i charge your charity withal leaving her the infant of your care beseeching you to give her princely training that she may be manner’d as she is born
fear not my lord but think your grace that fed my country with your corn for which the people’s prayers still fall upon you must in your child be thought on
if neglection should therein make me vile the common body by you relieved would force me to my duty but if to that my nature need a spur the gods revenge it upon me and mine to the end of generation
i believe you your honour and your goodness teach me to’t without your vows
till she be married madam by bright diana whom we honour all unscissored shall this hair of mine remain though i show ill in’t
good madam make me blessed in your care in bringing up my child
i have one myself who shall not be more dear to my respect than yours my lord
we’ll bring your grace e’en to the edge o’the shore then give you up to the mask’d neptune and the gentlest winds of heaven
o no tears lychorida no tears
look to your little mistress on whose grace you may depend hereafter
madam this letter and some certain jewels lay with you in your coffer which are at your command
that i was shipp’d at sea i well remember even on my groaning time but whether there deliver’d by the holy gods i cannot rightly say
but since king pericles my wedded lord i ne’er shall see again a vestal livery will i take me to and never more have joy
madam if this you purpose as ye speak diana’s temple is not distant far where you may abide till your date expire
moreover if you please a niece of mine shall there attend you
my recompense is thanks that’s all yet my good will is great though the gift small
imagine pericles arrived at tyre welcomed and settled to his own desire
his woeful queen we leave at ephesus unto diana there a votaress
now to marina bend your mind whom our fast growing scene must find at tarsus and by cleon train’d in music’s letters who hath gain’d of education all the grace which makes her both the heart and place of general wonder
but alack that monster envy oft the wrack of earned praise marina’s life seeks to take off by treason’s knife and in this kind our cleon hath one daughter and a full grown wench even ripe for marriage rite this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be
be’t when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to th’ lute she sung and made the night bird mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so the dove of paphos might with the crow vie feathers white
marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given
this so darks in philoten all graceful marks that cleon’s wife with envy rare a present murderer does prepare for good marina that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter
the sooner her vile thoughts to stead lychorida our nurse is dead and cursed dionyza hath the pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow
the unborn event i do commend to your content only i carry winged time post on the lame feet of my rhyme which never could i so convey unless your thoughts went on my way
dionyza does appear with leonine a murderer
an open place near the seashore
thy oath remember thou hast sworn to do’t ’tis but a blow which never shall be known
thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon to yield thee so much profit
let not conscience which is but cold inflaming love i’ thy bosom inflame too nicely nor let pity which even women have cast off melt thee but be a soldier to thy purpose
i will do’t but yet she is a goodly creature
the fitter then the gods should have her
here she comes weeping for her only mistress’ death
enter marina with a basket of flowers
no i will rob tellus of her weed to strew thy green with flowers the yellows blues the purple violets and marigolds shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave while summer days do last
poor maid born in a tempest when my mother died this world to me is like a lasting storm whirring me from my friends
how chance my daughter is not with you
do not consume your blood with sorrowing have you a nurse of me
lord how your favour’s changed with this unprofitable woe
come give me your flowers ere the sea mar it
walk with leonine the air is quick there and it pierces and sharpens the stomach
come leonine take her by the arm walk with her
no i pray you i’ll not bereave you of your servant
come come i love the king your father and yourself with more than foreign heart
we every day expect him here when he shall come and find our paragon to all reports thus blasted he will repent the breadth of his great voyage blame both my lord and me that we have taken no care to your best courses
go i pray you walk and be cheerful once again reserve that excellent complexion which did steal the eyes of young and old
care not for me i can go home alone
well i will go but yet i have no desire to it
come come i know ’tis good for you
walk half an hour leonine at the least remember what i have said
i’ll leave you my sweet lady for a while pray walk softly do not heat your blood what
i must have a care of you
exit dionyza is this wind westerly that blows
when i was born the wind was north
my father as nurse said did never fear but cried ‘good seamen ’ to the sailors galling his kingly hands haling ropes and clasping to the mast endured a sea that almost burst the deck
when i was born never was waves nor wind more violent and from the ladder tackle washes off a canvas climber
‘ha ’ says one ‘wolt out ’ and with a dropping industry they skip from stem to stern the boatswain whistles and the master calls and trebles their confusion
if you require a little space for prayer i grant it pray but be not tedious for the gods are quick of ear and i am sworn to do my work with haste
why would she have me kill’d now
as i can remember by my troth i never did her hurt in all my life i never spake bad word nor did ill turn to any living creature believe me la i never kill’d a mouse nor hurt a fly i trod upon a worm against my will but i wept for it
how have i offended wherein my death might yield her any profit or my life imply her any danger
my commission is not to reason of the deed but do it
you will not do’t for all the world i hope
you are well favour’d and your looks foreshow you have a gentle heart
i saw you lately when you caught hurt in parting two that fought good sooth it show’d well in you do so now your lady seeks my life come you between and save poor me the weaker
i am sworn and will dispatch
half part mates half part come let’s have her aboard suddenly
exeunt pirates with marina re enter leonine
these roguing thieves serve the great pirate valdes and they have seized marina
let her go there’s no hope she will return
i’ll swear she’s dead and thrown into the sea
but i’ll see further perhaps they will but please themselves upon her not carry her aboard
if she remain whom they have ravish’d must by me be slain
search the market narrowly mytilene is full of gallants
we lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless
we were never so much out of creatures
we have but poor three and they can do no more than they can do and they with continual action are even as good as rotten
therefore let’s have fresh ones whate’er we pay for them
if there be not a conscience to be used in every trade we shall never prosper
thou sayest true ’tis not our bringing up of poor bastards — as i think i have brought up some eleven — boult
ay to eleven and brought them down again
but shall i search the market
the stuff we have a strong wind will blow it to pieces they are so pitifully sodden
thou sayest true they’re too unwholesome o’ conscience
the poor transylvanian is dead that lay with the little baggage
ay she quickly pooped him she made him roast meat for worms
but i’ll go search the market
three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a proportion to live quietly and so give over
why to give over i pray you
is it a shame to get when we are old
o our credit comes not in like the commodity nor the commodity wages not with the danger therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate ’twere not amiss to keep our door hatched
besides the sore terms we stand upon with the gods will be strong with us for giving over
come others sorts offend as well as we
ay and better too we offend worse
neither is our profession any trade it’s no calling
re enter boult with the pirates and marina
boult to pirates come your ways
my masters you say she’s a virgin
o sir we doubt it not
master i have gone through for this piece you see if you like her so if not i have lost my earnest
she has a good face speaks well and has excellent good clothes there’s no farther necessity of qualities can make her be refused
i cannot be baited one doit of a thousand pieces
well follow me my masters you shall have your money presently
wife take her in instruct her what she has to do that she may not be raw in her entertainment
boult take you the marks of her the colour of her hair complexion height her age with warrant of her virginity and cry ‘he that will give most shall have her first ’ such a maidenhead were no cheap thing if men were as they have been
get this done as i command you
alack that leonine was so slack so slow
he should have struck not spoke or that these pirates not enough barbarous had not o’erboard thrown me for to seek my mother
come the gods have done their part in you
you are light into my hands where you are like to live
the more my fault to scape his hands where i was like to die
ay and you shall live in pleasure
yes indeed shall you and taste gentlemen of all fashions you shall fare well you shall have the difference of all complexions
what would you have me be an i be not a woman
an honest woman or not a woman
marry whip the gosling i think i shall have something to do with you
come you’re a young foolish sapling and must be bowed as i would have you
if it please the gods to defend you by men then men must comfort you men must feed you men stir you up
now sir hast thou cried her through the market
i have cried her almost to the number of her hairs i have drawn her picture with my voice
and i prithee tell me how dost thou find the inclination of the people especially of the younger sort
faith they listened to me as they would have hearkened to their father’s testament
there was a spaniard’s mouth so watered that he went to bed to her very description
we shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on
but mistress do you know the french knight that cowers i’ the hams
ay he he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation but he made a groan at it and swore he would see her tomorrow
well well as for him he brought his disease hither here he does but repair it
i know he will come in our shadow to scatter his crowns in the sun
well if we had of every nation a traveller we should lodge them with this sign
to marina pray you come hither awhile
you have fortunes coming upon you
mark me you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly despise profit where you have most gain
to weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion and that opinion a mere profit
o take her home mistress take her home these blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practice
thou sayest true i’faith so they must for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant
faith some do and some do not
but mistress if i have bargained for the joint — bawd
thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit
come young one i like the manner of your garments well
ay by my faith they shall not be changed yet
boult spend thou that in the town report what a sojourner we have you’ll lose nothing by custom
when nature framed this piece she meant thee a good turn therefore say what a paragon she is and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report
i warrant you mistress thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclined
if fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep untied i still my virgin knot will keep
what have we to do with diana
pray you will you go with us
o dionyza such a piece of slaughter the sun and moon ne’er look’d upon
i think you’ll turn a child again
were i chief lord of all this spacious world i’d give it to undo the deed
a lady much less in blood than virtue yet a princess to equal any single crown o’ the earth i’ the justice of compare
whom thou hast poison’d too if thou hadst drunk to him ’t had been a kindness becoming well thy face
what canst thou say when noble pericles shall demand his child
nurses are not the fates to foster it nor ever to preserve
she died at night i’ll say so
unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out ‘she died by foul play ’ cleon
well well of all the faults beneath the heavens the gods do like this worst
be one of those that thinks the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence and open this to pericles
i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit
to such proceeding whoever but his approbation added though not his prime consent he did not flow from honourable sources dionyza
be it so then yet none does know but you how she came dead nor none can know leonine being gone
she did distain my child and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her but cast their gazes on marina’s face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day
it pierced me through and though you call my course unnatural you not your child well loving yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness perform’d to your sole daughter
and as for pericles what should he say
we wept after her hearse and yet we mourn
her monument is almost finish’d and her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her and care in us at whose expense ’tis done
thou art like the harpy which to betray dost with thine angel’s face seize with thine eagle’s talons
you are like one that superstitiously doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies but yet i know you’ll do as i advise
enter gower before the monument of marina at tarsus
thus time we waste and long leagues make short sail seas in cockles have and wish but for’t making to take your imagination from bourn to bourn region to region
by you being pardon’d we commit no crime to use one language in each several clime where our scenes seem to live
i do beseech you to learn of me who stand i’the gaps to teach you the stages of our story
pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas attended on by many a lord and knight to see his daughter all his life’s delight
behind is left to govern if you bear in mind old escanes whom helicanus late advanced in time to great and high estate
well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought this king to tarsus — think his pilot thought so with his steerage shall your thoughts go on — to fetch his daughter home who first is gone
like motes and shadows see them move awhile your ears unto your eyes i’ll reconcile
enter pericles at one door with all his train cleon and dionyza at the other
cleon shows pericles the tomb whereat pericles makes lamentation puts on sackcloth and in a mighty passion departs
see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrow’d passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devour’d with sighs shot through and biggest tears o’ershower’d leaves tarsus and again embarks
he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out
now please you wit the epitaph is for marina writ by wicked dionyza
reads the inscription on marina’s monument the fairest sweet’st and best lies here who wither’d in her spring of year
she was of tyrus the king’s daughter on whom foul death hath made this slaughter marina was she call’d and at her birth thetis being proud swallow’d some part o’ the earth therefore the earth fearing to be o’erflow’d hath thetis’ birth child on the heavens bestow’d wherefore she does and swears she’ll never stint make raging battery upon shores of flint no visor does become black villany so well as soft and tender flattery
let pericles believe his daughter’s dead and bear his courses to be ordered by lady fortune while our scene must play his daughter’s woe and heavy well a day in her unholy service
patience then and think you now are all in mytilene
enter from the brothel two gentlemen
did you ever hear the like
no nor never shall do in such a place as this she being once gone
but to have divinity preached there
did you ever dream of such a thing
come i am for no more bawdy houses shall’s go hear the vestals sing
i’ll do anything now that is virtuous but i am out of the road of rutting for ever
well i had rather than twice the worth of her she had ne’er come here
she’s able to freeze the god priapus and undo a whole generation
we must either get her ravished or be rid of her
when she should do for clients her fitment and do me the kindness of our profession she has me her quirks her reasons her master reasons her prayers her knees that she would make a puritan of the devil if he should cheapen a kiss of her
faith i must ravish her or she’ll disfurnish us of all our cavaliers and make our swearers priests
now the pox upon her green sickness for me
faith there’s no way to be rid on’t but by the way to the pox
here comes the lord lysimachus disguised
we should have both lord and lown if the peevish baggage would but give way to customers
now the gods to bless your honour
i am glad to see your honour in good health
you may so ’tis the better for you that your resorters stand upon sound legs
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal withal and defy the surgeon
we have here one sir if she would — but there never came her like in mytilene
if she’d do the deed of darkness thou wouldst say
your honour knows what ’tis to say well enough
for flesh and blood sir white and red you shall see a rose and she were a rose indeed if she had but — lysimachus
o sir i can be modest
that dignifies the renown of a bawd no less than it gives a good report to a number to be chaste
here comes that which grows to the stalk never plucked yet i can assure you
is she not a fair creature
faith she would serve after a long voyage at sea
well there’s for you leave us
i beseech your honour give me leave a word and i’ll have done presently
to marina first i would have you note this is an honourable man
i desire to find him so that i may worthily note him
next he’s the governor of this country and a man whom i am bound to
if he govern the country you are bound to him indeed but how honourable he is in that i know not
pray you without any more virginal fencing will you use him kindly
he will line your apron with gold
what he will do graciously i will thankfully receive
my lord she’s not paced yet you must take some pains to work her to your manage
come we will leave his honour and her together
exeunt bawd pandar and boult lysimachus
now pretty one how long have you been at this trade
why i cannot name’t but i shall offend
i cannot be offended with my trade
how long have you been of this profession
did you go to’t so young
were you a gamester at five or at seven
earlier too sir if now i be one
why the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of sale
do you know this house to be a place of such resort and will come into’t
i hear say you are of honourable parts and are the governor of this place
why hath your principal made known unto you who i am
why your herb woman she that sets seeds and roots of shame and iniquity
o you have heard something of my power and so stand aloof for more serious wooing
but i protest to thee pretty one my authority shall not see thee or else look friendly upon thee
come bring me to some private place come come
if you were born to honour show it now if put upon you make the judgement good that thought you worthy of it
for me that am a maid though most ungentle fortune have placed me in this sty where since i came diseases have been sold dearer than physic o that the gods would set me free from this unhallow’d place though they did change me to the meanest bird that flies i’ the purer air
i did not think thou couldst have spoke so well ne’er dream’d thou couldst
had i brought hither a corrupted mind thy speech had alter’d it
hold here’s gold for thee persever in that clear way thou goest and the gods strengthen thee
for me be you thoughten that i came with no ill intent for to me the very doors and windows savour vilely
thou art a piece of virtue and i doubt not but thy training hath been noble
hold here’s more gold for thee
a curse upon him die he like a thief that robs thee of thy goodness
if thou dost hear from me it shall be for thy good
i beseech your honour one piece for me
your house but for this virgin that doth prop it would sink and overwhelm you
we must take another course with you
if your peevish chastity which is not worth a breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope shall undo a whole household let me be gelded like a spaniel
i must have your maidenhead taken off or the common hangman shall execute it
we’ll have no more gentlemen driven away
worse and worse mistress she has here spoken holy words to the lord lysimachus
she makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of the gods
marry hang her up for ever
the nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman and she sent him away as cold as a snowball saying his prayers too
boult take her away use her at thy pleasure crack the glass of her virginity and make the rest malleable
an if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is she shall be ploughed
would she had never come within my doors
will you not go the way of womankind
marry come up my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays
come mistress come your way with me
to take from you the jewel you hold so dear
prithee tell me one thing first
what canst thou wish thine enemy to be
why i could wish him to be my master or rather my mistress
neither of these are so bad as thou art since they do better thee in their command
thou hold’st a place for which the pained’st fiend of hell would not in reputation change thou art the damned doorkeeper to every coistrel that comes inquiring for his tib
to the choleric fisting of every rogue thy ear is liable thy food is such as hath been belch’d on by infected lungs
what would you have me do
go to the wars would you
where a man may serve seven years for the loss of a leg and have not money enough in the end to buy him a wooden one
do anything but this thou doest
empty old receptacles or common shores of filth serve by indenture to the common hangman any of these ways are yet better than this for what thou professest a baboon could he speak would own a name too dear
o that the gods would safely deliver me from this place
if that thy master would gain by me proclaim that i can sing weave sew and dance with other virtues which i’ll keep from boast and i will undertake all these to teach
i doubt not but this populous city will yield many scholars
but can you teach all this you speak of
prove that i cannot take me home again and prostitute me to the basest groom that doth frequent your house
well i will see what i can do for thee if i can place thee i will
faith my acquaintance lies little amongst them
but since my master and mistress have bought you there’s no going but by their consent therefore i will make them acquainted with your purpose and i doubt not but i shall find them tractable enough
come i’ll do for thee what i can come your ways
marina thus the brothel ’scapes and chances into an honest house our story says
she sings like one immortal and she dances as goddess like to her admired lays deep clerks she dumbs and with her nee’le composes nature’s own shape of bud bird branch or berry that even her art sisters the natural roses her inkle silk twin with the rubied cherry that pupils lacks she none of noble race who pour their bounty on her and her gain she gives the cursed bawd
here we her place and to her father turn our thoughts again where we left him on the sea
we there him lost whence driven before the winds he is arrived here where his daughter dwells and on this coast suppose him now at anchor
the city strived god neptune’s annual feast to keep from whence lysimachus our tyrian ship espies his banners sable trimm’d with rich expense and to him in his barge with fervour hies
in your supposing once more put your sight of heavy pericles think this his bark where what is done in action more if might shall be discover’d please you sit and hark
on board pericles’ ship off mytilene
a close pavilion on deck with a curtain before it pericles within it reclined on a couch
a barge lying beside the tyrian vessel
enter two sailors one belonging to the tyrian vessel the other to the barge to them helicanus
to the sailor of mytilene where is lord helicanus
sir there’s a barge put off from mytilene and in it is lysimachus the governor who craves to come aboard
gentlemen there is some of worth would come aboard i pray ye greet them fairly
the gentlemen and the two sailors descend and go on board the barge enter from thence lysimachus and lords with the gentlemen and the two sailors
sir this is the man that can in aught you would resolve you
and you sir to outlive the age i am and die as i would do
being on shore honouring of neptune’s triumphs seeing this goodly vessel ride before us i made to it to know of whence you are
i am the governor of this place you lie before
sir our vessel is of tyre in it the king a man who for this three months hath not spoken to anyone nor taken sustenance but to prorogue his grief
upon what ground is his distemperature
’twould be too tedious to repeat but the main grief springs from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife
you may but bootless is your sight he will not speak to any
yet let me obtain my wish
pericles discovered this was a goodly person
till the disaster that one mortal night drove him to this
it is in vain he will not speak to you
sir we have a maid in mytilene i durst wager would win some words of him
she questionless with her sweet harmony and other chosen attractions would allure and make a battery through his deafen’d parts which now are midway stopp’d she is all happy as the fairest of all and with her fellow maids is now upon the leafy shelter that abuts against the island’s side
whispers a lord who goes off in the barge of lysimachus helicanus
sure all’s effectless yet nothing we’ll omit that bears recovery’s name
but since your kindness we have stretch’d thus far let us beseech you that for our gold we may provision have wherein we are not destitute for want but weary for the staleness
o sir a courtesy which if we should deny the most just gods for every graff would send a caterpillar and so inflict our province
yet once more let me entreat to know at large the cause of your king’s sorrow
sit sir i will recount it to you but see i am prevented
re enter from the barge lord with marina and a young lady
o here is the lady that i sent for
she’s such a one that were i well assured came of a gentle kind and noble stock i’d wish no better choice and think me rarely wed fair one all goodness that consists in bounty expect even here where is a kingly patient if that thy prosperous and artificial feat can draw him but to answer thee in aught thy sacred physic shall receive such pay as thy desires can wish
sir i will use my utmost skill in his recovery provided that none but i and my companion maid be suffer’d to come near him
come let us leave her and the gods make her prosperous
no nor look’d on us lysimachus
see she will speak to him
i am a maid my lord that ne’er before invited eyes but have been gazed on like a comet she speaks my lord that may be hath endured a grief might equal yours if both were justly weigh’d
though wayward fortune did malign my state my derivation was from ancestors who stood equivalent with mighty kings but time hath rooted out my parentage and to the world and awkward casualties bound me in servitude
aside i will desist but there is something glows upon my cheek and whispers in mine ear ‘go not till he speak ’ pericles
my fortunes — parentage — good parentage — to equal mine
i said my lord if you did know my parentage
you would not do me violence
pray you turn your eyes upon me
you are like something that — what country woman
no nor of any shores yet i was mortally brought forth and am no other than i appear
i am great with woe and shall deliver weeping
my dearest wife was like this maid and such a one my daughter might have been my queen’s square brows her stature to an inch as wand like straight as silver voiced her eyes as jewel like and cased as richly in pace another juno who starves the ears she feeds and makes them hungry the more she gives them speech
where i am but a stranger from the deck you may discern the place
and how achieved you these endowments which you make more rich to owe
if i should tell my history it would seem like lies disdain’d in the reporting
prithee speak falseness cannot come from thee for thou look’st modest as justice and thou seem’st a palace for the crown’d truth to dwell in i will believe thee and make my senses credit thy relation to points that seem impossible for thou look’st like one i loved indeed
didst thou not say when i did push thee back — which was when i perceived thee — that thou cam’st from good descending
i think thou said’st thou hadst been toss’d from wrong to injury and that thou thought’st thy griefs might equal mine if both were open’d
some such thing i said and said no more but what my thoughts did warrant me was likely
tell thy story if thine consider’d prove the thousand part of my endurance thou art a man and i have suffer’d like a girl yet thou dost look like patience gazing on kings’ graves and smiling extremity out of act
thy name my most kind virgin
recount i do beseech thee come sit by me
o i am mock’d and thou by some incensed god sent hither to make the world to laugh at me
patience good sir or here i’ll cease
thou little know’st how thou dost startle me to call thyself marina
the name was given me by one that had some power my father and a king
you said you would believe me but not to be a troubler of your peace i will end here
but are you flesh and blood
call’d marina for i was born at sea
my mother was the daughter of a king who died the minute i was born as my good nurse lychorida hath oft deliver’d weeping
aside this is the rarest dream that e’er dull sleep did mock sad fools withal this cannot be my daughter buried
i’ll hear you more to the bottom of your story and never interrupt you
you scorn believe me ’twere best i did give o’er
i will believe you by the syllable of what you shall deliver
yet give me leave how came you in these parts
the king my father did in tarsus leave me till cruel cleon with his wicked wife did seek to murder me and having woo’d a villain to attempt it who having drawn to do’t a crew of pirates came and rescued me brought me to mytilene
it may be you think me an impostor no good faith i am the daughter to king pericles if good king pericles be
thou art a grave and noble counsellor most wise in general tell me if thou canst what this maid is or what is like to be that thus hath made me weep
i know not but here is the regent sir of mytilene speaks nobly of her
she would never tell her parentage being demanded that she would sit still and weep
o helicanus strike me honour’d sir give me a gash put me to present pain lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me o’erbear the shores of my mortality and drown me with their sweetness
to marina o come hither thou that beget’st him that did thee beget thou that wast born at sea buried at tarsus and found at sea again
o helicanus down on thy knees thank the holy gods as loud as thunder threatens us this is marina
tell me but that for truth can never be confirm’d enough though doubts did ever sleep
first sir i pray what is your title
i am pericles of tyre but tell me now my drown’d queen’s name as in the rest you said thou hast been godlike perfect the heir of kingdoms and another life to pericles thy father
is it no more to be your daughter than to say my mother’s name was thaisa
thaisa was my mother who did end the minute i began
mine own helicanus she is not dead at tarsus as she should have been by savage cleon she shall tell thee all when thou shalt kneel and justify in knowledge she is thy very princess
sir ’tis the governor of mytilene who hearing of your melancholy state did come to see you
i am wild in my beholding
tell helicanus my marina tell him o’er point by point for yet he seems to doubt how sure you are my daughter
it is not good to cross him give him way
it nips me unto listening and thick slumber hangs upon mine eyes let me rest
a pillow for his head so leave him all
well my companion friends if this but answer to my just belief i’ll well remember you
exeunt all but pericles diana appears to pericles as in a vision
my temple stands in ephesus hie thee thither and do upon mine altar sacrifice
there when my maiden priests are met together before the people all reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife to mourn thy crosses with thy daughter’s call and give them repetition to the life
or perform my bidding or thou livest in woe do it and happy by my silver bow
celestial dian goddess argentine i will obey thee
re enter helicanus lysimachus and marina
my purpose was for tarsus there to strike the inhospitable cleon but i am for other service first toward ephesus turn our blown sails eftsoons i’ll tell thee why
to lysimachus shall we refresh us sir upon your shore and give you gold for such provision as our intents will need
sir with all my heart and when you come ashore i have another suit
you shall prevail were it to woo my daughter for it seems you have been noble towards her
enter gower before the temple of diana at ephesus
now our sands are almost run more a little and then dumb
this my last boon give me for such kindness must relieve me that you aptly will suppose what pageantry what feats what shows what minstrelsy and pretty din the regent made in mytilene to greet the king
so he thrived that he is promised to be wived to fair marina but in no wise till he had done his sacrifice as dian bade whereto being bound the interim pray you all confound
in feather’d briefness sails are fill’d and wishes fall out as they’re will’d
at ephesus the temple see our king and all his company
that he can hither come so soon is by your fancy’s thankful doom
the temple of diana at ephesus thaisa standing near the altar as high priestess a number of virgins on each side cerimon and other inhabitants of ephesus attending
enter pericles with his train lysimachus helicanus marina and a lady
to perform thy just command i here confess myself the king of tyre who frighted from my country did wed at pentapolis the fair thaisa
at sea in childbed died she but brought forth a maid child call’d marina whom o goddess wears yet thy silver livery
she at tarsus was nursed with cleon who at fourteen years he sought to murder but her better stars brought her to mytilene ’gainst whose shore riding her fortunes brought the maid aboard us where by her own most clear remembrance she made known herself my daughter
you are you are — o royal pericles
noble sir if you have told diana’s altar true this is your wife
reverend appearer no i threw her overboard with these very arms
upon this coast i warrant you
look to the lady o she’s but o’er joy’d
early in blustering morn this lady was thrown upon this shore
i oped the coffin found there rich jewels recover’d her and placed her here in diana’s temple
great sir they shall be brought you to my house whither i invite you
if he be none of mine my sanctity will to my sense bend no licentious ear but curb it spite of seeing
o my lord are you not pericles
like him you spake like him you are did you not name a tempest a birth and death
that thaisa am i supposed dead and drown’d
now i know you better when we with tears parted pentapolis the king my father gave you such a ring
this this no more you gods
your present kindness makes my past miseries sports you shall do well that on the touching of her lips i may melt and no more be seen
o come be buried a second time within these arms
my heart leaps to be gone into my mother’s bosom
flesh of thy flesh thaisa thy burden at the sea and call’d marina for she was yielded there
you have heard me say when i did fly from tyre i left behind an ancient substitute can you remember what i call’d the man i have named him oft
still confirmation embrace him dear thaisa this is he
now do i long to hear how you were found how possibly preserved and who to thank besides the gods for this great miracle
lord cerimon my lord this man through whom the gods have shown their power that can from first to last resolve you
reverend sir the gods can have no mortal officer more like a god than you
will you deliver how this dead queen relives
beseech you first go with me to my house where shall be shown you all was found with her how she came placed here in the temple no needful thing omitted
pure dian bless thee for thy vision
i will offer night oblations to thee
thaisa this prince the fair betrothed of your daughter shall marry her at pentapolis
and now this ornament makes me look dismal will i clip to form and what this fourteen years no razor touch’d to grace thy marriage day i’ll beautify
lord cerimon hath letters of good credit sir my father’s dead
heavens make a star of him
yet there my queen we’ll celebrate their nuptials and ourselves will in that kingdom spend our following days our son and daughter shall in tyrus reign
lord cerimon we do our longing stay to hear the rest untold
in antiochus and his daughter you have heard of monstrous lust the due and just reward in pericles his queen and daughter seen although assail’d with fortune fierce and keen virtue preserved from fell destruction’s blast led on by heaven and crown’d with joy at last
in helicanus may you well descry a figure of truth of faith of loyalty in reverend cerimon there well appears the worth that learned charity aye wears for wicked cleon and his wife when fame had spread their cursed deed the honour’d name of pericles to rage the city turn that him and his they in his palace burn
the gods for murder seemed so content to punish although not done but meant
so on your patience evermore attending new joy wait on you
exit the life and death of king richard the second contents act i scene i london

act iv scene i westminster hall
a street leading to the tower
a room in the duke of york’s palace
enter king richard john of gaunt with other nobles and attendants
old john of gaunt time honoured lancaster hast thou according to thy oath and band brought hither henry hereford thy bold son here to make good the boist’rous late appeal which then our leisure would not let us hear against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
tell me moreover hast thou sounded him if he appeal the duke on ancient malice or worthily as a good subject should on some known ground of treachery in him
as near as i could sift him on that argument on some apparent danger seen in him aimed at your highness no inveterate malice
then call them to our presence
face to face and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear the accuser and the accused freely speak
high stomached are they both and full of ire in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
many years of happy days befall my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
each day still better other’s happiness until the heavens envying earth’s good hap add an immortal title to your crown
yet one but flatters us as well appeareth by the cause you come namely to appeal each other of high treason
cousin of hereford what dost thou object against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
first—heaven be the record to my speech — in the devotion of a subject’s love tend’ring the precious safety of my prince and free from other misbegotten hate come i appellant to this princely presence
now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee and mark my greeting well for what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth or my divine soul answer it in heaven
thou art a traitor and a miscreant too good to be so and too bad to live since the more fair and crystal is the sky the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
once more the more to aggravate the note with a foul traitor’s name stuff i thy throat and wish so please my sovereign ere i move what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
’tis not the trial of a woman’s war the bitter clamour of two eager tongues can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain the blood is hot that must be cooled for this
yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hushed and naught at all to say
first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech which else would post until it had returned these terms of treason doubled down his throat
setting aside his high blood’s royalty and let him be no kinsman to my liege i do defy him and i spit at him call him a slanderous coward and a villain which to maintain i would allow him odds and meet him were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps or any other ground inhabitable wherever englishman durst set his foot
meantime let this defend my loyalty by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
pale trembling coward there i throw my gage disclaiming here the kindred of the king and lay aside my high blood’s royalty which fear not reverence makes thee to except
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honour’s pawn then stoop
by that and all the rites of knighthood else will i make good against thee arm to arm what i have spoke or thou canst worst devise
i take it up and by that sword i swear which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder i’ll answer thee in any fair degree or chivalrous design of knightly trial
and when i mount alive may i not light if i be traitor or unjustly fight
what doth our cousin lay to mowbray’s charge
it must be great that can inherit us so much as of a thought of ill in him
look what i speak my life shall prove it true that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers the which he hath detained for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain
besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was surveyed by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring
further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucester’s death suggest his soon believing adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificing abel’s cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement
and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent
how high a pitch his resolution soars
thomas of norfolk what sayst thou to this
let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf till i have told this slander of his blood how god and good men hate so foul a liar
mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears
were he my brother nay my kingdom’s heir as he is but my father’s brother’s son now by my sceptre’s awe i make a vow such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood should nothing privilege him nor partialize the unstooping firmness of my upright soul
he is our subject mowbray so art thou
free speech and fearless i to thee allow
then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly to his highness’ soldiers the other part reserved i by consent for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account since last i went to france to fetch his queen
for gloucester’s death i slew him not but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case
for you my noble lord of lancaster the honourable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly begged your grace’s pardon and i hope i had it
as for the rest appealed it issues from the rancour of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitor’s foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chambered in his bosom
in haste whereof most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day
wrath kindled gentlemen be ruled by me
let’s purge this choler without letting blood
this we prescribe though no physician deep malice makes too deep incision
forget forgive conclude and be agreed our doctors say this is no month to bleed
good uncle let this end where it begun we’ll calm the duke of norfolk you your son
to be a make peace shall become my age
throw down my son the duke of norfolk’s gage
obedience bids i should not bid again
norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot
myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
my life thou shalt command but not my shame
the one my duty owes but my fair name despite of death that lives upon my grave to dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have
i am disgraced impeached and baffled here pierced to the soul with slander’s venomed spear the which no balm can cure but his heart blood which breathed this poison
yea but not change his spots
take but my shame and i resign my gage
my dear dear lord the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay
a jewel in a ten times barred up chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
mine honour is my life both grow in one
take honour from me and my life is done
then dear my liege mine honour let me try in that i live and for that will i die
cousin throw up your gage do you begin
o god defend my soul from such deep sin
shall i seem crest fallen in my father’s sight
or with pale beggar fear impeach my height before this outdared dastard
ere my tongue shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace where shame doth harbour even in mowbray’s face
we were not born to sue but to command which since we cannot do to make you friends be ready as your lives shall answer it at coventry upon saint lambert’s day
there shall your swords and lances arbitrate the swelling difference of your settled hate
since we cannot atone you we shall see justice design the victor’s chivalry
lord marshal command our officers at arms be ready to direct these home alarms
a room in the duke of lancaster’s palace
enter john of gaunt with the duchess of gloucester
alas the part i had in woodstock’s blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims to stir against the butchers of his life
but since correction lieth in those hands which made the fault that we cannot correct put we our quarrel to the will of heaven who when they see the hours ripe on earth will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads
finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
hath love in thy old blood no living fire
edward’s seven sons whereof thyself art one were as seven vials of his sacred blood or seven fair branches springing from one root
some of those seven are dried by nature’s course some of those branches by the destinies cut but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester one vial full of edward’s sacred blood one flourishing branch of his most royal root is cracked and all the precious liquor spilt is hacked down and his summer leaves all faded by envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe
that bed that womb that metal that self mould that fashioned thee made him a man and though thou livest and breathest yet art thou slain in him
thou dost consent in some large measure to thy father’s death in that thou seest thy wretched brother die who was the model of thy father’s life
call it not patience gaunt it is despair
in suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaughtered thou showest the naked pathway to thy life teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
that which in mean men we entitle patience is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
to safeguard thine own life the best way is to venge my gloucester’s death
god’s is the quarrel for god’s substitute his deputy anointed in his sight hath caused his death the which if wrongfully let heaven revenge for i may never lift an angry arm against his minister
to god the widow’s champion and defence
thou goest to coventry there to behold our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight
o sit my husband’s wrongs on hereford’s spear that it may enter butcher mowbray’s breast
or if misfortune miss the first career be mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom that they may break his foaming courser’s back and throw the rider headlong in the lists a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
thy sometimes brother’s wife with her companion grief must end her life
sister farewell i must to coventry
as much good stay with thee as go with me
grief boundeth where it falls not with the empty hollowness but weight
i take my leave before i have begun for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
commend me to thy brother edmund york
though this be all do not so quickly go i shall remember more
bid him—ah what — with all good speed at plashy visit me
alack and what shall good old york there see but empty lodgings and unfurnished walls unpeopled offices untrodden stones
and what hear there for welcome but my groans
therefore commend me let him not come there to seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere
desolate desolate will i hence and die
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye
lists set out and a throne
enter the lord marshal and the duke of aumerle
my lord aumerle is harry hereford armed
yea at all points and longs to enter in
the duke of norfolk sprightfully and bold stays but the summons of the appelant’s trumpet
why then the champions are prepared and stay for nothing but his majesty’s approach
enter king richard who takes his seat on his throne gaunt bushy bagot green and others who take their places
a trumpet is sounded and answered by another trumpet within
then enter mowbray in armour defendant preceeded by a herald
marshal demand of yonder champion the cause of his arrival here in arms
ask him his name and orderly proceed to swear him in the justice of his cause
in god’s name and the king’s say who thou art and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms against what man thou com’st and what thy quarrel
speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath as so defend thee heaven and thy valour
my name is thomas mowbray duke of norfolk who hither come engaged by my oath— which god defend a knight should violate — both to defend my loyalty and truth to god my king and my succeeding issue against the duke of hereford that appeals me and by the grace of god and this mine arm to prove him in defending of myself a traitor to my god my king and me and as i truly fight defend me heaven
he takes his seat trumpet sounds
enter bolingbroke appellant in armour preceeded by a herald
marshal ask yonder knight in arms both who he is and why he cometh hither thus plated in habiliments of war and formally according to our law depose him in the justice of his cause
and wherefore com’st thou hither before king richard in his royal lists
speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven
harry of hereford lancaster and derby am i who ready here do stand in arms to prove by god’s grace and my body’s valour in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk that he’s a traitor foul and dangerous to god of heaven king richard and to me
and as i truly fight defend me heaven
on pain of death no person be so bold or daring hardy as to touch the lists except the marshal and such officers appointed to direct these fair designs
lord marshal let me kiss my sovereign’s hand and bow my knee before his majesty
for mowbray and myself are like two men that vow a long and weary pilgrimage then let us take a ceremonious leave and loving farewell of our several friends
the appellant in all duty greets your highness and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave
we will descend and fold him in our arms
cousin of hereford as thy cause is right so be thy fortune in this royal fight
farewell my blood which if today thou shed lament we may but not revenge thee dead
o let no noble eye profane a tear for me if i be gored with mowbray’s spear
as confident as is the falcon’s flight against a bird do i with mowbray fight
my loving lord i take my leave of you
of you my noble cousin lord aumerle not sick although i have to do with death but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
as at english feasts so i regreet the daintiest last to make the end most sweet
o thou the earthly author of my blood whose youthful spirit in me regenerate doth with a twofold vigour lift me up to reach at victory above my head add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers and with thy blessings steel my lance’s point that it may enter mowbray’s waxen coat and furbish new the name of john o’ gaunt even in the lusty haviour of his son
god in thy good cause make thee prosperous
be swift like lightning in the execution and let thy blows doubly redoubled fall like amazing thunder on the casque of thy adverse pernicious enemy
rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live
mine innocence and saint george to thrive
however god or fortune cast my lot there lives or dies true to king richard’s throne a loyal just and upright gentleman
never did captive with a freer heart cast off his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontrolled enfranchisement more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine adversary
most mighty liege and my companion peers take from my mouth the wish of happy years
as gentle and as jocund as to jest go i to fight
securely i espy virtue with valour couched in thine eye
order the trial marshal and begin
the king and the lords return to their seats marshal
harry of hereford lancaster and derby receive thy lance and god defend the right
strong as a tower in hope i cry “amen”
go bear this lance to thomas duke of norfolk
harry of hereford lancaster and derby stands here for god his sovereign and himself on pain to be found false and recreant to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray a traitor to his god his king and him and dares him to set forward to the fight
here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk on pain to be found false and recreant both to defend himself and to approve henry of hereford lancaster and derby to god his sovereign and to him disloyal courageously and with a free desire attending but the signal to begin
sound trumpets and set forward combatants
the king hath thrown his warder down
let them lay by their helmets and their spears and both return back to their chairs again
withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree
a long flourish to the combatants
draw near and list what with our council we have done
you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enriched our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment
this must my comfort be that sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment
norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingness pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile
the hopeless word of “never to return” breathe i against thee upon pain of life
a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlooked for from your highness’ mouth
a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness’ hands
the language i have learnt these forty years my native english now i must forgo and now my tongue’s use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony
within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me
i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now
what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
it boots thee not to be compassionate
after our sentence plaining comes too late
then thus i turn me from my country’s light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night
return again and take an oath with thee
lay on our royal sword your banished hands
swear by the duty that you owe to god— our part therein we banish with yourselves— to keep the oath that we administer you never shall so help you truth and god embrace each other’s love in banishment nor never look upon each other’s face nor never write regreet nor reconcile this louring tempest of your home bred hate nor never by advised purpose meet to plot contrive or complot any ill ’gainst us our state our subjects or our land
and i to keep all this
norfolk so far as to mine enemy by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wandered in the air banished this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banished from this land
confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burden of a guilty soul
if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banished as from hence
but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue
now no way can i stray save back to england all the world’s my way
uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart
thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banished years plucked four away
six frozen winters spent return with welcome home from banishment
how long a time lies in one little word
four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings
i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son’s exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son
why uncle thou hast many years to live
but not a minute king that thou canst give
shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
thy son is banished upon good advice whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave
why at our justice seem’st thou then to lour
things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father
o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild
a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroyed
alas i looked when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong
cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
six years we banish him and he shall go
exit king richard and train aumerle
what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show
my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let me by your side
o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou return’st no greeting to thy friends
i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongue’s office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
thy grief is but thy absence for a time
joy absent grief is present for that time
to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
call it a travel that thou tak’st for pleasure
my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an enforced pilgrimage
the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return
nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love
must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief
all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens
teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity
think not the king did banish thee but thou the king
woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne
go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime
look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou goest not whence thou com’st
suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strewed the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light
o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast
or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer’s heat
o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse
fell sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle more than when it bites but lanceth not the sore
come come my son i’ll bring thee on thy way
had i thy youth and cause i would not stay
then england’s ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
where’er i wander boast of this i can though banished yet a true born englishman
a room in the king’s castle enter king richard green and bagot at one door aumerle at another
we did observe —cousin aumerle how far brought you high hereford on his way
i brought high hereford if you call him so but to the next highway and there i left him
and say what store of parting tears were shed
faith none for me except the northeast wind which then blew bitterly against our faces awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear
what said our cousin when you parted with him
“farewell ” and for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seemed buried in my sorrow’s grave
marry would the word “farewell” have lengthened hours and added years to his short banishment he should have had a volume of farewells but since it would not he had none of me
he is our cousin cousin but ’tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends
ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as ’twere to banish their affects with him
off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee with “thanks my countrymen my loving friends” as were our england in reversion his and he our subjects’ next degree in hope
well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland expedient manage must be made my liege ere further leisure yield them further means for their advantage and your highness’ loss
we will ourself in person to this war
and for our coffers with too great a court and liberal largess are grown somewhat light we are enforced to farm our royal realm the revenue whereof shall furnish us for our affairs in hand
if that come short our substitutes at home shall have blank charters whereto when they shall know what men are rich they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold and send them after to supply our wants for we will make for ireland presently
old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord suddenly taken and hath sent poste haste to entreat your majesty to visit him
now put it god in his physician’s mind to help him to his grave immediately
the lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these irish wars
come gentlemen let’s all go visit him
pray god we may make haste and come too late
exeunt act ii scene i london
gaunt on a couch the duke of york and others standing by him
will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath for all in vain comes counsel to his ear
o but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony
where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
he that no more must say is listened more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
more are men’s ends marked than their lives before
the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past
though richard my life’s counsel would not hear my death’s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
no it is stopped with other flattering sounds as praises of whose state the wise are fond lascivious metres to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity— so it be new there’s no respect how vile— that is not quickly buzzed into his ears
then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard
direct not him whose way himself will choose
’tis breath thou lack’st and that breath wilt thou lose
methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last for violent fires soon burn out themselves small showers last long but sudden storms are short he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
light vanity insatiate cormorant consuming means soon preys upon itself
england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of wat’ry neptune is now bound in with shame with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds that england that was wont to conquer others hath made a shameful conquest of itself
ah would the scandal vanish with my life how happy then were my ensuing death
enter king richard and queen aumerle bushy green bagot ross and willoughby
deal mildly with his youth for young hot colts being raged do rage the more
how fares our noble uncle lancaster
o how that name befits my composition
old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
for sleeping england long time have i watched watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon is my strict fast—i mean my children’s looks and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
can sick men play so nicely with their names
no misery makes sport to mock itself
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me i mock my name great king to flatter thee
should dying men flatter with those that live
no no men living flatter those that die
thou now a dying sayest thou flatterest me
o no thou diest though i the sicker be
i am in health i breathe and see thee ill gaunt
now he that made me knows i see thee ill ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill thy death bed is no lesser than thy land wherein thou liest in reputation sick and thou too careless patient as thou art committ’st thy anointed body to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown whose compass is no bigger than thy head and yet encaged in so small a verge the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
o had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame deposing thee before thou wert possessed which art possessed now to depose thyself
why cousin wert thou regent of the world it were a shame to let this land by lease but for thy world enjoying but this land is it not more than shame to shame it so
landlord of england art thou now not king
thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou— king richard
a lunatic lean witted fool presuming on an ague’s privilege darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood with fury from his native residence
now by my seat’s right royal majesty wert thou not brother to great edward’s son this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
spare me not my brother edward’s son for that i was his father edward’s son
that blood already like the pelican hast thou tapped out and drunkenly caroused
my brother gloucester plain well meaning soul whom fair befall in heaven ’mongst happy souls — may be a precedent and witness good that thou respect’st not spilling edward’s blood
join with the present sickness that i have and thy unkindness be like crooked age to crop at once a too long withered flower
live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
these words hereafter thy tormentors be
convey me to my bed then to my grave
love they to live that love and honour have
exit borne off by his attendants king richard
and let them die that age and sullens have for both hast thou and both become the grave
i do beseech your majesty impute his words to wayward sickliness and age in him
he loves you on my life and holds you dear as harry duke of hereford were he here
right you say true as hereford’s love so his as theirs so mine and all be as it is
my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty
his tongue is now a stringless instrument words life and all old lancaster hath spent
be york the next that must be bankrupt so
though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
now for our irish wars we must supplant those rough rug headed kerns which live like venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live
and for these great affairs do ask some charge towards our assistance we do seize to us the plate coin revenues and moveables whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possessed
how long shall i be patient
ah how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
not gloucester’s death nor hereford’s banishment nor gaunt’s rebukes nor england’s private wrongs nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke about his marriage nor my own disgrace have ever made me sour my patient cheek or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face
i am the last of noble edward’s sons of whom thy father prince of wales was first
in war was never lion raged more fierce in peace was never gentle lamb more mild than was that young and princely gentleman
his face thou hast for even so looked he accomplished with the number of thy hours but when he frowned it was against the french and not against his friends
his noble hand did win what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant father’s hand had won
his hands were guilty of no kindred’s blood but bloody with the enemies of his kin
york is too far gone with grief or else he never would compare between
pardon me if you please if not i pleased not to be pardoned am content withal
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands the royalties and rights of banished hereford
did not the one deserve to have an heir
is not his heir a well deserving son
take hereford’s rights away and take from time his charters and his customary rights let not tomorrow then ensue today be not thyself for how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession
now afore god—god forbid i say true — if you do wrongfully seize hereford’s rights call in the letters patents that he hath by his attorneys general to sue his livery and deny his offered homage you pluck a thousand dangers on your head you lose a thousand well disposed hearts and prick my tender patience to those thoughts which honour and allegiance cannot think
think what you will we seize into our hands his plate his goods his money and his lands
i’ll not be by the while
what will ensue hereof there’s none can tell but by bad courses may be understood that their events can never fall out good
go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight
bid him repair to us to ely house to see this business
tomorrow next we will for ireland and ’tis time i trow
and we create in absence of ourself our uncle york lord governor of england for he is just and always loved us well
tomorrow must we part be merry for our time of stay is short
exeunt king queen bushy aumerle green and bagot northumberland
well lords the duke of lancaster is dead
and living too for now his son is duke
barely in title not in revenues
richly in both if justice had her right
my heart is great but it must break with silence ere’t be disburdened with a liberal tongue
nay speak thy mind and let him ne’er speak more that speaks thy words again to do thee harm
tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford
if it be so out with it boldly man
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
no good at all that i can do for him unless you call it good to pity him bereft and gelded of his patrimony
now afore god ’tis shame such wrongs are borne in him a royal prince and many moe of noble blood in this declining land
the king is not himself but basely led by flatterers and what they will inform merely in hate ’gainst any of us all that will the king severely prosecute ’gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
the commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes and quite lost their hearts
the nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
and daily new exactions are devised as blanks benevolences and i wot not what
but what i’ god’s name doth become of this
wars hath not wasted it for warred he hath not but basely yielded upon compromise that which his ancestors achieved with blows
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars
the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm
the king’s grown bankrupt like a broken man
reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
he hath not money for these irish wars his burdenous taxations notwithstanding but by the robbing of the banished duke
but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish
we see the very wrack that we must suffer and unavoided is the danger now for suffering so the causes of our wrack
even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is
nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
we three are but thyself and speaking so thy words are but as thoughts
then thus i have from le port blanc a bay in brittany received intelligence that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham that late broke from the duke of exeter his brother archbishop late of canterbury sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis coint all these well furnished by the duke of brittany with eight tall ships three thousand men of war are making hither with all due expedience and shortly mean to touch our northern shore
perhaps they had ere this but that they stay the first departing of the king for ireland
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke imp out our drooping country’s broken wing redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre’s gilt and make high majesty look like itself away with me in post to ravenspurgh
but if you faint as fearing to do so stay and be secret and myself will go
urge doubts to them that fear
hold out my horse and i will first be there
madam your majesty is too much sad
you promised when you parted with the king to lay aside life harming heaviness and entertain a cheerful disposition
to please the king i did to please myself i cannot do it
yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard
yet again methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune’s womb is coming towards me and my inward soul with nothing trembles
at something it grieves more than with parting from my lord the king
each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which shows like grief itself but is not so for sorrow’s eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form
so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lord’s departure find shapes of grief more than himself to wail which looked on as it is is naught but shadows of what it is not
then thrice gracious queen more than your lord’s departure weep not
more is not seen or if it be ’tis with false sorrow’s eye which for things true weeps things imaginary
it may be so but yet my inward soul persuades me it is otherwise
howe’er it be i cannot but be sad—so heavy sad as thought in thinking on no thought i think makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
’tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
conceit is still derived from some forefather grief
mine is not so for nothing hath begot my something grief or something hath the nothing that i grieve
’tis in reversion that i do possess but what it is that is not yet known what i cannot name
i hope the king is not yet shipped for ireland
’tis better hope he is for his designs crave haste his haste good hope
then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipped
that he our hope might have retired his power and driven into despair an enemy’s hope who strongly hath set footing in this land
the banished bolingbroke repeals himself and with uplifted arms is safe arrived at ravenspurgh
ah madam ’tis too true and that is worse the lord northumberland his son young harry percy the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby with all their powerful friends are fled to him
why have you not proclaimed northumberland and all the rest revolted faction traitors
we have whereupon the earl of worcester hath broken his staff resigned his stewardship and all the household servants fled with him to bolingbroke
so green thou art the midwife to my woe and bolingbroke my sorrow’s dismal heir
now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy and i a gasping new delivered mother have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joined
i will despair and be at enmity with cozening hope
he is a flatterer a parasite a keeper back of death who gently would dissolve the bands of life which false hope lingers in extremity
here comes the duke of york
with signs of war about his aged neck
full of careful business are his looks
uncle for god’s sake speak comfortable words
should i do so i should belie my thoughts
comfort’s in heaven and we are on the earth where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
your husband he is gone to save far off whilst others come to make him lose at home
here am i left to underprop his land who weak with age cannot support myself
now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made now shall he try his friends that flattered him
my lord your son was gone before i came
go all which way it will
the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold and will i fear revolt on hereford’s side
sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester bid her send me presently a thousand pound
my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship today as i came by i called there— but i shall grieve you to report the rest
an hour before i came the duchess died
god for his mercy what a tide of woes comes rushing on this woeful land at once
i know not what to do
i would to god so my untruth had not provoked him to it the king had cut off my head with my brother’s
what are there no posts dispatched for ireland
how shall we do for money for these wars
come sister—cousin i would say pray pardon me
go fellow get thee home provide some carts and bring away the armour that is there
exit servingman gentlemen will you go muster men
if i know how or which way to order these affairs thus disorderly thrust into my hands never believe me
th’ one is my sovereign whom both my oath and duty bids defend th’ other again is my kinsman whom the king hath wronged whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
come cousin i’ll dispose of you
gentlemen go muster up your men and meet me presently at berkeley castle
i should to plashy too but time will not permit
all is uneven and everything is left at six and seven
the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland but none returns
for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible
besides our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king
and that is the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
wherein the king stands generally condemned
if judgment lie in them then so do we because we ever have been near the king
well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle
the earl of wiltshire is already there
thither will i with you for little office will the hateful commons perform for us except like curs to tear us all to pieces
will you go along with us
no i will to ireland to his majesty
if heart’s presages be not vain we three here part that ne’er shall meet again
that’s as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke
the task he undertakes is numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry
where one on his side fights thousands will fly
farewell at once for once for all and ever
enter bolingbroke and northumberland with forces
how far is it my lord to berkeley now
believe me noble lord i am a stranger here in gloucestershire
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable
but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotshall will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel
but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoyed
by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company
of much less value is my company than your good words
it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever
i had thought my lord to have learned his health of you
why is he not with the queen
he hath forsook the court broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king
he was not so resolved when last we spake together
because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh to offer service to the duke of hereford and sent me over by berkeley to discover what power the duke of york had levied there then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh
have you forgot the duke of hereford boy
no my good lord for that is not forgot which ne’er i did remember
to my knowledge i never in my life did look on him
then learn to know him now
my gracious lord i tender you my service such as it is being tender raw and young which elder days shall ripen and confirm to more approved service and desert
i thank thee gentle percy and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul rememb’ring my good friends and as my fortune ripens with thy love it shall be still thy true love’s recompense
my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
how far is it to berkeley and what stir keeps good old york there with his men of war
there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees manned with three hundred men as i have heard
and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour none else of name and noble estimate
here come the lords of ross and willoughby bloody with spurring fiery red with haste
i wot your love pursues a banished traitor
all my treasury is yet but unfelt thanks which more enriched shall be your love and labour’s recompense
your presence makes us rich most noble lord
and far surmounts our labour to attain it
evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor which till my infant fortune comes to years stands for my bounty
it is my lord of berkeley as i guess
my lord of hereford my message is to you
my lord my answer is—to “lancaster” and i am come to seek that name in england and i must find that title in your tongue before i make reply to aught you say
mistake me not my lord ’tis not my meaning to rase one title of your honour out
to you my lord i come what lord you will from the most gracious regent of this land the duke of york to know what pricks you on to take advantage of the absent time and fright our native peace with self borne arms
i shall not need transport my words by you
here comes his grace in person
show me thy humble heart and not thy knee whose duty is deceivable and false
grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
i am no traitor’s uncle and that word “grace” in an ungracious mouth is but profane
why have those banished and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of england’s ground
but then more why why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom frighting her pale faced villages with war and ostentation of despised arms
com’st thou because the anointed king is hence
why foolish boy the king is left behind and in my loyal bosom lies his power
were i but now lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt thy father and myself rescued the black prince that young mars of men from forth the ranks of many thousand french o then how quickly should this arm of mine now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault
my gracious uncle let me know my fault
on what condition stands it and wherein
even in condition of the worst degree in gross rebellion and detested treason
thou art a banished man and here art come before the expiration of thy time in braving arms against thy sovereign
as i was banished i was banished hereford but as i come i come for lancaster
and noble uncle i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
you are my father for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive
o then my father will you permit that i shall stand condemned a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties plucked from my arms perforce and given away to upstart unthrifts
if that my cousin king be king in england it must be granted i am duke of lancaster
you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
had you first died and he been thus trod down he should have found his uncle gaunt a father to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
i am denied to sue my livery here and yet my letters patents give me leave
my father’s goods are all distrained and sold and these and all are all amiss employed
what would you have me do
i am a subject and challenge law
attorneys are denied me and therefore personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent
the noble duke hath been too much abused
it stands your grace upon to do him right
base men by his endowments are made great
my lords of england let me tell you this i have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs and laboured all i could to do him right
but in this kind to come in braving arms be his own carver and cut out his way to find out right with wrong it may not be
and you that do abet him in this kind cherish rebellion and are rebels all
the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid and let him never see joy that breaks that oath
well well i see the issue of these arms
i cannot mend it i must needs confess because my power is weak and all ill left but if i could by him that gave me life i would attach you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king
but since i cannot be it known unto you i do remain as neuter
so fare you well— unless you please to enter in the castle and there repose you for this night
an offer uncle that we will accept but we must win your grace to go with us to bristol castle which they say is held by bushy bagot and their complices the caterpillars of the commonwealth which i have sworn to weed and pluck away
it may be i will go with you but yet i’ll pause for i am loath to break our country’s laws
nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
things past redress are now with me past care
enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain
my lord of salisbury we have stayed ten days and hardly kept our countrymen together and yet we hear no tidings from the king
stay yet another day thou trusty welshman
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee
’tis thought the king is dead
the bay trees in our country are all withered and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven the pale faced moon looks bloody on the earth and lean looked prophets whisper fearful change rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap the one in fear to lose what they enjoy the other to enjoy by rage and war
these signs forerun the death or fall of kings
our countrymen are gone and fled as well assured richard their king is dead
with the eyes of heavy mind i see thy glory like a shooting star fall to the base earth from the firmament
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes and crossly to thy good all fortune goes
exit act iii scene i bristol
enter bolingbroke york northumberland harry percy willoughby ross officers behind with bushy and green prisoners
bushy and green i will not vex your souls— since presently your souls must part your bodies— with too much urging your pernicious lives for ’twere no charity yet to wash your blood from off my hands here in the view of men i will unfold some causes of your deaths you have misled a prince a royal king a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments by you unhappied and disfigured clean
you have in manner with your sinful hours made a divorce betwixt his queen and him broke the possession of a royal bed and stained the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
myself a prince by fortune of my birth near to the king in blood and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me have stooped my neck under your injuries and sighed my english breath in foreign clouds eating the bitter bread of banishment whilst you have fed upon my signories disparked my parks and felled my forest woods from my own windows torn my household coat rased out my imprese leaving me no sign save men’s opinions and my living blood to show the world i am a gentleman
this and much more much more than twice all this condemns you to the death
see them delivered over to execution and the hand of death
more welcome is the stroke of death to me than bolingbroke to england
my comfort is that heaven will take our souls and plague injustice with the pains of hell
my lord northumberland see them dispatched
exeunt northumberland and others with bushy and green uncle you say the queen is at your house for god’s sake fairly let her be entreated
tell her i send to her my kind commends take special care my greetings be delivered
a gentleman of mine i have dispatched with letters of your love to her at large
come lords away to fight with glendower and his complices
a while to work and after holiday
enter king richard the bishop of carlisle aumerle and soldiers
barkloughly castle call they this at hand
how brooks your grace the air after your late tossing on the breaking seas
needs must i like it well
i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again
dear earth i do salute thee with my hand though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs
as a long parted mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands
feed not thy sovereign’s foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavy gaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee
yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies
mock not my senseless conjuration lords
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms
that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all
the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we will not
heaven’s offer we refuse the proffered means of succour and redress
he means my lord that we are too remiss whilst bolingbroke through our security grows strong and great in substance and in power
discomfortable cousin know’st thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being plucked from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revelled in the night whilst we were wand’ring with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but self affrighted tremble at his sin
not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord
for every man that bolingbroke hath pressed to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel
then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
how far off lies your power
nor near nor farther off my gracious lord than this weak arm
discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair
one day too late i fear me noble lord hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
o call back yesterday bid time return and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
today today unhappy day too late o’erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled
why looks your grace so pale
but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face and they are fled and till so much blood thither come again have i not reason to look pale and dead
all souls that will be safe fly from my side for time hath set a blot upon my pride
is not the king’s name twenty thousand names
a puny subject strikes at thy great glory
look not to the ground ye favourites of a king
i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn
more health and happiness betide my liege than can my care tuned tongue deliver him
mine ear is open and my heart prepared
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
why ’twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
if he serve god we’ll serve him too and be his fellow so
they break their faith to god as well as us
cry woe destruction ruin loss decay
the worst is death and death will have his day
glad am i that your highness is so armed to bear the tidings of calamity
like an unseasonable stormy day which makes the silver rivers drown their shores as if the world were all dissolved to tears so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
whitebeards have armed their thin and hairless scalps against thy majesty boys with women’s voices strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of double fatal yew against thy state yea distaff women manage rusty bills against thy seat
both young and old rebel and all goes worse than i have power to tell
too well too well thou tell’st a tale so ill where is the earl of wiltshire
that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps
if we prevail their heads shall pay for it
i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke
peace have they made with him indeed my lord
o villains vipers damned without redemption
dogs easily won to fawn on any man
snakes in my heart blood warmed that sting my heart
three judases each one thrice worse than judas
terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this
sweet love i see changing his property turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
their peace is made with heads and not with hands
those whom you curse have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound and lie full low graved in the hollow ground
is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
ay all of them at bristol lost their heads
where is the duke my father with his power
let’s talk of graves of worms and epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
let’s choose executors and talk of wills
and yet not so for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground
our lands our lives and all are bolingbroke’s and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones
for god’s sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings— how some have been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed all murdered
for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humoured thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall and farewell king
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence
throw away respect tradition form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while
i live with bread like you feel want taste grief need friends
subjected thus how can you say to me i am a king
my lord wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes but presently prevent the ways to wail
to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength gives in your weakness strength unto your foe and so your follies fight against yourself
fear and be slain—no worse can come to fight and fight and die is death destroying death where fearing dying pays death servile breath
enquire of him and learn to make a body of a limb
proud bolingbroke i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom
this ague fit of fear is overblown an easy task it is to win our own
say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
men judge by the complexion of the sky the state in inclination of the day so may you by my dull and heavy eye
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
i play the torturer by small and small to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken your uncle york is joined with bolingbroke and all your northern castles yielded up and all your southern gentlemen in arms upon his party
beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth of that sweet way i was in to despair
by heaven i’ll hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort any more
there i’ll pine away a king woe’s slave shall kingly woe obey
that power i have discharge and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow for i have none
let no man speak again to alter this for counsel is but vain
he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
let them hence away from richard’s night to bolingbroke’s fair day
enter with drum and colours bolingbroke and forces northumberland and others
so that by this intelligence we learn the welshmen are dispersed and salisbury is gone to meet the king who lately landed with some few private friends upon this coast
the news is very fair and good my lord richard not far from hence hath hid his head
it would beseem the lord northumberland to say “king richard”
alack the heavy day when such a sacred king should hide his head
your grace mistakes only to be brief left i his title out
the time hath been would you have been so brief with him he would have been so brief with you to shorten you for taking so the head your whole head’s length
mistake not uncle further than you should
take not good cousin further than you should lest you mistake
the heavens are o’er our heads
i know it uncle and oppose not myself against their will
what will not this castle yield
the castle royally is manned my lord against thy entrance
yes my good lord it doth contain a king
king richard lies within the limits of yon lime and stone and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman of holy reverence—who i cannot learn
o belike it is the bishop of carlisle
noble lord go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley into his ruined ears and thus deliver henry bolingbroke on both his knees doth kiss king richard’s hand and sends allegiance and true faith of heart to his most royal person hither come even at his feet to lay my arms and power provided that my banishment repealed and lands restored again be freely granted
if not i’ll use the advantage of my power and lay the summer’s dust with showers of blood rained from the wounds of slaughtered englishmen— the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke it is such crimson tempest should bedrench the fresh green lap of fair king richard’s land my stooping duty tenderly shall show
go signify as much while here we march upon the grassy carpet of this plain
let’s march without the noise of threat’ning drum that from this castle’s tottered battlements our fair appointments may be well perused
methinks king richard and myself should meet with no less terror than the elements of fire and water when their thund’ring shock at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
be he the fire i’ll be the yielding water the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain my waters—on the earth and not on him
march on and mark king richard how he looks
a parley sounded and answered by a trumpet within
enter on the walls the king the bishop of carlisle aumerle scroop and salisbury see see king richard doth himself appear as doth the blushing discontented sun from out the fiery portal of the east when he perceives the envious clouds are bent to dim his glory and to stain the track of his bright passage to the occident
yet he looks like a king
behold his eye as bright as is the eagle’s lightens forth controlling majesty
alack alack for woe that any harm should stain so fair a show
to northumberland we are amazed and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee because we thought ourself thy lawful king
and if we be how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence
if we be not show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship for well we know no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre unless he do profane steal or usurp
and though you think that all as you have done have torn their souls by turning them from us and we are barren and bereft of friends yet know my master god omnipotent is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown
tell bolingbroke—for yon methinks he stands— that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason
he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war but ere the crown he looks for live in peace ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers’ sons shall ill become the flower of england’s face change the complexion of her maid pale peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures’ grass with faithful english blood
the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil and uncivil arms be rushed upon
this swears he as he is a prince and just and as i am a gentleman i credit him
northumberland say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplished without contradiction
with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
northumberland returns to bolingbroke to aumerle
we do debase ourselves cousin do we not to look so poorly and to speak so fair
shall we call back northumberland and send defiance to the traitor and so die
let’s fight with gentle words till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
o god o god that e’er this tongue of mine that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man should take it off again with words of sooth
o that i were as great as is my grief or lesser than my name or that i could forget what i have been or not remember what i must be now
i’ll give thee scope to beat since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
what must the king do now
must he lose the name of king
i’ god’s name let it go
aumerle thou weep’st my tender hearted cousin
we’ll make foul weather with despised tears our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn and make a dearth in this revolting land
or shall we play the wantons with our woes and make some pretty match with shedding tears
as thus to drop them still upon one place till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth and therein laid there lies two kinsmen digged their graves with weeping eyes
would not this ill do well
well well i see i talk but idly and you laugh at me
most mighty prince my lord northumberland what says king bolingbroke
will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die
you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay
my lord in the base court he doth attend to speak with you
may it please you to come down
down down i come like glist’ring phaëthon wanting the manage of unruly jades
base court where kings grow base to come at traitors’ calls and do them grace
for night owls shriek where mounting larks should sing
sorrow and grief of heart makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
enter king richard and his attendants
stand all apart and show fair duty to his majesty
fair cousin you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it
me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy
your heart is up i know thus high at least although your knee be low
my gracious lord i come but for mine own
your own is yours and i am yours and all
so far be mine my most redoubted lord as my true service shall deserve your love
they well deserve to have that know the strong’st and surest way to get
tears show their love but want their remedies
cousin i am too young to be your father though you are old enough to be my heir
what you will have i’ll give and willing too for do we must what force will have us do
set on towards london cousin is it so
then i must not say no
enter the queen and two ladies
what sport shall we devise here in this garden to drive away the heavy thought of care
’twill make me think the world is full of rubs and that my fortune runs against the bias
my legs can keep no measure in delight when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
therefore no dancing girl some other sport
for if of joy being altogether wanting it doth remember me the more of sorrow or if of grief being altogether had it adds more sorrow to my want of joy
for what i have i need not to repeat and what i want it boots not to complain
’tis well that thou hast cause but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
i could weep madam would it do you good
and i could sing would weeping do me good and never borrow any tear of thee
but stay here come the gardeners
let’s step into the shadow of these trees
my wretchedness unto a row of pins they will talk of state for everyone doth so against a change woe is forerun with woe
queen and ladies retire enter a gardener and two servants
go bind thou up young dangling apricocks which like unruly children make their sire stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
give some supportance to the bending twigs
go thou and like an executioner cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays that look too lofty in our commonwealth
all must be even in our government
you thus employed i will go root away the noisome weeds which without profit suck the soil’s fertility from wholesome flowers
why should we in the compass of a pale keep law and form and due proportion showing as in a model our firm estate when our sea walled garden the whole land is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up her fruit trees all unpruned her hedges ruined her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs swarming with caterpillars
he that hath suffered this disordered spring hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
the weeds which his broad spreading leaves did shelter that seemed in eating him to hold him up are plucked up root and all by bolingbroke— i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
and bolingbroke hath seized the wasteful king
o what pity is it that he had not so trimmed and dressed his land as we this garden
we at time of year do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees lest being over proud in sap and blood with too much riches it confound itself
had he done so to great and growing men they might have lived to bear and he to taste their fruits of duty
superfluous branches we lop away that bearing boughs may live
had he done so himself had home the crown which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
what think you the king shall be deposed
depressed he is already and deposed ’tis doubt he will be
letters came last night to a dear friend of the good duke of york’s that tell black tidings
o i am pressed to death through want of speaking
coming forward thou old adam’s likeness set to dress this garden how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
what eve what serpent hath suggested thee to make a second fall of cursed man
why dost thou say king richard is deposed
dar’st thou thou little better thing than earth divine his downfall
say where when and how cam’st thou by this ill tidings
little joy have i to breathe this news yet what i say is true
king richard he is in the mighty hold of bolingbroke
in your lord’s scale is nothing but himself and some few vanities that make him light but in the balance of great bolingbroke besides himself are all the english peers and with that odds he weighs king richard down
post you to london and you will find it so
i speak no more than everyone doth know
nimble mischance that art so light of foot doth not thy embassage belong to me and am i last that knows it
o thou thinkest to serve me last that i may longest keep thy sorrow in my breast
come ladies go to meet at london london’s king in woe
what was i born to this that my sad look should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
gard’ner for telling me these news of woe pray god the plants thou graft’st may never grow
poor queen so that thy state might be no worse i would my skill were subject to thy curse
here did she fall a tear
here in this place i’ll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace
rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen in the remembrance of a weeping queen
exeunt act iv scene i westminster hall
the lords spiritual on the right side of the throne the lords temporal on the left the commons below
enter bolingbroke aumerle surrey northumberland harry percy fitzwater another lord the bishop of carlisle the abbot of westminster and attendants
now bagot freely speak thy mind what thou dost know of noble gloucester’s death who wrought it with the king and who performed the bloody office of his timeless end
then set before my face the lord aumerle
cousin stand forth and look upon that man
my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue scorns to unsay what once it hath delivered
in that dead time when gloucester’s death was plotted i heard you say “is not my arm of length that reacheth from the restful english court as far as calais to mine uncle’s head ” amongst much other talk that very time i heard you say that you had rather refuse the offer of an hundred thousand crowns than bolingbroke’s return to england adding withal how blest this land would be in this your cousin’s death
princes and noble lords what answer shall i make to this base man
shall i so much dishonour my fair stars on equal terms to give him chastisement
either i must or have mine honour soiled with the attainder of his slanderous lips
there is my gage the manual seal of death that marks thee out for hell
i say thou liest and will maintain what thou hast said is false in thy heart blood though being all too base to stain the temper of my knightly sword
thou shalt not take it up
excepting one i would he were the best in all this presence that hath moved me so
if that thy valour stand on sympathy there is my gage aumerle in gage to thine
by that fair sun which shows me where thou stand’st i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spak’st it that thou wert cause of noble gloucester’s death
if thou deniest it twenty times thou liest
and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart where it was forged with my rapier’s point
thou dar’st not coward live to see that day
now by my soul i would it were this hour
fitzwater thou art damned to hell for this
his honour is as true in this appeal as thou art an unjust and that thou art so there i throw my gage to prove it on thee to the extremest point of mortal breathing
and if i do not may my hands rot off and never brandish more revengeful steel over the glittering helmet of my foe
i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle and spur thee on with full as many lies as may be holloaed in thy treacherous ear from sun to sun
engage it to the trial if thou dar’st
by heaven i’ll throw at all
i have a thousand spirits in one breast to answer twenty thousand such as you
my lord fitzwater i do remember well the very time aumerle and you did talk
you were in presence then and you can witness with me this is true
as false by heaven as heaven itself is true
that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword that it shall render vengeance and revenge till thou the lie giver and that lie do lie in earth as quiet as thy father’s skull
in proof whereof there is my honour’s pawn
engage it to the trial if thou dar’st
how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live i dare meet surrey in a wilderness and spit upon him whilst i say he lies and lies and lies
there is my bond of faith to tie thee to my strong correction
as i intend to thrive in this new world aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
besides i heard the banished norfolk say that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men to execute the noble duke at calais
some honest christian trust me with a gage
that norfolk lies here do i throw down this if he may be repealed to try his honour
these differences shall all rest under gage till norfolk be repealed
repealed he shall be and though mine enemy restored again to all his lands and signories
when he is returned against aumerle we will enforce his trial
that honourable day shall ne’er be seen
many a time hath banished norfolk fought for jesu christ in glorious christian field streaming the ensign of the christian cross against black pagans turks and saracens and toiled with works of war retired himself to italy and there at venice gave his body to that pleasant country’s earth and his pure soul unto his captain christ under whose colours he had fought so long
as surely as i live my lord
sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom of good old abraham
lords appellants your differences shall all rest under gage till we assign you to your days of trial
great duke of lancaster i come to thee from plume plucked richard who with willing soul adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields to the possession of thy royal hand
ascend his throne descending now from him and long live henry of that name the fourth
in god’s name i’ll ascend the regal throne
worst in this royal presence may i speak yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
would god that any in this noble presence were enough noble to be upright judge of noble richard
then true noblesse would learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
what subject can give sentence on his king
and who sits here that is not richard’s subject
thieves are not judged but they are by to hear although apparent guilt be seen in them and shall the figure of god’s majesty his captain steward deputy elect anointed crowned planted many years be judged by subject and inferior breath and he himself not present
o forfend it god that in a christian climate souls refined should show so heinous black obscene a deed
i speak to subjects and a subject speaks stirred up by god thus boldly for his king
my lord of hereford here whom you call king is a foul traitor to proud hereford’s king
and if you crown him let me prophesy the blood of english shall manure the ground and future ages groan for this foul act
peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
disorder horror fear and mutiny shall here inhabit and this land be called the field of golgotha and dead men’s skulls
o if you raise this house against this house it will the woefullest division prove that ever fell upon this cursed earth
prevent it resist it let it not be so lest child child’s children cry against you “woe ” northumberland
well have you argued sir and for your pains of capital treason we arrest you here
my lord of westminster be it your charge to keep him safely till his day of trial
may it please you lords to grant the commons’ suit
fetch hither richard that in common view he may surrender
so we shall proceed without suspicion
lords you that here are under our arrest procure your sureties for your days of answer
little are we beholding to your love and little looked for at your helping hands
enter york with king richard and officers bearing the crown c king richard
alack why am i sent for to a king before i have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith i reigned
i hardly yet have learned to insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee
give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission
yet i well remember the favours of these men
did they not sometime cry “all hail ” to me
so judas did to christ but he in twelve found truth in all but one i in twelve thousand none
am i both priest and clerk
god save the king although i be not he and yet amen if heaven do think him me
to do what service am i sent for hither
to do that office of thine own good will which tired majesty did make thee offer the resignation of thy state and crown to henry bolingbroke
here cousin on this side my hand and on that side thine
now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets filling one another the emptier ever dancing in the air the other down unseen and full of water
that bucket down and full of tears am i drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
i thought you had been willing to resign
my crown i am but still my griefs are mine
you may my glories and my state depose but not my griefs still am i king of those
part of your cares you give me with your crown
your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
my care is loss of care by old care done your care is gain of care by new care won
the cares i give i have though given away they ’tend the crown yet still with me they stay
are you contented to resign the crown
ay no no ay for i must nothing be
therefore no “no” for i resign to thee
now mark me how i will undo myself i give this heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand the pride of kingly sway from out my heart with mine own tears i wash away my balm with mine own hands i give away my crown with mine own tongue deny my sacred state with mine own breath release all duteous oaths
all pomp and majesty i do forswear my manors rents revenues i forgo my acts decrees and statutes i deny
god pardon all oaths that are broke to me god keep all vows unbroke are made to thee
make me that nothing have with nothing grieved and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved
long mayst thou live in richard’s seat to sit and soon lie richard in an earthly pit
god save king henry unkinged richard says and send him many years of sunshine days
no more but that you read these accusations and these grievous crimes committed by your person and your followers against the state and profit of this land that by confessing them the souls of men may deem that you are worthily deposed
and must i ravel out my weaved up follies
gentle northumberland if thy offences were upon record would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them
if thou wouldst there shouldst thou find one heinous article containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath marked with a blot damned in the book of heaven
nay all of you that stand and look upon me whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity yet you pilates have here delivered me to my sour cross and water cannot wash away your sin
mine eyes are full of tears i cannot see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here
nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself i find myself a traitor with the rest for i have given here my soul’s consent t’ undeck the pompous body of a king made glory base and sovereignty a slave proud majesty a subject state a peasant
no lord of thine thou haught insulting man nor no man’s lord
i have no name no title no not that name was given me at the font but ’tis usurped
that i have worn so many winters out and know not now what name to call myself
o that i were a mockery king of snow standing before the sun of bolingbroke to melt myself away in water drops
good king great king and yet not greatly good an if my word be sterling yet in england let it command a mirror hither straight that it may show me what a face i have since it is bankrupt of his majesty
go some of you and fetch a looking glass
read o’er this paper while the glass doth come
fiend thou torments me ere i come to hell
urge it no more my lord northumberland
the commons will not then be satisfied
i’ll read enough when i do see the very book indeed where all my sins are writ and that’s myself
give me that glass and therein will i read
hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine and made no deeper wounds
o flatt’ring glass like to my followers in prosperity thou dost beguile me
was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men
was this the face that like the sun did make beholders wink
is this the face which faced so many follies that was at last outfaced by bolingbroke
a brittle glory shineth in this face
as brittle as the glory is the face
dashes the glass against the ground for there it is cracked in an hundred shivers
mark silent king the moral of this sport how soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face
the shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed the shadow of your face
’tis very true my grief lies all within and these external manner of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul
and i thank thee king for thy great bounty that not only giv’st me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause
i’ll beg one boon and then be gone and trouble you no more
i am greater than a king for when i was a king my flatterers were then but subjects
being now a subject i have a king here to my flatterer
being so great i have no need to beg
then give me leave to go
whither you will so i were from your sights
go some of you convey him to the tower
conveyers are you all that rise thus nimbly by a true king’s fall
exeunt king richard and guard bolingbroke
on wednesday next we solemnly set down our coronation
exeunt all but the bishop of carlisle the abbot of westminster and aumerle abbot
a woeful pageant have we here beheld
the children yet unborn shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
you holy clergymen is there no plot to rid the realm of this pernicious blot
my lord before i freely speak my mind herein you shall not only take the sacrament to bury mine intents but also to effect whatever i shall happen to devise
i see your brows are full of discontent your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
come home with me to supper
i will lay a plot shall show us all a merry day
exeunt act v scene i london
a street leading to the tower
this way the king will come
this is the way to julius caesar’s ill erected tower to whose flint bosom my condemned lord is doomed a prisoner by proud bolingbroke
here let us rest if this rebellious earth have any resting for her true king’s queen
but soft but see or rather do not see my fair rose wither yet look up behold that you in pity may dissolve to dew and wash him fresh again with true love tears
ah thou the model where old troy did stand thou map of honour thou king richard’s tomb and not king richard
thou most beauteous inn why should hard favoured grief be lodged in thee when triumph is become an alehouse guest
join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden
learn good soul to think our former state a happy dream from which awaked the truth of what we are shows us but this
i am sworn brother sweet to grim necessity and he and i will keep a league till death
hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house
our holy lives must win a new world’s crown which our profane hours here have thrown down
what is my richard both in shape and mind transformed and weakened
hath he been in thy heart
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage to be o’erpowered and wilt thou pupil like take the correction mildly kiss the rod and fawn on rage with base humility which art a lion and the king of beasts
if aught but beasts i had been still a happy king of men
good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for france
think i am dead and that even here thou tak’st as from my death bed thy last living leave
in winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds
for why the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out and some will mourn in ashes some coal black for the deposing of a rightful king
my lord the mind of bolingbroke is changed
you must to pomfret not unto the tower
and madam there is order ta’en for you with all swift speed you must away to france
northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption
thou shalt think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all
and he shall think that thou which knowst the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being ne’er so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
the love of wicked men converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserved death
my guilt be on my head and there an end
take leave and part for you must part forthwith
bad men you violate a twofold marriage ’twixt my crown and me and then betwixt me and my married wife
let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me and yet not so for with a kiss ’twas made
part us northumberland i towards the north where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime my wife to france from whence set forth in pomp she came adorned hither like sweet may sent back like hallowmas or short’st of day
ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
banish us both and send the king with me
that were some love but little policy
then whither he goes thither let me go
so two together weeping make one woe
weep thou for me in france i for thee here better far off than near be ne’er the near
go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans
so longest way shall have the longest moans
twice for one step i’ll groan the way being short and piece the way out with a heavy heart
come come in wooing sorrow let’s be brief since wedding it there is such length in grief
one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart
give me mine own again ’twere no good part to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
they kiss again so now i have mine own again be gone that i may strive to kill it with a groan
we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more adieu
a room in the duke of york’s palace
my lord you told me you would tell the rest when weeping made you break the story off of our two cousins’ coming into london
at that sad stop my lord where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops threw dust and rubbish on king richard’s head
then as i said the duke great bolingbroke mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seemed to know with slow but stately pace kept on his course whilst all tongues cried “god save thee bolingbroke ” you would have thought the very windows spake so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once “jesu preserve thee
welcome bolingbroke ” whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steed’s neck bespake them thus “i thank you countrymen ” and thus still doing thus he passed along
as in a theatre the eyes of men after a well graced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt men’s eyes did scowl on gentle richard
no man cried “god save him ” no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steeled the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him
but heaven hath a hand in these events to whose high will we bound our calm contents
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now whose state and honour i for aye allow
aumerle that was but that is lost for being richard’s friend and madam you must call him rutland now
i am in parliament pledge for his truth and lasting fealty to the new made king
who are the violets now that strew the green lap of the new come spring
madam i know not nor i greatly care not
god knows i had as lief be none as one
well bear you well in this new spring of time lest you be cropped before you come to prime
do these jousts and triumphs hold
for aught i know my lord they do
you will be there i know
if god prevent not i purpose so
what seal is that that hangs without thy bosom
no matter then who see it
i do beseech your grace to pardon me
it is a matter of small consequence which for some reasons i would not have seen
which for some reasons sir i mean to see
’tis nothing but some bond that he is entered into for gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day
what doth he with a bond that he is bound to
boy let me see the writing
i do beseech you pardon me
let me see it i say
snatches it and reads it treason foul treason
what is the matter my lord
god for his mercy what treachery is here
why what is it my lord
give me my boots i say
now by mine honour by my life my troth i will appeach the villain
it is no more than my poor life must answer
never more come in my sight
give me my boots i say
why york what wilt thou do
wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
or are we like to have
is not my teeming date drunk up with time
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age and rob me of a happy mother’s name
thou fond mad woman wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
a dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament and interchangeably set down their hands to kill the king at oxford
he shall be none we’ll keep him here
then what is that to him
were he twenty times my son i would appeach him
hadst thou groaned for him as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect that i have been disloyal to thy bed and that he is a bastard not thy son
sweet york sweet husband be not of that mind
he is as like thee as a man may be not like to me or any of my kin and yet i love him
spur post and get before him to the king and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
though i be old i doubt not but to ride as fast as york
and never will i rise up from the ground till bolingbroke have pardoned thee
enter bolingbroke as king harry percy and other lords
can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
’tis full three months since i did see him last
if any plague hang over us ’tis he
i would to god my lords he might be found
inquire at london ’mongst the taverns there for there they say he daily doth frequent with unrestrained loose companions even such they say as stand in narrow lanes and beat our watch and rob our passengers while he young wanton and effeminate boy takes on the point of honour to support so dissolute a crew
my lord some two days since i saw the prince and told him of those triumphs held at oxford
his answer was he would unto the stews and from the common’st creature pluck a glove and wear it as a favour and with that he would unhorse the lustiest challenger
yet through both i see some sparks of better hope which elder years may happily bring forth
what means our cousin that he stares and looks so wildly
i do beseech your majesty to have some conference with your grace alone
withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
exeunt harry percy and lords what is the matter with our cousin now
for ever may my knees grow to the earth my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth unless a pardon ere i rise or speak
intended or committed was this fault
if on the first how heinous e’er it be to win thy after love i pardon thee
then give me leave that i may turn the key that no man enter till my tale be done
thou hast a traitor in thy presence there
thou hast no cause to fear
open the door secure foolhardy king
shall i for love speak treason to thy face
open the door or i will break it open
king henry unlocks the door and afterwards relocks it enter york
tell us how near is danger that we may arm us to encounter it
peruse this writing here and thou shalt know the treason that my haste forbids me show
remember as thou read’st thy promise passed
read not my name there my heart is not confederate with my hand
it was villain ere thy hand did set it down
i tore it from the traitor’s bosom king
fear and not love begets his penitence
forget to pity him lest thy pity prove a serpent that will sting thee to the heart
o heinous strong and bold conspiracy
o loyal father of a treacherous son
thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain from whence this stream through muddy passages hath held his current and defiled himself
thy overflow of good converts to bad and thy abundant goodness shall excuse this deadly blot in thy digressing son
so shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd and he shall spend mine honour with his shame as thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies or my shamed life in his dishonour lies
thou kill’st me in his life giving him breath the traitor lives the true man’s put to death
for god’s sake let me in
what shrill voiced suppliant makes this eager cry
a woman and thine aunt great king ’tis i
speak with me pity me open the door
a beggar begs that never begged before
our scene is altered from a serious thing and now changed to “the beggar and the king ” my dangerous cousin let your mother in
i know she’s come to pray for your foul sin
if thou do pardon whosoever pray more sins for this forgiveness prosper may
this festered joint cut off the rest rest sound this let alone will all the rest confound
o king believe not this hard hearted man
love loving not itself none other can
thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
for ever will i walk upon my knees and never see day that the happy sees till thou give joy until thou bid me joy by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
unto my mother’s prayers i bend my knee
against them both my true joints bended be
kneels ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest his words come from his mouth ours from our breast
he prays but faintly and would be denied we pray with heart and soul and all beside his weary joints would gladly rise i know our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy ours of true zeal and deep integrity
our prayers do outpray his then let them have that mercy which true prayer ought to have
nay do not say “stand up”
say “pardon” first and afterwards “stand up”
an if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach “pardon” should be the first word of thy speech
i never longed to hear a word till now
say “pardon ” king let pity teach thee how
the word is short but not so short as sweet no word like “pardon” for kings’ mouths so meet
speak it in french king say “pardonne moy ” duchess
dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
my sour husband my hard hearted lord that sets the word itself against the word
speak “pardon” as ’tis current in our land the chopping french we do not understand
thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce pity may move thee “pardon” to rehearse
i do not sue to stand
pardon is all the suit i have in hand
i pardon him as god shall pardon me
o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
yet am i sick for fear
speak it again twice saying “pardon” doth not pardon twain but makes one pardon strong
with all my heart i pardon him
a god on earth thou art
but for our trusty brother in law and the abbot with all the rest of that consorted crew destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
good uncle help to order several powers to oxford or where’er these traitors are they shall not live within this world i swear but i will have them if i once know where
your mother well hath prayed and prove you true
i pray god make thee new
didst thou not mark the king what words he spake “have i no friend will rid me of this living fear ” was it not so
“have i no friend ” quoth he
he spake it twice and urged it twice together did he not
and speaking it he wishtly looked on me as who should say “i would thou wert the man that would divorce this terror from my heart” meaning the king at pomfret
i am the king’s friend and will rid his foe
i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it
my brain i’ll prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of still breeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humours like the people of this world for no thought is contented
the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixed with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus “come little ones” and then again “it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a needle’s eye ” thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride
thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune’s slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like
thus play i in one person many people and none contented
sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am
then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kinged again and by and by think that i am unkinged by bolingbroke and straight am nothing
but whate’er i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing
how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept
so is it in the music of men’s lives
and here have i the daintiness of ear to check time broke in a disordered string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke
i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numb’ring clock
my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dial’s point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell
so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours
but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke’s proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack o’ the clock
let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for ’tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this all hating world
enter a groom of the stable
the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live
i was a poor groom of thy stable king when thou wert king who travelling towards york with much ado at length have gotten leave to look upon my sometimes royal master’s face
o how it erned my heart when i beheld in london streets that coronation day when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary that horse that thou so often hast bestrid that horse that i so carefully have dressed
tell me gentle friend how went he under him
so proudly as if he disdained the ground
so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back
why do i rail on thee since thou created to be awed by man wast born to bear
i was not made a horse and yet i bear a burden like an ass spurred galled and tired by jauncing bolingbroke
if thou love me ’tis time thou wert away
my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
my lord will’t please you to fall to
taste of it first as thou art wont to do
sir pierce of exton who lately came from the king commands the contrary
the devil take henry of lancaster and thee
patience is stale and i am weary of it
what means death in this rude assault
villain thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument
snatching a weapon and killing one go thou and fill another room in hell
he kills another then exton strikes him down that hand shall burn in never quenching fire that staggers thus my person
exton thy fierce hand hath with the king’s blood stained the king’s own land
thy seat is up on high whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
as full of valour as of royal blood
o would the deed were good
for now the devil that told me i did well says that this deed is chronicled in hell
this dead king to the living king i’ll bear
take hence the rest and give them burial here
enter king henry and york with lords and attendants
kind uncle york the latest news we hear is that the rebels have consumed with fire our town of cicester in gloucestershire but whether they be ta’en or slain we hear not
first to thy sacred state wish i all happiness
the next news is i have to london sent the heads of salisbury spencer blunt and kent
the manner of their taking may appear at large discoursed in this paper here
we thank thee gentle percy for thy pains and to thy worth will add right worthy gains
my lord i have from oxford sent to london the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely two of the dangerous consorted traitors that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow
thy pains fitzwater shall not be forgot
right noble is thy merit well i wot
enter harry percy with the bishop of carlisle
the grand conspirator abbot of westminster with clog of conscience and sour melancholy hath yielded up his body to the grave
but here is carlisle living to abide thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride
carlisle this is your doom choose out some secret place some reverend room more than thou hast and with it joy thy life
so as thou liv’st in peace die free from strife for though mine enemy thou hast ever been high sparks of honour in thee have i seen
enter exton with attendants bearing a coffin
great king within this coffin i present thy buried fear
herein all breathless lies the mightiest of thy greatest enemies richard of bordeaux by me hither brought
exton i thank thee not for thou hast wrought a deed of slander with thy fatal hand upon my head and all this famous land
from your own mouth my lord did i this deed
they love not poison that do poison need nor do i thee
though i did wish him dead i hate the murderer love him murdered
the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour but neither my good word nor princely favour
with cain go wander thorough shades of night and never show thy head by day nor light
lords i protest my soul is full of woe that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
come mourn with me for what i do lament and put on sullen black incontinent
i’ll make a voyage to the holy land to wash this blood off from my guilty hand
march sadly after grace my mournings here in weeping after this untimely bier
a street enter richard duke of gloucester solus gloucester
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lour d upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums chang d to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures
grim visag d war hath smooth d his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady s chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well spoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days
plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mew d up about a prophecy which says that g of edward s heirs the murderer shall be
dive thoughts down to my soul
enter clarence guarded and brakenbury brother good day
what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace
his majesty tend ring my person s safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to th tower
alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers
o belike his majesty hath some intent that you should be new christ ned in the tower
but what s the matter clarence
yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the cross row plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he
these as i learn and such like toys as these hath mov d his highness to commit me now
why this it is when men are rul d by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity
was it not she and that good man of worship antony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is delivered
we are not safe clarence we are not safe
by heaven i think there is no man is secure but the queen s kindred and night walking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
heard you not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was for her delivery
humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty
i ll tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous o er worn widow and herself since that our brother dubb d them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in our monarchy
i beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with your brother
even so an t please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore s wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen s kindred are made gentlefolks
with this my lord myself have naught to do
naught to do with mistress shore
i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best to do it secretly alone
i do beseech your grace to pardon me and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke
we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
we are the queen s abjects and must obey
brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoe er you will employ me in were it to call king edward s widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine
i know it pleaseth neither of us well
well your imprisonment shall not be long i will deliver or else lie for you
exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard gloucester
go tread the path that thou shalt ne er return
simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands
good time of day unto my gracious lord
as much unto my good lord chamberlain
well are you welcome to the open air
how hath your lordship brook d imprisonment
with patience noble lord as prisoners must but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment
no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevail d as much on him as you
more pity that the eagles should be mew d whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty
no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily
now by saint john that news is bad indeed
o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consum d his royal person
tis very grievous to be thought upon
go you before and i will follow you
exit hastings he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be pack d with posthorse up to heaven
i ll in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steel d with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in
for then i ll marry warwick s youngest daughter
what though i kill d her husband and her father
the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto
but yet i run before my horse to market
clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains
another street enter corpse of king henry the sixth with halberds to guard it lady anne being the mourner attended by tressel and berkeley anne
set down set down your honourable load if honour may be shrouded in a hearse whilst i awhile obsequiously lament th untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
poor key cold figure of a holy king
pale ashes of the house of lancaster
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost to hear the lamentations of poor anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughtered son stabb d by the self same hand that made these wounds
lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
o cursed be the hand that made these holes
cursed the heart that had the heart to do it
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to adders spiders toads or any creeping venom d thing that lives
if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness
if ever he have wife let her be made more miserable by the death of him than i am made by my young lord and thee
come now towards chertsey with your holy load taken from paul s to be interred there and still as you are weary of this weight rest you whiles i lament king henry s corse
the bearers take up the coffin enter gloucester gloucester
stay you that bear the corse and set it down
what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds
villains set down the corse or by saint paul i ll make a corse of him that disobeys
my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul i ll strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
the bearers set down the coffin anne
alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
sweet saint for charity be not so curst
foul devil for god s sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell fill d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries
dead henry s wounds open their congeal d mouths and bleed afresh
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deeds inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural
o god which this blood mad st revenge his death
o earth which this blood drink st revenge his death
either heav n with lightning strike the murd rer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good king s blood which his hell govern d arm hath butchered
lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses
villain thou knowest nor law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
but i know none and therefore am no beast
o wonderful when devils tell the truth
more wonderful when angels are so angry
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposed crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself
vouchsafe diffus d infection of a man of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to accuse thy cursed self
fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself
fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself
by such despair i should accuse myself
and by despairing shalt thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself that didst unworthy slaughter upon others
say that i slew them not
then say they were not slain
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
i did not kill your husband
nay he is dead and slain by edward s hands
in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murd rous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point
i was provoked by her sland rous tongue that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind that never dream st on aught but butcheries
didst thou not kill this king
then god grant me to thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
o he was gentle mild and virtuous
the better for the king of heaven that hath him
he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth
and thou unfit for any place but hell
yes one place else if you will hear me name it
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
so will it madam till i lie with you
but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall something into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner
thou wast the cause and most accurs d effect
your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
these eyes could not endure that beauty s wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by
as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life
black night o ershade thy day and death thy life
curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
i would i were to be reveng d on thee
it is a quarrel most unnatural to be reveng d on him that loveth thee
it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be reveng d on him that kill d my husband
he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband
his better doth not breathe upon the earth
he lives that loves thee better than he could
the self same name but one of better nature
she spits at him why dost thou spit at me
would it were mortal poison for thy sake
never came poison from so sweet a place
never hung poison on a fouler toad
thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death
i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is propos d my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
she looks scornfully at him teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made for kissing lady not for such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee
he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me
nay now dispatch twas i that stabb d young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on
she falls the sword take up the sword again or take up me
arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be thy executioner
then bid me kill myself and i will do it anne
speak it again and even with the word this hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths shalt thou be accessary
i would i knew thy heart
tis figur d in my tongue
i fear me both are false
say then my peace is made
but shall i live in hope
all men i hope live so
to take is not to give
look how my ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine
and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
that it may please you leave these sad designs to him that hath most cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby house where after i have solemnly interr d at chertsey monast ry this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you
for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon
with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent
tressel and berkeley go along with me
tis more than you deserve but since you teach me how to flatter you imagine i have said farewell already
exeunt two gentlemen with lady anne gloucester
no to white friars there attend my coming
exeunt all but gloucester was ever woman in this humour woo d
was ever woman in this humour won
i ll have her but i will not keep her long
i that kill d her husband and his father to take her in her heart s extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of my hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i no friends to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing
hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabb d in my angry mood at tewksbury
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman fram d in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet abase her eyes on me that cropp d the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed
on me whose all not equals edward s moiety
on me that halts and am misshapen thus
my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while
upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marv llous proper man
i ll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body
since i am crept in favour with myself i will maintain it with some little cost
but first i ll turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love
shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass
the palace enter queen elizabeth lord rivers and lord grey rivers
have patience madam there s no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustom d health
in that you brook it ill it makes him worse therefore for god s sake entertain good comfort and cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes
if he were dead what would betide on me
no other harm but loss of such a lord
the loss of such a lord includes all harms
the heavens have bless d you with a goodly son to be your comforter when he is gone
ah he is young and his minority is put unto the trust of richard gloucester a man that loves not me nor none of you
is it concluded he shall be protector
it is determin d not concluded yet but so it must be if the king miscarry
here come the lords of buckingham and derby
good time of day unto your royal grace
god make your majesty joyful as you have been
the countess richmond good my lord of derby to your good prayer will scarcely say amen
yet derby notwithstanding she s your wife and loves not me be you good lord assur d i hate not you for her proud arrogance
i do beseech you either not believe the envious slanders of her false accusers or if she be accus d on true report bear with her weakness which i think proceeds from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
saw you the king to day my lord of derby
but now the duke of buckingham and i are come from visiting his majesty
what likelihood of his amendment lords
madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully
ay madam he desires to make atonement between the duke of gloucester and your brothers and between them and my lord chamberlain and sent to warn them to his royal presence
i fear our happiness is at the height
enter gloucester hastings and dorset gloucester
they do me wrong and i will not endure it
who is it that complains unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not
by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
because i cannot flatter and look fair smile in men s faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy
cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abus d with silken sly insinuating jacks
to who in all this presence speaks your grace
to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
when have i injur d thee
when done thee wrong or thee or thee or any of your faction
his royal grace whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet searce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
the king on his own royal disposition and not provok d by any suitor else aiming belike at your interior hatred that in your outward action shows itself against my children brothers and myself makes him to send that he may learn the ground
i cannot tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
since every jack became a gentleman there s many a gentle person made a jack
come come we know your meaning brother gloucester you envy my advancement and my friends god grant we never may have need of you
meantime god grants that i have need of you
our brother is imprison d by your means myself disgrac d and the nobility held in contempt while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
by him that rais d me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoy d i never did incense his majesty against the duke of clarence but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings late imprisonment
she may my lord for gloucester
she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honours on your high desert
she may ay marry may she rivers
marry with a king a bachelor and a handsome stripling too
iwis your grandam had a worser match
my lord of gloucester i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
by heaven i will acquaint his majesty of those gross taunts that oft i have endur d
i had rather be a country servant maid than a great queen with this condition to be so baited scorn d and stormed at
enter old queen margaret behind small joy have i in being england s queen
and less ned be that small god i beseech him
thy honour state and seat is due to me
threat you me with telling of the king
look what i have said i will avouch t in presence of the king
i dare adventure to be sent to th tow r
tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
i do remember them to well thou kill dst my husband henry in the tower and edward my poor son at tewksbury
ere you were queen ay or your husband king i was a pack horse in his great affairs a weeder out of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spent mine own
ay and much better blood than his or thine
in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster and rivers so were you
was not your husband in margaret s battle at saint albans slain
let me put in your minds if you forget what you have been ere this and what you are withal what i have been and what i am
a murd rous villain and so still thou art
poor clarence did forsake his father warwick ay and forswore himself which jesu pardon queen margaret
to fight on edward s party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mewed up
i would to god my heart were flint like edward s or edward s soft and pitiful like mine
i am too childish foolish for this world
hie thee to hell for shame and leave this world thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
my lord of gloucester in those busy days which here you urge to prove us enemies we follow d then our lord our sovereign king
so should we you if you should be our king
i had rather be a pedlar
far be it from my heart the thought thereof
as little joy my lord as you suppose you should enjoy were you this country s king as little joy you may suppose in me that i enjoy being the queen thereof
as little joy enjoys the queen thereof for i am she and altogether joyless
i can no longer hold me patient
advancing hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out in sharing that which you have pill d from me
which of you trembles not that looks on me
if not that i am queen you bow like subjects yet that by you depos d you quake like rebels
ah gentle villain do not turn away
foul wrinkled witch what mak st thou in my sight
but repetition of what thou hast marr d that will i make before i let thee go
wert thou not banished on pain of death
i was but i do find more pain in banishment than death can yield me here by my abode
a husband and a son thou ow st to me and thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
this sorrow that i have by right is yours and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns drew st rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gav st the duke a clout steep d in the faultless blood of pretty rutland his curses then from bitterness of soul denounc d against thee are all fall n upon thee and god not we hath plagu d thy bloody deed
so just is god to right the innocent
o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe and the most merciless that e er was heard of
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
no man but prophesied revenge for it
northumberland then present wept to see it
what were you snarling all before i came ready to catch each other by the throat and turn you all your hatred now on me
did york s dread curse prevail so much with heaven that henry s death my lovely edward s death their kingdom s loss my woeful banishment should all but answer for that peevish brat
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
though not by war by surfeit die your king as ours by murder to make him a king
edward thy son that now is prince of wales for edward our son that was prince of wales die in his youth by like untimely violence
thyself a queen for me that was a queen outlive thy glory like my wretched self
long mayest thou live to wail thy children s death and see another as i see thee now deck d in thy rights as thou art stall d in mine
long die thy happy days before thy death and after many length ned hours of grief die neither mother wife nor england s queen
rivers and dorset you were standers by and so wast thou lord hastings when my son was stabb d with bloody daggers
god i pray him that none of you may live his natural age but by some unlook d accident cut off
have done thy charm thou hateful wither d hag
stay dog for thou shalt hear me
if heaven have any grievous plague in store exceeding those that i can wish upon thee o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe and then hurl down their indignation on thee the troubler of the poor world s peace
the worm of conscience still be gnaw thy soul
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv st and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine unless it be while some tormenting dream affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
thou elvish mark d abortive rooting hog thou that wast seal d in thy nativity the slave of nature and the son of hell thou slander of thy heavy mother s womb thou loathed issue of thy father s loins thou rag of honour thou detested gloucester
i cry thee mercy then for i did think that thou hadst call d me all these bitter names
why so i did but look d for no reply
o let me make the period to my curse
tis done by me and ends in margaret
thus have you breath d your curse against yourself
poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
why strew st thou sugar on that bottled spider whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
thou whet st a knife to kill thyself
the day will come that thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse this poisonous bunch back d toad
false boding woman end thy frantic curse lest to thy harm thou move our patience
you have all mov d mine
were you well serv d you would be taught your duty
to serve me well you all should do me duty teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dispute not with her she is lunatic
peace master marquis you are malapert your fire new stamp of honour is scarce current
o that your young nobility could judge what twere to lose it and be miserable
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
good counsel marry learn it learn it marquis
it touches you my lord as much as me
ay and much more but i was born so high our aery buildeth in the cedar s top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
and turns the sun to shade alas
witness my son now in the shade of death whose bright out shining beams thy cloudy wrath hath in eternal darkness folded up
your aery buildeth in our aery s nest
o god that seest it do not suffer it as it is won with blood lost be it so
peace peace for shame if not for charity
urge neither charity nor shame to me
uncharitably with me have you dealt and shamefully my hopes by you are butcher d
my charity is outrage life my shame and in that shame still live my sorrow s rage
o princely buckingham i ll kiss thy hand in sign of league and amity with thee
now fair befall thee and thy noble house
thy garments are not spotted with our blood nor thou within the compass of my curse
nor no one here for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air
i will not think but they ascend the sky and there awake god s gentle sleeping peace
o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
look when he fawns he bites and when he bites his venom tooth will rankle to the death have not to do with him beware of him sin death and hell have set their marks on him and all their ministers attend on him
what doth she say my lord of buckingham
nothing that i respect my gracious lord
what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
o but remember this another day when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow and say poor margaret was a prophetess
live each of you the subjects to his hate and he to yours and all of you to god s
my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses
i muse why she s at liberty
i cannot blame her by god s holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her
i never did her any to my knowledge
yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now
marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is frank d up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause thereof
a virtuous and a christian like conclusion to pray for them that have done scathe to us
so do i ever aside being well advis d for had i curs d now i had curs d myself
madam his majesty doth can for you and for your grace and you my gracious lords
lords will you go with me
i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others
clarence who i indeed have cast in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to derby hastings buckingham and tell them tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother
now they believe it and withal whet me to be reveng d on rivers dorset grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil
and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stol n forth of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil
enter two murderers but soft here come my executioners
how now my hardy stout resolved mates
are you now going to dispatch this thing
we are my lord and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is
well thought upon i have it here about me
gives the warrant when you have done repair to crosby place
but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is well spoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate talkers are no good doers
be assur d we go to use our hands and not our tongues
your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes fall tears
i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch
the tower enter clarence and keeper keeper
why looks your grace so heavily to day
o i have pass d a miserable night so full of fearful dreams of ugly sights that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time
what was your dream my lord
methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embark d to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches
thence we look d toward england and cited up a thousand heavy times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall n us
as we pac d along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main
o lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in my ears what sights of ugly death within my eyes
methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks a thousand men that fishes gnaw d upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatt red in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead men s skulls and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems that woo d the slimy bottom of the deep and mock d the dead bones that lay scatt red by
had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon these secrets of the deep
methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood stopp d in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty vast and wand ring air but smother d it within my panting bulk who almost burst to belch it in the sea
awak d you not in this sore agony
no no my dream was lengthen d after life
o then began the tempest to my soul
i pass d methought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night
the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great father in law renowned warwick who spake aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence
then came wand ring by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he shriek d out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjur d clarence that stabb d me in the field by tewksbury
seize on him furies take him unto torment
with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environ d me and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling wak d and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made my dream
no marvel lord though it affrighted you i am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
ah keeper keeper i have done these things that now give evidence against my soul for edward s sake and see how he requites me
if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be aveng d on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
keeper i prithee sit by me awhile my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
god give your grace good rest
clarence sleeps enter brakenbury the lieutenant brakenbury
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night
princes have but their titles for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imaginations they often feel a world of restless cares so that between their tides and low name there s nothing differs but the outward fame
enter the two murderers first murderer
what wouldst thou fellow and how cam st thou hither
i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
tis better sir than to be tedious
let him see our commission and talk no more
i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands
i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless from the meaning
there lies the duke asleep and there the keys
i ll to the king and signify to him that thus i have resign d to you my charge
you may sir tis a point of wisdom
exeunt brakenbury and keeper second murderer
what shall i stab him as he sleeps
no he ll say twas done cowardly when he wakes
why he shall never wake until the great judgment day
why then he ll say we stabb d him sleeping
the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me
not to kill him having a warrant but to be damn d for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me
i thought thou hadst been resolute
so i am to let him live
i ll back to the duke of gloucester and tell him so
nay i prithee stay a little
i hope this passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty
how dost thou feel thyself now
faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me
remember our reward when the deed s done
zounds he dies i had forgot the reward
o in the duke of gloucester s purse
when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out
tis no matter let it go there s few or none will entertain it
what if it come to thee again
i ll not meddle with it it makes a man coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbour s wife but it detects him
tis a blushing shame fac d spirit that mutinies in a man s bosom it fills a man full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance i found
it beggars any man that keeps it
it is turn d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it
zounds tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke
take the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make the sigh
i am strong fram d he cannot prevail with me
spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation
come shall we fall to work
take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then chop him in the malmsey butt in the next room
and make a sop of him
no we ll reason with him
give me a cup of wine
you shall have wine enough my lord anon
in god s name what art thou
but not as i am royal
nor you as we are loyal
thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
my voice is now the king s my looks mine own
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
wherein my friends have i offended you
offended us you have not but the king
i shall be reconcil d to him again
never my lord therefore prepare to die
are you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent
where is the evidence that doth accuse me
what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounc d the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful
i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christ s dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable
what we will do we do upon command
and he that hath commanded is our king
the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder
will you then spurn at his edict and fulfil a man s
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand to hurl upon their heads that break his law
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
and like a traitor to the name of god didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade unripp dst the bowels of thy sov reign s son
whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend
how canst thou urge god s dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in such dear degree
for whose sake did i that ill deed
for edward for my brother for his sake
he sends you not to murder me for this for in that sin he is as deep as i
if god will be avenged for the deed o know you yet he doth it publicly
take not the quarrel from his pow rful arm he needs no indirect or lawless course to cut off those that have offended him
who made thee then a bloody minister when gallant springing brave plantagenet that princely novice was struck dead by thee
my brother s love the devil and my rage
thy brother s love our duty and thy faults provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
if you do love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well
if you are hir d for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death
you are deceiv d your brother gloucester hates you
o no he loves me and he holds me dear
go you to him from me
tell him when that our princely father york bless d his three sons with his victorious arm and charg d us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship
bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
ay millstones as he lesson d us to weep
o do not slander him for he is kind
come you deceive yourself tis he that sends us to destroy you here
it cannot be for he bewept my fortune and hugg d me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery
why so he doth when he delivers you from this earth s thraldom to the joys of heaven
make peace with god for you must die my lord
have you that holy feeling in your souls to counsel me to make my peace with god and are you yet to your own souls so blind that you will war with god by murd ring me
o sirs consider they that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed
not to relent is beastly savage devilish
which of you if you were a prince s son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life
my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not
stabbing him take that and that
if all this will not do i ll drown you in the malmsey butt within
exit with the body second murderer
a bloody deed and desperately dispatch d
how fain like pilate would i wash my hands of this most grievous murder
re enter first murderer first murderer how now what mean st thou that thou help st me not
by heavens the duke shall know how slack you have been
i would he knew that i had sav d his brother
take thou the fee and tell him what i say for i repent me that the duke is slain
well i ll go hide the body in some hole till that the duke give order for his burial and when i have my meed i will away for this will out and then i must not stay
enter king edward sick queen elizabeth dorset rivers hastings buckingham grey and others king edward
now have i done a good day s work
you peers continue this united league
i every day expect an embassage from my redeemer to redeem me hence and more at peace my soul shall part to heaven since i have made my friends at peace on earth
hastings and rivers take each other s hand dissemble not your hatred swear your love
by heaven my soul is purg d from grudging hate and with my hand i seal my true heart s love
so thrive i as i truly swear the like
take heed you dally not before your king lest he that is the supreme king of kings confound your hidden falsehood and award either of you to be the other s end
so prosper i as i swear perfect love
and i as i love hastings with my heart
madam yourself is not exempt from this nor you son dorset buckingham nor you you have been factious one against the other
wife love lord hastings let him kiss your hand and what you do do it unfeignedly
there hastings i will never more remember our former hatred so thrive i and mine
dorset embrace him hastings love lord marquis
this interchange of love i here protest upon my part shall be inviolable
now princely buckingham seal thou this league with thy embracements to my wife s allies and make me happy in your unity
to the queen whenever buckingham doth turn his hate upon your grace but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love
when i have most need to employ a friend and most assured that he is a friend deep hollow treacherous and full of guile be he unto me
this do i beg of god when i am cold in love to you or yours
a pleasing cordial princely buckingham is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here to make the blessed period of this peace
and in good time here comes sir richard ratcliff and the duke
good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day
happy indeed as we have spent the day
gloucester we have done deeds of charity made peace of enmity fair love of hate between these swelling wrong incensed peers
a blessed labour my most sovereign lord
among this princely heap if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise hold me a foe if i unwittingly or in my rage have aught committed that is hardly borne to any in this presence i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace tis death to me to be at enmity i hate it and desire all good men s love
first madam i entreat true peace of you which i will purchase with my duteous service of you my noble cousin buckingham if ever any grudge were lodg d between us of you and you lord rivers and of dorset that all without desert have frown d on me of you lord woodville and lord scales of you dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born to night
i thank my god for my humility
a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
i would to god all strifes were well compounded
my sovereign lord i do beseech your highness to take our brother clarence to your grace
why madam have i off red love for this to be so flouted in this royal presence
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead
they all start you do him injury to scorn his corse
who knows not he is dead
all seeing heaven what a world is this
look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
ay my good lord and no man in the presence but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
but he poor man by your first order died and that a winged mercury did bear some tardy cripple bare the countermand that came too lag to see him buried
god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion
a boon my sovereign for my service done
i prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow
i will not rise unless your highness hear me
then say at once what is it thou requests
the forfeit sovereign of my servant s life who slew to day a riotous gentleman lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
have i a tongue to doom my brother s death and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
my brother killed no man his fault was thought and yet his punishment was bitter death
who sued to me for him
who in my wrath kneel d at my feet and bid me be advis d
who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick and did fight for me
who told me in the field at tewksbury when oxford had me down he rescued me and said dear brother live and be a king
who told me when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death how he did lap me even in his garments and did give himself all thin and naked to the numb cold night
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluck d and not a man of you had so much race to put it in my mind
but when your carters or your waiting vassals have done a drunken slaughter and defac d the precious image of our dear redeemer you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon and i unjustly too must grant it you
derby rises but for my brother not a man would speak nor i ungracious speak unto myself for him poor soul
the proudest of you all have been beholding to him in his life yet none of you would once beg for his life
o god i fear thy justice will take hold on me and you and mine and yours for this
come hastings help me to my closet
exeunt some with king and queen gloucester
this is the fruits of rashness
mark d you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen look d pale when they did hear of clarence death
o they did urge it still unto the king
come lords will you go to comfort edward with our company
the palace enter the old duchess of york with the son and daughter of clarence son
good grandam tell us is our father dead
why do you weep so oft and beat your breast and cry o clarence my unhappy son
why do you look on us and shake your head and call us orphans wretches castaways if that our noble father were alive
my pretty cousins you mistake me both i do lament the sickness of the king as loath to lose him not your father s death it were lost sorrow to wail one that s lost
then you conclude my grandam he is dead
the king mine uncle is to blame for it
god will revenge it whom i will importune with earnest prayers all to that effect
the king doth love you well
incapable and shallow innocents you cannot guess who caus d your father s death
grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester told me the king provok d to it by the queen devis d impeachments to imprison him
and when my uncle told me so he wept and pitied me and kindly kiss d my cheek bade me rely on him as on my father and he would love me dearly as a child
ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape and with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice
he is my son ay and therein my shame yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
enter queen elizabeth with her hair about her ears rivers and dorset after her queen elizabeth
ah who shall hinder me to wail and weep to chide my fortune and torment myself
i ll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy
what means this scene of rude impatience
to make an act of tragic violence
edward my lord thy son our king is dead
why grow the branches when the root is gone
why wither not the leaves that want their sap
if you will live lament if die be brief that our swift winged souls may catch the king s or like obedient subjects follow him to his new kingdom of ne er changing night
ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow as i had title in thy noble husband
i have bewept a worthy husband s death and liv d with looking on his images but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crack d in pieces by malignant death and i for comfort have but one false glass that grieves me when i see my shame in him
thou art a widow yet thou art a mother and hast the comfort of thy children left but death hath snatch d my husband from mine arms and pluck d two crutches from my feeble hands clarence and edward
o what cause have i thine being but a moiety of my moan to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
ah aunt you wept not for our father s death
how can we aid you with our kindred tears
our fatherless distress was left unmoan d your widow dolour likewise be unwept
give me no help in lamentation i am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes that i being govern d by the watery moon may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
ah for my husband for my dear lord edward
ah for our father for our dear lord clarence
alas for both both mine edward and clarence
what stay had i but edward
what stay had we but clarence
what stays had i but they
was never widow had so dear a loss
were never orphans had so dear a loss
was never mother had so dear a loss
alas i am the mother of these griefs
their woes are parcell d mine is general
she for an edward weeps and so do i i for a clarence weep so doth not she
these babes for clarence weep and so do i i for an edward weep so do not they
alas you three on me threefold distress d pour all your tears
i am your sorrow s nurse and i will pamper it with lamentation
god is much displeas d that you take with unthankfulness his doing
in common worldly things tis called ungrateful with dull unwillingness to repay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent much more to be thus opposite with heaven for it requires the royal debt it lent you
madam bethink you like a careful mother of the young prince your son
send straight for him let him be crown d in him your comfort lives
drown desperate sorrow in dead edward s grave and plant your joys in living edward s throne
enter gloucester buckingham derby hastings and ratcliff gloucester
all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can help our harms by wailing them
madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did not see your grace
humbly on my knee i crave your blessing
god bless thee and put meekness in thy breast love charity obedience and true duty
aside and make me die a good old man
that is the butt end of a mother s blessing i marvel that her grace did leave it out
you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan now cheer each other in each other s love
though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son
the broken rancour of your high swol n hearts but lately splinter d knit and join d together must gently be preserv d cherish d and kept
me seemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london to be crown d our king
why with some little train my lord of buckingham
marry my lord lest by a multitude the new heal d wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern d where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented
i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me
and so in me and so i think in an
yet since it is but green it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach which haply by much company might be urg d therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
madam and you my sister will you go to give your censures in this business
exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester buckingham
my lord whoever journeys to the prince for god sake let not us two stay at home for by the way i ll sort occasion as index to the story we late talk d of to part the queen s proud kindred from the prince
my other self my counsel s consistory my oracle my prophet my dear cousin i as a child will go by thy direction
toward ludlow then for we ll not stay behind
a street enter one citizen at one door and another at the other first citizen
i promise you i scarcely know myself
yes that the king is dead
ill news by r lady seldom comes the better
i fear i fear twill prove a giddy world
doth the news hold of good king edward s death
ay sir it is too true god help the while
then masters look to see a troublous world
no no by god s good grace his son shall reign
woe to that land that s govern d by a child
in him there is a hope of government which in his nonage council under him and in his full and ripened years himself no doubt shall then and till then govern well
so stood the state when henry the sixth was crown d in paris but at nine months old
no no good friends god wot for then this land was famously enrich d with politic grave counsel then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
why so hath this both by his father and mother
better it were they all came by his father or by his father there were none at all for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not
o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
and the queen s sons and brothers haught and proud and were they to be rul d and not to rule this sickly land might solace as before
come come we fear the worst all will be well
when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall then winter is at hand when the sun sets who doth not look for night
untimely storms make men expect a dearth
all may be well but if god sort it so tis more than we deserve or i expect
truly the hearts of men are fun of fear
you cannot reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and fun of dread
before the days of change still is it so by a divine instinct men s minds mistrust ensuing danger as by proof we see the water swell before a boist rous storm
but leave it all to god
marry we were sent for to the justices
and so was i i ll bear you company
the palace enter the archbishop of york the young duke of york queen elizabeth and the duchess of york archbishop
last night i hear they lay at stony stratford and at northampton they do rest to night to morrow or next day they will be here
i long with all my heart to see the prince
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him
but i hear no they say my son of york has almost overta en him in his growth
ay mother but i would not have it so
why my good cousin it is good to grow
grandam one night as we did sit at supper my uncle rivers talk d how i did grow more than my brother
ay quoth my uncle gloucester small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace
and since methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flow rs are slow and weeds make haste
good faith good faith the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee
he was the wretched st thing when he was young so long a growing and so leisurely that if his rule were true he should be gracious
and so no doubt he is my gracious madam
i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
now by my troth if i had been rememb red i could have given my uncle s grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touch d mine
i prithee let me hear it
marry they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
grandam this would have been a biting jest
i prithee pretty york who told thee this
why she was dead ere thou wast born
if twere not she i cannot tell who told me
go to you are too shrewd
good madam be not angry with the child
such news my lord as grieves me to report
lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret and with them sir thomas vaughan prisoners
the mighty dukes gloucester and buckingham
the sum of all i can i have disclos d
why or for what the nobles were committed is all unknown to me my gracious lord
ay me i see the ruin of my house
the tiger now hath seiz d the gentle hind insulting tyranny begins to jet upon the innocent and aweless throne
i see as in a map the end of all
accursed and unquiet wrangling days how many of you have mine eyes beheld
my husband lost his life to get the crown and often up and down my sons were toss d for me to joy and weep their gain and loss and being seated and domestic broils clean over blown themselves the conquerors make war upon themselves brother to brother blood to blood self against self
o preposterous and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen or let me die to look on death no more
come come my boy we will to sanctuary
stay i will go with you
to the queen my gracious lady go
and thither bear your treasure and your goods
for my part i ll resign unto your grace the seal i keep and so betide to me as well i tender you and all of yours
go i ll conduct you to the sanctuary
enter the prince of wales gloucester buckingham catesby cardinal bourchier and others buckingham
welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber
welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
the weary way hath made you melancholy
no uncle but our crosses on the way have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
i want more uncles here to welcome me
sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet div d into the world s deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sug red words but look d not on the poison of their hearts
god keep you from them and from such false friends
god keep me from false friends
my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you
enter the lord mayor and his train mayor
god bless your grace with health and happy days
i thank you good my lord and thank you all
i thought my mother and my brother york would long ere this have met us on the way
fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no
and in good time here comes the sweating lord
on what occasion god he knows not i the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary
the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace but by his mother was perforce withheld
fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers
lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently
if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york anon expect him here but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary
not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin
you are too senseless obstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional
weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him
the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserv d the place and those who have the wit to claim the place
this prince hath neither claim d it nor deserv d it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there
oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children never till now
my lord you shall o errule my mind for once
come on lord hastings will you go with me
good lords make all the speedy haste you may
exeunt cardinal and hastings say uncle gloucester if our brother come where shall we sojourn till our coronation
where it seems best unto your royal self
if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation
i do not like the tower of any place
did julius caesar build that place my lord
he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have re edified
is it upon record or else reported successively from age to age he built it
but say my lord it were not regist red methinks the truth should eve from age to age as twere retail d to all posterity even to the general all ending day
aside so wise so young they say do never live long
i say without characters fame lives long
aside thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word
that julius caesar was a famous man with what his valour did enrich his wit his wit set down to make his valour live
death makes no conquest of this conqueror for now he lives in fame though not in life
i ll tell you what my cousin buckingham buckingham
an if i live until i be a man i ll win our ancient right in france again or die a soldier as i liv d a king
aside short summers lightly have a forward spring
enter hastings young york and the cardinal buckingham
now in good time here comes the duke of york
richard of york how fares our loving brother
well my dread lord so must i can you now
ay brother to our grief as it is yours
too late he died that might have kept that title which by his death hath lost much majesty
how fares our cousin noble lord of york
o my lord you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
o my fair cousin i must not say so
then he is more beholding to you than i gloucester
he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman
i pray you uncle give me this dagger
of my kind uncle that i know will give and being but a toy which is no grief to give
a greater gift than that i ll give my cousin
o that s the sword to it
ay gentle cousin were it light enough
o then i see you will part but with light gifts in weightier things you ll say a beggar nay
it is too heavy for your grace to wear
i weigh it lightly were it heavier
what would you have my weapon little lord
i would that i might thank you as you call me
my lord of york will still be cross in talk
uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
you mean to bear me not to bear with me
uncle my brother mocks both you and me because that i am little like an ape he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
with what a sharp provided wit he reasons
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself
so cunning and so young is wonderful
my lord will t please you pass along
myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you
what will you go unto the tower my lord
my lord protector needs will have it so
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
marry my uncle clarence angry ghost
my grandam told me he was murder d there
nor none that live i hope
an if they live i hope i need not fear
but come my lord and with a heavy heart thinking on them go i unto the tower
exeunt all but gloucester buckingham and catesby buckingham
think you my lord this little prating york was not incensed by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
o tis a perilous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable
he is all the mother s from the top to toe
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart
thou know st our reasons urg d upon the way
is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle
he for his father s sake so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him
what think st thou then of stanley
he will do all in all as hastings doth
well then no more but this go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him to morrow to the tower to sit about the coronation
if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and tell him all our reasons if he be leaden icy cold unwilling be thou so too and so break off the talk and give us notice of his inclination for we to morrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employ d
tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries to morrow are let blood at pomfret castle and bid my lord for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
good catesby go effect this business soundly
my good lords both with all the heed i can
shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep
at crosby house there shall you find us both
now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots
chop off his head something we will determine
and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and all the movables whereof the king my brother was possess d
i ll claim that promise at your grace s hand
and look to have it yielded with all kindness
come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form
before lord hasting s house enter a messenger to the door of hastings messenger
within what is t o clock
cannot my lord stanley sleep these tedious nights
so it appears by that i have to say
first he commends him to your noble self
then certifies your lordship that this night he dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
besides he says there are two councils kept and that may be determin d at the one which may make you and him to rue at th other
therefore he sends to know your lordship s pleasure if you will presently take horse with him and with all speed post with him toward the north to shun the danger that his soul divines
go fellow go return unto thy lord bid him not fear the separated council his honour and myself are at the one and at the other is my good friend catesby where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence
tell him his fears are shallow without instance and for his dreams i wonder he s so simple to trust the mock ry of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
go bid thy master rise and come to me and we will both together to the tower where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
i ll go my lord and tell him what you say
many good morrows to my noble lord
good morrow catesby you are early stirring
what news what news in this our tott ring state
it is a reeling world indeed my lord and i believe will never stand upright till richard wear the garland of the realm
i ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before i ll see the crown so foul misplac d
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
ay on my life and hopes to find you forward upon his party for the gain thereof and thereupon he sends you this good news that this same very day your enemies the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
indeed i am no mourner for that news because they have been still my adversaries but that i ll give my voice on richard s side to bar my master s heirs in true descent god knows i will not do it to the death
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence that they which brought me in my master s hate i live to look upon their tragedy
well catesby ere a fortnight make me older i ll send some packing that yet think not on t
tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord when men are unprepar d and look not for it
and so falls it out with rivers vaughan grey and so twill do with some men else that think themselves as safe as thou and i who as thou knowest are dear to princely richard and to buckingham
the princes both make high account of you aside for they account his head upon the bridge
i know they do and i have well deserv d it
enter lord stanley come on come on where is your boar spear man
fear you the boar and go so unprovided
my lord good morrow good morrow catesby
you may jest on but by the holy rood i do not like these several councils i hastings
my lord i hold my life as dear as yours and never in my days i do protest was it so precious to me as tis now
think you but that i know our state secure i would be so triumphant as i am
the lords at pomfret when they rode from london were jocund and suppos d their states were sure and they indeed had no cause to mistrust but yet you see how soon the day o ercast
this sudden stab of rancour i misdoubt pray god i say i prove a needless coward
what shall we toward the tower
to day the lords you talk d of are beheaded
they for their truth might better wear their heads than some that have accus d them wear their hats
but come my lord let s away
go on before i ll talk with this good fellow
exeunt stanley and catesby how now hastings
how goes the world with thee
the better that your lordship please to ask
i tell thee man tis better with me now than when thou met st me last where now we meet then was i going prisoner to the tower by the suggestion of the queen s allies but now i tell thee keep it to thyself this day those enernies are put to death and i in better state than e er i was
god hold it to your honour s good content
gramercy hastings there drink that for me
well met my lord i am glad to see your honour
i thank thee good sir john with all my heart
i am in your debt for your last exercise come the next sabbath and i will content you
he whispers in his ear priest
i ll wait upon your lordship
what talking with a priest lord chamberlain
your friends at pomfret they do need the priest your honour hath no shriving work in hand
good faith and when i met this holy man the men you talk of came into my mind
what go you toward the tower
i do my lord but long i cannot stay there i shall return before your lordship thence
nay like enough for i stay dinner there
aside and supper too although thou knowest it not come will you go
i ll wait upon your lordship
pomfret castle enter sir richard ratcliff with halberds carrying the nobles rivers grey and vaughan to death rivers
sir richard ratcliff let me tell thee this to day shalt thou behold a subject die for truth for duty and for loyalty
god bless the prince from all the pack of you
a knot you are of damned blood suckers
you live that shall cry woe for this hereafter
dispatch the limit of your lives is out
o thou bloody prison fatal and ominous to noble peers
within the guilty closure of thy walls richard the second here was hack d to death and for more slander to thy dismal seat we give to thee our guiltless blood to drink
now margaret s curse is fall n upon our heads when she exclaim d on hastings you and i for standing by when richard stabb d her son
then curs d she richard then curs d she buckingham then curs d she hastings
o remember god to hear her prayer for them as now for us
and for my sister and her princely sons be satisfied dear god with our true blood which as thou know st unjustly must be spilt
make haste the hour of death is expiate
come grey come vaughan let us here embrace
farewell until we meet again in heaven
the tower enter buckingham derby hastings the bishop of ely ratcliff lovel with others and seat themselves at a table hastings
now noble peers the cause why we are met is to determine of the coronation
in god s name speak when is the royal day
is all things ready for the royal time
it is and wants but nomination
to morrow then i judge a happy day
who knows the lord protector s mind herein
who is most inward with the noble duke
your grace we think should soonest know his mind
we know each other s faces for our hearts he knows no more of mine than i of yours or i of his my lord than you of mine
lord hastings you and he are near in love
i thank his grace i know he loves me well but for his purpose in the coronation i have not sounded him nor he deliver d his gracious pleasure any way therein
but you my honourable lords may name the time and in the duke s behalf i ll give my voice which i presume he ll take in gentle part
in happy time here comes the duke himself
my noble lords and cousins an good morrow
i have been long a sleeper but i trust my absence doth neglect no great design which by my presence might have been concluded
had you not come upon your cue my lord william lord hastings had pronounc d your part i mean your voice for crowning of the king
than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well
my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there
i do beseech you send for some of them
marry and will my lord with all my heart
cousin of buckingham a word with you
takes him aside catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot that he will lose his head ere give consent his master s child as worshipfully he terms it shall lose the royalty of england s throne
withdraw yourself awhile i ll go with you
we have not yet set down this day of triumph
to morrow in my judgment is too sudden for i myself am not so well provided as else i would be were the day prolong d
re enter the bishop of ely bishop of ely
where is my lord the duke of gloucester
i have sent for these strawberries
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning there s some conceit or other likes him well when that he bids good morrow with such spirit
i think there s never a man in christendom can lesser hide his love or hate than he for by his face straight shall you know his heart
what of his heart perceive you in his face by any livelihood he show d to day
marry that with no man here he is offended for were he he had shown it in his looks
re enter gloucester and buckingham gloucester
i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damned witchcraft and that have prevail d upon my body with their hellish charms
the tender love i bear your grace my lord makes me most forward in this princely presence to doom th offenders whosoe er they be
i say my lord they have deserved death
then be your eyes the witness of their evil
look how i am bewitch d behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling wither d up
and this is edward s wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me
if they have done this deed my noble lord gloucester
if thou protector of this damned strumpet talk st thou to me of ifs
now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same
lovel and ratcliff look that it be done
the rest that love me rise and follow me
exeunt all but hastings lovel and ratcliff hastings
not a whit for me for i too fond might have prevented this
stanley did dream the boar did raze our helms and i did scorn it and disdain to fly
three times to day my foot cloth horse did stumble and started when he look d upon the tower as loath to bear me to the slaughter house
o now i need the priest that spake to me
i now repent i told the pursuivant as too triumphing how mine enemies to day at pomfret bloodily were butcher d and i myself secure in grace and favour
o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings wretched head
come come dispatch the duke would be at dinner
make a short shrift he longs to see your head
o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god
who builds his hope in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep
come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
i prophesy the fearfull st time to thee that ever wretched age hath look d upon
come lead me to the block bear him my head
they smile at me who shortly shall be dead
the tower walls enter gloucester and buckingham in rotten armour marvellous ill favoured gloucester
come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in middle of a word and then again begin and stop again as if thou were distraught and mad with terror
tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion
ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems
he is and see he brings the mayor along
enter the lord mayor and catesby buckingham
lord mayor the reason we have sent gloucester
look back defend thee here are enemies
god and our innocence defend and guard us
enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head gloucester
be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel
here is the head of that ignoble traitor the dangerous and unsuspected hastings
so dear i lov d the man that i must weep
i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breath d upon the earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts
so smooth he daub d his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shore s wife he liv d from all attainder of suspects
well well he was the covert st shelt red traitor that ever liv d
would you imagine or almost believe were t not that by great preservation we live to tell it that the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the council house to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
think you we are turks or infidels
or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly in the villain s death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforc d us to this execution
he deserv d his death and your good graces both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts
i never look d for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore
yet had we not determin d he should die until your lordship came to see his end which now the loving haste of these our friends something against our meanings have prevented because my lord i would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treasons that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconster us in him and wail his death
but my good lord your grace s words shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak and do not doubt right noble princes both but i ll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause
and to that end we wish d your lordship here t avoid the the the censures of the carping world
which since you come too late of our intent yet witness what you hear we did intend
and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
the mayor towards guildhall hies him in an post
there at your meet st advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward s children
tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so
moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretch d unto their servants daughters wives even where his raging eye or savage heart without control lusted to make a prey
nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by true computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father
yet touch this sparingly as twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives
doubt not my lord i ll play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu
if you thrive well bring them to baynard s castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learned bishops
i go and towards three or four o clock look for the news that the guildhall affords
go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
to catesby go thou to friar penker
bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard s castle
exeunt all but gloucester now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give order that no manner person have any time recourse unto the princes
a street enter a scrivener scrivener
here is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engross d that it may be to day read o er in paul s
and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i have spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it sent me the precedent was full as long a doing and yet within these five hours hastings liv d untainted unexamin d free at liberty
here s a good world the while
who is so gros that cannot see this palpable device
yet who s so bold but says he sees it not
bad is the world and all will come to nought when such ill dealing must be seen in thought
baynard s castle enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors gloucester
now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum say not a word
touch d you the bastardy of edward s children
i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france th insatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france and his resemblance being not like the duke
withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your discipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose untouch d or slightly handled in discourse
and when mine oratory drew toward end i bid them that did love their country s good cry god save richard england s royal king
no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones star d each on other and look d deadly pale
which when i saw i reprehended them and ask d the mayor what meant this wilfull silence
his answer was the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder
then he was urg d to tell my tale again
thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferr d but nothing spoke in warrant from himself
when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurl d up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard
and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard
and even here brake off and came away
will not the mayor then and his brethren come
the mayor is here at hand
intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen good my lord for on that ground i ll make a holy descant and be not easily won to our requests
play the maid s part still answer nay and take it
i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue
go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
exit gloucester enter the lord mayor aldermen and citizens welcome my lord
i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal
enter catesby now catesby what says your lord to my request
he doth entreat your grace my noble lord to visit him to morrow or next day
he is within with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and in no worldly suits would he be mov d to draw him from his holy exercise
return good catesby to the gracious duke tell him myself the mayor and aldermen in deep designs in matter of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace
i ll signify so much unto him straight
ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
he is not lolling on a lewd love bed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul
happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grace the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall not win him to it
marry god defend his grace should say us nay
re enter catesby now catesby what says his grace
my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to come to him
his grace not being warn d thereof before he fears my lord you mean no good to him
sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him
by heaven we come to him in perfect love and so once more return and tell his grace
exit catesby when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis much to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation
enter gloucester aloft between two bishops
see where his grace stands tween two clergymen
two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man
famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ear to our requests and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal
my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferr d the visitation of my friends
but leaving this what is your grace s pleasure
even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovern d isle
i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the city s eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
would it might please your grace on our entreaties to amend your fault
else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for another s gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own
for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just cause come i to move your grace
i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition
if not to answer you might haply think tongue tied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so season d with your faithful love to me then on the other side i check d my friends
therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request
first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smother d
but god be thank d there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellow d by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign
on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him
my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered
you say that edward is your brother s son
so say we too but not by edward s wife for first was he contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to his vow and afterward by substitute betroth d to bona sister to the king of france
these both put off a poor petitioner a care craz d mother to a many sons a beauty waning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his wanton eye seduc d the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loath d bigamy
by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners call the prince
more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue
then good my lord take to your royal self this proffer d benefit of dignity if not to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal true derived course
do good my lord your citizens entreat you
refuse not mighty lord this proffer d love
o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
alas why would you heap this care on me
i am unfit for state and majesty
i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you
if you refuse it as in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brother s son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kindred and egally indeed to all estates yet know whe er you accept our suit or no your brother s son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you
zounds i ll entreat no more
o do not swear my lord of buckingham
exeunt buckingham mayor and citizens catesby
call him again sweet prince accept their suit
if you deny them all the land will rue it
will you enforce me to a world of cares
i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul
re enter buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden whe er i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foul fac d reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this
we see it and will say it
in saying so you shall but say the truth
then i salute you with this royal title long live king richard england s worthy king
to morrow may it please you to be crown d
even when you please for you will have it so
to morrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave
to the bishops come let us to our holy work again

to anne come madam you must straight to westminster there to be crowned richard s royal queen
ah cut my lace asunder that my pent heart may have some scope to beat or else i swoon with this dead killing news
be of good cheer mother how fares your grace
o dorset speak not to me get thee gone
death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels thy mother s name is ominous to children
if thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas and live with richmond from the reach of hell
go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter house lest thou increase the number of the dead and make me die the thrall of margaret s curse nor mother wife nor england s counted queen
full of wise care is this your counsel madam
take all the swift advantage of the hours you shall have letters from me to my son in your behalf to meet you on the way
be not ta en tardy by unwise delay
o ill dispersing wind of misery
o my accursed womb the bed of death
a cockatrice hast thou hatch d to the world whose unavoided eye is murderous
come madam come i in all haste was sent
and i with all unwillingness will go
o would to god that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were red hot steel to sear me to the brains
anointed let me be with deadly venom and die ere men can say god save the queen
go go poor soul i envy not thy glory
to feed my humour wish thyself no harm
lo ere i can repeat this curse again within so small a time my woman s heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and prov d the subject of mine own soul s curse which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest for never yet one hour in his bed did i enjoy the golden dew of sleep but with his timorous dreams was still awak d
besides he hates me for my father warwick and will no doubt shortly be rid of me
no more than with my soul i mourn for yours
farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory
adieu poor soul that tak st thy leave of it
to dorset go thou to richmond and good fortune guide thee
to anne go thou to richard and good angels tend thee
to queen elizabeth go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee
i to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen and each hour s joy wreck d with a week of teen
stay yet look back with me unto the tower
pity you ancient stones those tender babes whom envy hath immur d within your walls rough cradle for such little pretty ones
rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow for tender princes use my babies well
so foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell
enter richard in pomp as king buckingham catesby ratcliff lovel a page and others king richard
sound thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated
but shall we wear these glories for a day or shall they last and we rejoice in them
still live they and for ever let them last
ah buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed
young edward lives think now what i would speak
why buckingham i say i would be king
why so you are my thrice renowned lord
o bitter consequence that edward still should live true noble prince
cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull
and i would have it suddenly perform d
your grace may do your pleasure
tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes
say have i thy consent that they shall die
give me some little breath some pause dear lord before i positively speak in this
i will resolve you herein presently
aside to another the king is angry see he gnaws his lip
i will converse with iron witted fools descends from the throne and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes
know st thou not any whom corrupting gold will tempt unto a close exploit of death
i know a discontented gentleman whose humble means match not his haughty spirit
gold were as good as twenty orators and will no doubt tempt him to anything
his name my lord is tyrrel
exit page the deep revolving witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbour to my counsels
hath he so long held out with me untir d and stops he now for breath
enter stanley how now lord stanley
know my loving lord the marquis dorset as i hear is fled to richmond in the parts where he abides
rumour it abroad that anne my wife is very grievous sick i will take order for her keeping close
inquire me out some mean poor gentleman whom i will marry straight to clarence daughter the boy is foolish and i fear not him
i say again give out that anne my queen is sick and like to die
about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me
exit catesby i must be married to my brother s daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass
murder her brothers and then marry her
but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin
tear falling pity dwells not in this eye
re enter page with tyrrel is thy name tyrrel
james tyrrel and your most obedient subject
dar st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine
please you but i had rather kill two enemies
two deep enemies foes to my rest and my sweet sleep s disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon
tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower
let me have open means to come to them and soon i ll rid you from the fear of them
whispers there is no more but so say it is done and i will love thee and prefer thee for it
my lord i have consider d in my mind the late request that you did sound me in
i hear the news my lord
stanley he is your wife s son well look unto it
my lord i claim the gift my due by promise for which your honour and your faith is pawn d th earldom of hereford and the movables which you have promised i shall possess
stanley look to your wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it
what says your highness to my just request
i do remember me henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy
how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him
my lord your promise for the earldom king richard
when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy show d me the castle and call d it rugemount at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promis d me
because that like a jack thou keep st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation
i am not in the giving vein to day
may it please you to resolve me in my suit
thou troublest me i am not in the vein
repays he my deep service with such contempt
made i him king for this
o let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock while my fearful head is on
the tyrannous and bloody act is done the most arch deed of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of
dighton and forrest who i did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery albeit they were flesh d villains bloody dogs melted with tenderness and mild compassion wept like two children in their deaths sad story
o thus quoth dighton lay the gentle babes thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another within their alabaster innocent arms
their lips were four red roses on a stalk and in their summer beauty kiss d each other
a book of prayers on their pillow lay which once quoth forrest almost chang d my mind but o the devil there the villain stopp d when dighton thus told on we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature that from the prime creation e er she framed
hence both are gone with conscience and remorse they could not speak and so i left them both to bear this tidings to the bloody king
enter king richard and here he comes
kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news
if to have done the thing you gave in charge beget your happiness be happy then for it is done
but didst thou see them dead
the chaplain of the tower hath buried them but where to say the truth i do not know
come to me tyrrel soon at after supper when thou shalt tell the process of their death
meantime but think how i may do thee good and be inheritor of thy desire
the son of clarence have i pent up close his daughter meanly have i match d in marriage the sons of edward sleep in abraham s bosom and anne my wife hath bid this world good night
now for i know the britaine richmond aims at young elizabeth my brother s daughter and by that knot looks proudly on the crown to her go i a jolly thriving wooer
good or bad news that thou com st in so bluntly
bad news my lord morton is fled to richmond and buckingham back d with the hardy welshmen is in the field and still his power increaseth
ely with richmond troubles me more near than buckingham and his rash levied strength
come i have learn d that fearful commenting is leaden servitor to dull delay delay leads impotent and snail pac d beggary
then fiery expedition be my wing jove s mercury and herald for a king
we must be brief when traitors brave the field
before the palace enter old queen margaret queen margaret
so now prosperity begins to mellow and drop into the rotten mouth of death
here in these confines slily have i lurk d to watch the waning of mine enemies
a dire induction am i witness to and will to france hoping the consequence will prove as bitter black and tragical
retires enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york queen elizabeth
my unblown flowers new appearing sweets
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fix d in doom perpetual hover about me with your airy wings and hear your mother s lamentation
hover about her say that right for right hath dimm d your infant morn to aged night
so many miseries have craz d my voice that my woe wearied tongue is still and mute
edward plantagenet why art thou dead
plantagenet doth quit plantagenet edward for edward pays a dying debt
wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
when holy harry died and my sweet son
dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost woe s scene world s shame grave s due by life usurp d brief abstract and record of tedious days rest thy unrest on england s lawful earth sitting down unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood
ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
then would i hide my bones not rest them here
ah who hath any cause to mourn but we
sitting down by her queen margaret
coming forward if ancient sorrow be most reverend give mine the benefit of seniory and let my griefs frown on the upper hand
if sorrow can admit society sitting down with them tell o er your woes again by viewing mine
i had an edward till a richard kill d him i had a husband till a richard kill d him thou hadst an edward till a richard kill d him thou hadst a richard till a richard kill d him
i had a richard too and thou didst kill him i had a rutland too thou holp st to kill him
thou hadst a clarence too and richard kill d him
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept a hell hound that doth hunt us all to death
that dog that had his teeth before his eyes to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood that foul defacer of god s handiwork that excellent grand tyrant of the earth that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
o upright just and true disposing god how do i thank thee that this carnal cur preys on the issue of his mother s body and makes her pew fellow with others moan
o harry s wife triumph not in my woes
god witness with me i have wept for thine
bear with me i am hungry for revenge and now i cloy me with beholding it
thy edward he is dead that kill d my edward the other edward dead to quit my edward young york he is but boot because both they match d not the high perfection of my loss
thy clarence he is dead that stabb d my edward and the beholders of this frantic play th adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey untimely smother d in their dusky graves
richard yet lives hell s black intelligencer only reserv d their factor to buy souls and send them thither
but at hand at hand ensues his piteous and unpitied end
earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray to have him suddenly convey d from hence
cancel his bond of life dear god i pray that i may live and say the dog is dead
o thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider that foul bunch back d toad
i call d thee then vain flourish of my fortune i call d thee then poor shadow painted queen the presentation of but what i was the flattering index of a direful pageant one heav d a high to be hurl d down below a mother only mock d with two fair babes a dream of what thou wast a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot a sign of dignity a breath a bubble a queen in jest only to fill the scene
who sues and kneels and says god save the queen
where be the bending peers that flattered thee
where be the thronging troops that followed thee
decline an this and see what now thou art for happy wife a most distressed widow for joyful mother one that wails the name for one being su d to one that humbly sues for queen a very caitiff crown d with care for she that scorn d at me now scorn d of me for she being fear d of all now fearing one for she commanding all obey d of none
thus hath the course of justice whirl d about and left thee but a very prey to time having no more but thought of what thou wast to torture thee the more being what thou art
thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
now thy proud neck bears half my burden d yoke from which even here i slip my weary head and leave the burden of it all on thee
farewell york s wife and queen of sad mischance these english woes shall make me smile in france
o thou well skill d in curses stay awhile and teach me how to curse mine enemies
forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days compare dead happiness with living woe think that thy babes were sweeter than they were and he that slew them fouler than he is
bett ring thy loss makes the bad causer worse revolving this will teach thee how to curse
my words are dull o quicken them with thine
thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
why should calamity be fun of words
windy attorneys to their client woes airy succeeders of intestate joys poor breathing orators of miseries let them have scope though what they will impart help nothing else yet do they case the heart
if so then be not tongue tied
go with me and in the breath of bitter words let s smother my damned son that thy two sweet sons smother d
the trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims
enter king richard and his train marching with drums and trumpets king richard
who intercepts me in my expedition
o she that might have intercepted thee by strangling thee in her accursed womb from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown where t should be branded if that right were right the slaughter of the prince that ow d that crown and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
tell me thou villain slave where are my children
thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence
and little ned plantagenet his son
where is the gentle rivers vaughan grey
let not the heavens hear these tell tale women rail on the lord s anointed
alarums either be patient and entreat me fair or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations
ay i thank god my father and yourself
madam i have a touch of your condition that cannot brook the accent of reproof
do then but i ll not hear
i will be mild and gentle in my words
and brief good mother for i am in haste
i have stay d for thee god knows in torment and in agony
and came i not at last to comfort you
no by the holy rood thou know st it well thou cam st on earth to make the earth my hell
a grievous burden was thy birth to me tetchy and wayward was thy infancy thy school days frightful desp rate wild and furious thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous thy age confirm d proud subtle sly and bloody more mild but yet more harmful kind in hatred
what comfortable hour canst thou name that ever grac d me with thy company
faith none but humphrey hour that call d your grace to breakfast once forth of my company
if i be so disgracious in your eye let me march on and not offend you madam
hear me a word for i shall never speak to thee again
either thou wilt die by god s just ordinance ere from this war thou turn a conqueror or i with grief and extreme age shall perish and never more behold thy face again
therefore take with thee my most grievous curse which in the day of battle tire thee more than all the complete armour that thou wear st
my prayers on the adverse party fight and there the little souls of edward s children whisper the spirits of thine enemies and promise them success and victory
bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse abides in me i say amen to her
stay madam i must talk a word with you
i have no moe sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter
for my daughters richard they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens and therefore level not to hit their lives
you have a daughter call d elizabeth
virtuous and fair royal and gracious
and must she die for this
o let her live and i ll corrupt her manners stain her beauty slander myself as false to edward s bed throw over her the veil of infamy so she may live unscarr d of bleeding slaughter i will confess she was not edward s daughter
wrong not her birth she is a royal princess
to save her life i ll say she is not so
her life is safest only in her birth
and only in that safety died her brothers
lo at their birth good stars were opposite
no to their lives ill friends were contrary
all unavoided is the doom of destiny
true when avoided grace makes destiny
my babes were destin d to a fairer death if grace had bless d thee with a fairer life
you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
cousins indeed and by their uncle cozen d of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
whose hand soever lanc d their tender hearts thy head an indirectly gave direction
no doubt the murd rous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs
but that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchor d in thine eyes and i in such a desp rate bay of death like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
madam so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars as i intend more good to you and yours than ever you or yours by me were harm d
what good is cover d with the face of heaven to be discover d that can do me good
advancement of your children gentle lady
up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
unto the dignity and height of fortune the high imperial type of this earth s glory
flatter my sorrow with report of it tell me what state what dignity what honour canst thou demise to any child of mine
even all i have ay and myself and all will i withal endow a child of thine so in the lethe of thy angry soul thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs which thou supposest i have done to thee
be brief lest that the process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness date
then know that from my soul i love thy daughter
my daughter s mother thinks it with her soul
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
so from thy soul s love didst thou love her brothers and from my heart s love i do thank thee for it
be not so hasty to confound my meaning
i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter and do intend to make her queen of england
well then who dost thou mean shall be her king
even he that makes her queen
that would i learn of you as one being best acquainted with her humour
and wilt thou learn of me
send to her by the man that slew her brothers a pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave edward and york
then haply will she weep therefore present to her as sometimes margaret did to thy father steep d in rutland s blood a handkerchief which say to her did drain the purple sap from her sweet brother s body and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
if this inducement move her not to love send her a letter of thy noble deeds tell her thou mad st away her uncle clarence her uncle rivers ay and for her sake mad st quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
you mock me madam this is not the way to win your daughter
there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard that hath done all this
say that i did all this for love of her
nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil
look what is done cannot be now amended
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes which after hours gives leisure to repent
if i did take the kingdom from your sons to make amends i ll give it to your daughter
if i have kill d the issue of your womb to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
a grandam s name is little less in love than is the doating title of a mother they are as children but one step below even of your metal of your very blood of all one pain save for a night of groans endur d of her for whom you bid like sorrow
your children were vexation to your youth but mine shall be a comfort to your age
the loss you have is but a son being king and by that loss your daughter is made queen
i cannot make you what amends i would therefore accept such kindness as i can
dorset your son that with a fearful soul leads discontented steps in foreign soil this fair alliance quickly shall can home to high promotions and great dignity
the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife familiarly shall call thy dorset brother again shall you be mother to a king and all the ruins of distressful times repair d with double riches of content
we have many goodly days to see
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed shall come again transform d to orient pearl advantaging their loan with interest of ten times double gain of happiness
go then my mother to thy daughter go make bold her bashful years with your experience prepare her ears to hear a wooer s tale put in her tender heart th aspiring flame of golden sovereignty acquaint the princes with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel dull brain d buckingham bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conqueror s bed to whom i will retail my conquest won and she shall be sole victoress caesar s caesar
what were i best to say
her father s brother would be her lord
or shall i say her uncle
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honour and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years
infer fair england s peace by this alliance
which she shall purchase with still lasting war
tell her the king that may command entreats
that at her hands which the king s king forbids
say she shall be a high and mighty queen
to wail the title as her mother doth
say i will love her everlastingly
but how long shall that title ever last
sweetly in force unto her fair life s end
but how long fairly shall her sweet life last
as long as heaven and nature lengthens it
as long as hell and richard likes of it
say i her sovereign am her subject low
but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
be eloquent in my behalf to her
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
then plainly to her tell my loving tale
plain and not honest is too harsh a style
your reasons are too shallow and too quick
o no my reasons are too deep and dead too deep and dead poor infants in their graves
harp not on that string madam that is past
harp on it still shall i till heartstrings break
now by my george my garter and my crown queen elizabeth
profan d dishonour d and the third usurp d
by nothing for this is no oath thy george profan d hath lost his lordly honour thy garter blemish d pawn d his knightly virtue thy crown usurp d disgrac d his kingly glory
if something thou wouldst swear to be believ d swear then by something that thou hast not wrong d
then by my self queen elizabeth
now by the world queen elizabeth
tis full of thy foul wrongs
my father s death queen elizabeth
thy life hath it dishonour d
why then by god queen elizabeth
god s wrong is most of all
if thou didst fear to break an oath with him the unity the king my husband made thou hadst not broken nor my brothers died
if thou hadst fear d to break an oath by him th imperial metal circling now thy head had grac d the tender temples of my child and both the princes had been breathing here which now two tender bedfellows for dust thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms
what canst thou swear by now
that thou hast wronged in the time o erpast for i myself have many tears to wash hereafter time for time past wrong d by thee
the children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter d ungovern d youth to wail it in their age the parents live whose children thou hast butcheed old barren plants to wail it with their age
swear not by time to come for that thou hast misus d ere us d by times ill us d o erpast
as i intend to prosper and repent so thrive i in my dangerous affairs of hostile arms
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
be opposite all planets of good luck to my proceeding if with dear heart s love immaculate devotion holy thoughts i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
in her consists my happiness and thine without her follows to myself and thee herself the land and many a christian soul death desolation ruin and decay
it cannot be avoided but by this it will not be avoided but by this
therefore dear mother i must call you so be the attorney of my love to her plead what i will be not what i have been not my deserts but what i will deserve
urge the necessity and state of times and be not peevish fond in great designs
shall i be tempted of the devil thus
ay if the devil tempt you to do good
shall i forget myself to be myself
ay if your self s remembrance wrong yourself
yet thou didst kill my children
but in your daughter s womb i bury them where in that nest of spicery they will breed selves of themselves to your recomforture
shall i go win my daughter to thy will
and be a happy mother by the deed
write to me very shortly and you shall understand from me her mind
bear her my true love s kiss and so farewell

richard starts out of his dream king richard
o coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
richard loves richard that is i am i
great reason why lest i revenge
for any good that i myself have done unto myself
alas i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself
i am a villain yet i lie i am not
my conscience hath a thousand several tongues and every tongue brings in a several tale and every tale condemns me for a villain
perjury perjury in the high st degree murder stern murder in the dir st degree all several sins all us d in each degree throng to the bar crying all guilty
there is no creature loves me and if i die no soul will pity me and wherefore should they since that i myself find in myself no pity to myself
methought the souls of all that i had murder d came to my tent and every one did threat to morrow s vengeance on the head of richard
the early village cock hath twice done salutation to the morn your friends are up and buckle on their armour
o ratcliff i have dream d a fearful dream
what think st thou will our friends prove all true
o ratcliff i fear i fear
nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows

exeunt enter the lords to richmond sitting in his tent lords
cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen that you have ta en a tardy sluggard here
how have you slept my lord
the sweetest sleep and fairest boding dreams that ever ent red in a drowsy head have i since your departure had my lords
methought their souls whose bodies richard murder d came to my tent and cried on victory
i promise you my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream
how far into the morning is it lords
why then tis time to arm and give direction
his oration to his soldiers more than i have said loving countrymen the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon yet remember this god and our good cause fight upon our side the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls like high rear d bulwarks stand before our faces richard except those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow
for what is he they follow
truly gentlemen a bloody tyrant and a homicide one rais d in blood and one in blood establish d one that made means to come by what he hath and slaughtered those that were the means to help him a base foul stone made precious by the foil of england s chair where he is falsely set one that hath ever been god s enemy
then if you fight against god s enemy god will in justice ward you as his soldiers if you do sweat to put a tyrant down you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain if you do fight against your country s foes your country s foes shall pay your pains the hire if you do fight in safeguard of your wives your wives shall welcome home the conquerors if you do free your children from the sword your children s children quits it in your age
then in the name of god and all these rights advance your standards draw your willing swords
for me the ransom of my bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on the earth s cold face but if i thrive the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof

king he was in the right and so indeed it is
clock strikes tell the clock there
who saw the sun to day
then he disdains to shine for by the book he should have brav d the east an hour ago
a black day will it be to somebody
the sun will not be seen to day the sky doth frown and lour upon our army
i would these dewy tears were from the ground
why what is that to me more than to richmond
for the selfsame heaven that frowns on me looks sadly upon him
arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
come bustle bustle caparison my horse call up lord stanley bid him bring his power
i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain and thus my battle shall be ordered my foreward shall be drawn out all in length consisting equally of horse and foot our archers shall be placed in the midst
john duke of norfolk thomas earl of surrey shall have the leading of this foot and horse
they thus directed we will follow in the main battle whose puissance on either side shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
this and saint george to boot
this found i on my tent this morning
he sheweth him a paper king richard

his oration to his army what shall i say more than i have inferr d
remember whom you are to cope withal a sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways a scum of britaines and base lackey peasants whom their o er cloyed country vomits forth to desperate adventures and assur d destruction
you sleeping safe they bring to you unrest you having lands and bless d with beauteous wives they would restrain the one distain the other
and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow long kept in britaine at our mother s cost
a milk sop one that never in his life felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
let s whip these stragglers o er the seas again lash hence these over weening rags of france these famish d beggars weary of their lives who but for dreaming on this fond exploit for want of means poor rats had hang d themselves
if we be conquered let men conquer us and not these bastard britaines whom our fathers have in their own land beaten bobb d and thump d and in record left them the heirs of shame
lie with our wives ravish our daughters
draw archers draw your arrows to the head
spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood amaze the welkin with your broken staves

what traitor hears me and says not amen
england hath long been mad and scarr d herself the brother blindly shed the brother s blood the father rashly slaughter d his own son the son compell d been butcher to the sire all this divided york and lancaster divided in their dire division o now let richmond and elizabeth the true succeeders of each royal house by god s fair ordinance conjoin together
and let their heirs god if thy will be so enrich the time to come with smooth fac d peace with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
abate the edge of traitors gracious lord that would reduce these bloody days again and make poor england weep in streams of blood
let them not live to taste this land s increase that would with treason wound this fair land s peace
now civil wounds are stopp d peace lives again that she may long live here god say amen

’tis all one i will show myself a tyrant when i have fought with the men i will be civil with the maids i will cut off their heads
ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads take it in what sense thou wilt
they must take it in sense that feel it
me they shall feel while i am able to stand and ’tis known i am a pretty piece of flesh
’tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor john
draw thy tool here comes of the house of montagues
my naked weapon is out quarrel i will back thee
let us take the law of our sides let them begin
i will frown as i pass by and let them take it as they list
i will bite my thumb at them which is disgrace to them if they bear it
do you bite your thumb at us sir
i do bite my thumb sir
do you bite your thumb at us sir
is the law of our side if i say ay
no sir i do not bite my thumb at you sir but i bite my thumb sir
but if you do sir i am for you
i serve as good a man as you
say better here comes one of my master’s kinsmen
put up your swords you know not what you do
beats down their swords enter tybalt
what art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
turn thee benvolio look upon thy death
i do but keep the peace put up thy sword or manage it to part these men with me
what drawn and talk of peace
i hate the word as i hate hell all montagues and thee have at thee coward
they fight enter three or four citizens with clubs
enter capulet in his gown and lady capulet
give me my long sword ho
why call you for a sword
old montague is come and flourishes his blade in spite of me
enter montague and his lady montague
hold me not let me go
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
rebellious subjects enemies to peace profaners of this neighbour stained steel — will they not hear
you men you beasts that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins on pain of torture from those bloody hands throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground and hear the sentence of your moved prince
three civil brawls bred of an airy word by thee old capulet and montague have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets and made verona’s ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans in hands as old canker’d with peace to part your canker’d hate
if ever you disturb our streets again your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
for this time all the rest depart away you capulet shall go along with me and montague come you this afternoon to know our farther pleasure in this case to old free town our common judgement place
once more on pain of death all men depart
exeunt prince and attendants capulet lady capulet tybalt citizens and servants montague
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
speak nephew were you by when it began
here were the servants of your adversary and yours close fighting ere i did approach
i drew to part them in the instant came the fiery tybalt with his sword prepar’d which as he breath’d defiance to my ears he swung about his head and cut the winds who nothing hurt withal hiss’d him in scorn
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows came more and more and fought on part and part till the prince came who parted either part
o where is romeo saw you him today
right glad i am he was not at this fray
madam an hour before the worshipp’d sun peer’d forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from this city side so early walking did i see your son
towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood
i measuring his affections by my own which then most sought where most might not be found being one too many by my weary self pursu’d my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me
many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the all cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora’s bed away from light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out and makes himself an artificial night
black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove
my noble uncle do you know the cause
i neither know it nor can learn of him
have you importun’d him by any means
both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections’ counsellor is to himself—i will not say how true— but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know
so please you step aside i’ll know his grievance or be much denied
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift
come madam let’s away exeunt montague and lady montague benvolio
ay me sad hours seem long
was that my father that went hence so fast
not having that which having makes them short
out of her favour where i am in love
alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will
yet tell me not for i have heard it all
here’s much to do with hate but more with love why then o brawling love
o anything of nothing first create
misshapen chaos of well seeming forms
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
still waking sleep that is not what it is
this love feel i that feel no love in this
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine
this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own
love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs being purg’d a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes being vex’d a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears what is it else
a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet
i will go along and if you leave me so you do me wrong
i have lost myself i am not here
this is not romeo he’s some other where
tell me in sadness who is that you love
what shall i groan and tell thee
why no but sadly tell me who
bid a sick man in sadness make his will a word ill urg’d to one that is so ill
in sadness cousin i do love a woman
i aim’d so near when i suppos’d you lov’d
a right good markman and she’s fair i love
a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
well in that hit you miss she’ll not be hit with cupid’s arrow she hath dian’s wit and in strong proof of chastity well arm’d from love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d
she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold o she’s rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starv’d with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now
be rul’d by me forget to think of her
o teach me how i should forget to think
by giving liberty unto thine eyes examine other beauties
’tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows being black puts us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass’d that passing fair
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget
i’ll pay that doctrine or else die in debt
but montague is bound as well as i in penalty alike and ’tis not hard i think for men so old as we to keep the peace
of honourable reckoning are you both and pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long
but now my lord what say you to my suit
but saying o’er what i have said before
my child is yet a stranger in the world she hath not seen the change of fourteen years let two more summers wither in their pride ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
younger than she are happy mothers made
and too soon marr’d are those so early made
the earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she she is the hopeful lady of my earth but woo her gentle paris get her heart my will to her consent is but a part and she agree within her scope of choice lies my consent and fair according voice
this night i hold an old accustom’d feast whereto i have invited many a guest such as i love and you among the store one more most welcome makes my number more
at my poor house look to behold this night earth treading stars that make dark heaven light such comfort as do lusty young men feel when well apparell’d april on the heel of limping winter treads even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house
hear all all see and like her most whose merit most shall be which on more view of many mine being one may stand in number though in reckoning none
go sirrah trudge about through fair verona find those persons out whose names are written there gives a paper and to them say my house and welcome on their pleasure stay
find them out whose names are written here
it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ
tut man one fire burns out another’s burning one pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish turn giddy and be holp by backward turning one desperate grief cures with another’s languish take thou some new infection to thy eye and the rank poison of the old will die
your plantain leaf is excellent for that
not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whipp’d and tormented and—god den good fellow
i pray sir can you read
ay mine own fortune in my misery
perhaps you have learned it without book
but i pray can you read anything you see
ay if i know the letters and the language
ye say honestly rest you merry
he reads the letter signior martino and his wife and daughters county anselmo and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of utruvio signior placentio and his lovely nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece rosaline and livia signior valentio and his cousin tybalt lucio and the lively helena
gives back the paper whither should they come
indeed i should have ask’d you that before
now i’ll tell you without asking
my master is the great rich capulet and if you be not of the house of montagues i pray come and crush a cup of wine
at this same ancient feast of capulet’s sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lov’st with all the admired beauties of verona
go thither and with unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show and i will make thee think thy swan a crow
when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fire and these who often drown’d could never die transparent heretics be burnt for liars
the all seeing sun ne’er saw her match since first the world begun
tut you saw her fair none else being by herself pois’d with herself in either eye but in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d your lady’s love against some other maid that i will show you shining at this feast and she shall scant show well that now shows best
i’ll go along no such sight to be shown but to rejoice in splendour of my own
now by my maidenhead at twelve year old i bade her come
nurse give leave awhile we must talk in secret
nurse come back again i have remember’d me thou’s hear our counsel
thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age
faith i can tell her age unto an hour
i’ll lay fourteen of my teeth and yet to my teen be it spoken i have but four she is not fourteen
how long is it now to lammas tide
even or odd of all days in the year come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen
susan and she —god rest all christian souls — were of an age
well susan is with god she was too good for me
but as i said on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen that shall she marry i remember it well
’tis since the earthquake now eleven years and she was wean’d —i never shall forget it— of all the days of the year upon that day for i had then laid wormwood to my dug sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall my lord and you were then at mantua nay i do bear a brain
but as i said when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
shake quoth the dovehouse ’twas no need i trow to bid me trudge
and since that time it is eleven years for then she could stand alone nay by th’rood she could have run and waddled all about for even the day before she broke her brow and then my husband —god be with his soul
a was a merry man —took up the child ‘yea ’ quoth he ‘dost thou fall upon thy face
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit wilt thou not jule ’ and by my holidame the pretty wretch left crying and said ‘ay’
to see now how a jest shall come about
i warrant and i should live a thousand years i never should forget it
‘wilt thou not jule ’ quoth he and pretty fool it stinted and said ‘ay ’ lady capulet
enough of this i pray thee hold thy peace
yes madam yet i cannot choose but laugh to think it should leave crying and say ‘ay’ and yet i warrant it had upon it brow a bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone a perilous knock and it cried bitterly
‘yea ’ quoth my husband ‘fall’st upon thy face
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age wilt thou not jule ’ it stinted and said ‘ay’
and stint thou too i pray thee nurse say i
god mark thee to his grace thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er i nurs’d and i might live to see thee married once i have my wish
marry that marry is the very theme i came to talk of
tell me daughter juliet how stands your disposition to be married
it is an honour that i dream not of
were not i thine only nurse i would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat
well think of marriage now younger than you here in verona ladies of esteem are made already mothers
by my count i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid
thus then in brief the valiant paris seeks you for his love
lady such a man as all the world—why he’s a man of wax
verona’s summer hath not such a flower
nay he’s a flower in faith a very flower
what say you can you love the gentleman
this night you shall behold him at our feast read o’er the volume of young paris’ face and find delight writ there with beauty’s pen
examine every married lineament and see how one another lends content and what obscur’d in this fair volume lies find written in the margent of his eyes
this precious book of love this unbound lover to beautify him only lacks a cover the fish lives in the sea and ’tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide
that book in many’s eyes doth share the glory that in gold clasps locks in the golden story so shall you share all that he doth possess by having him making yourself no less
speak briefly can you like of paris’ love
i’ll look to like if looking liking move but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly
madam the guests are come supper served up you called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in the pantry and everything in extremity
i must hence to wait i beseech you follow straight
exit servant juliet the county stays
go girl seek happy nights to happy days
enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six maskers torch bearers and others
what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
or shall we on without apology
the date is out of such prolixity we’ll have no cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf bearing a tartar’s painted bow of lath scaring the ladies like a crow keeper nor no without book prologue faintly spoke after the prompter for our entrance but let them measure us by what they will we’ll measure them a measure and be gone
give me a torch i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light
nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
you are a lover borrow cupid’s wings and soar with them above a common bound
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
under love’s heavy burden do i sink
and to sink in it should you burden love too great oppression for a tender thing
it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down
give me a case to put my visage in putting on a mask a visor for a visor
what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
come knock and enter and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs
a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase i’ll be a candle holder and look on the game was ne’er so fair and i am done
tut dun’s the mouse the constable’s own word if thou art dun we’ll draw thee from the mire or save your reverence love wherein thou stickest up to the ears
i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain light lights by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits
and we mean well in going to this mask but ’tis no wit to go
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
o then i see queen mab hath been with you
this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elf locks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she — romeo
peace peace mercutio peace thou talk’st of nothing
true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being anger’d puffs away from thence turning his side to the dew dropping south
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late
i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night’s revels and expire the term of a despised life clos’d in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death
but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my suit
exeunt scene v a hall in capulet’s house
where’s potpan that he helps not to take away
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands and they unwash’d too ’tis a foul thing
away with the join stools remove the court cupboard look to the plate
good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou loves me let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell
you are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber
we cannot be here and there too
be brisk awhile and the longer liver take all
exeunt enter capulet c with the guests and gentlewomen to the maskers
welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you
ah my mistresses which of you all will now deny to dance
she that makes dainty she i’ll swear hath corns
am i come near ye now
i have seen the day that i have worn a visor and could tell a whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear such as would please ’tis gone ’tis gone ’tis gone you are welcome gentlemen
a hall a hall give room
music plays and they dance more light you knaves and turn the tables up and quench the fire the room is grown too hot
ah sirrah this unlook’d for sport comes well
nay sit nay sit good cousin capulet for you and i are past our dancing days how long is’t now since last yourself and i were in a mask
what man ’tis not so much ’tis not so much ’tis since the nuptial of lucentio come pentecost as quickly as it will some five and twenty years and then we mask’d
’tis more ’tis more his son is elder sir his son is thirty
his son was but a ward two years ago
what lady is that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight
o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night as a rich jewel in an ethiop’s ear beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady o’er her fellows shows
the measure done i’ll watch her place of stand and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
did my heart love till now
for i ne’er saw true beauty till this night
this by his voice should be a montague
what dares the slave come hither cover’d with an antic face to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
now by the stock and honour of my kin to strike him dead i hold it not a sin
uncle this is a montague our foe a villain that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night
content thee gentle coz let him alone a bears him like a portly gentleman and to say truth verona brags of him to be a virtuous and well govern’d youth
i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement
therefore be patient take no note of him it is my will the which if thou respect show a fair presence and put off these frowns an ill beseeming semblance for a feast
it fits when such a villain is a guest i’ll not endure him
i say he shall go to am i the master here or you
god shall mend my soul you’ll make a mutiny among my guests
you will set cock a hoop you’ll be the man
this trick may chance to scathe you i know what
well said my hearts —you are a princox go be quiet or—more light more light —for shame
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
i will withdraw but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
to juliet if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle sin is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
saints do not move though grant for prayers’ sake
then move not while my prayer’s effect i take
thus from my lips by thine my sin is purg’d
then have my lips the sin that they have took
madam your mother craves a word with you
marry bachelor her mother is the lady of the house and a good lady and a wise and virtuous
i nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal
i tell you he that can lay hold of her shall have the chinks
my life is my foe’s debt
away be gone the sport is at the best
ay so i fear the more is my unrest
nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone we have a trifling foolish banquet towards
why then i thank you all i thank you honest gentlemen good night
come on then let’s to bed
ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late i’ll to my rest
exeunt all but juliet and nurse juliet
the son and heir of old tiberio
what’s he that now is going out of door
marry that i think be young petruchio
what’s he that follows here that would not dance
if he be married my grave is like to be my wedding bed
his name is romeo and a montague the only son of your great enemy
my only love sprung from my only hate
too early seen unknown and known too late
prodigious birth of love it is to me that i must love a loathed enemy
a rhyme i learn’d even now of one i danc’d withal
come let’s away the strangers all are gone
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie and young affection gapes to be his heir that fair for which love groan’d for and would die with tender juliet match’d is now not fair
now romeo is belov’d and loves again alike bewitched by the charm of looks but to his foe suppos’d he must complain and she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks being held a foe he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear and she as much in love her means much less to meet her new beloved anywhere
but passion lends them power time means to meet tempering extremities with extreme sweet
an open place adjoining capulet’s garden
can i go forward when my heart is here
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
he climbs the wall and leaps down within it enter benvolio and mercutio
he is wise and on my life hath stol’n him home to bed
he ran this way and leap’d this orchard wall call good mercutio
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied cry but ‘ah me ’ pronounce but love and dove speak to my gossip venus one fair word one nickname for her purblind son and heir young abraham cupid he that shot so trim when king cophetua lov’d the beggar maid
he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not the ape is dead and i must conjure him
i conjure thee by rosaline’s bright eyes by her high forehead and her scarlet lip by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh and the demesnes that there adjacent lie that in thy likeness thou appear to us
an if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
’twould anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle of some strange nature letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjur’d it down that were some spite
my invocation is fair and honest and in his mistress’ name i conjure only but to raise up him
come he hath hid himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night
blind is his love and best befits the dark
if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
o romeo that she were o that she were an open arse and thou a poperin pear
this field bed is too cold for me to sleep
go then for ’tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found
he jests at scars that never felt a wound
juliet appears above at a window
but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she
be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off
it is my lady o it is my love
o that she knew she were
she speaks yet she says nothing
her eye discourses i will answer it
i am too bold ’tis not to me she speaks
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return
what if her eyes were there they in her head
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek
o speak again bright angel for thou art as glorious to this night being o’er my head as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the white upturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air
o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and i’ll no longer be a capulet
aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this
’tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague
it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man
that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet so romeo would were he not romeo call’d retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title
romeo doff thy name and for thy name which is no part of thee take all myself
i take thee at thy word
call me but love and i’ll be new baptis’d henceforth i never will be romeo
what man art thou that thus bescreen’d in night so stumblest on my counsel
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee
had i it written i would tear the word
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of thy tongue’s utterance yet i know the sound
art thou not romeo and a montague
neither fair maid if either thee dislike
how cam’st thou hither tell me and wherefore
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here
with love’s light wings did i o’erperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
if they do see thee they will murder thee
alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords
look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity
i would not for the world they saw thee here
i have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes and but thou love me let them find me here
my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love
by whose direction found’st thou out this place
by love that first did prompt me to enquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea i should adventure for such merchandise
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment
i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word
yet if thou swear’st thou mayst prove false
at lovers’ perjuries they say jove laughs
o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won i’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond and therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light but trust me gentleman i’ll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess but that thou overheard’st ere i was ’ware my true love passion therefore pardon me and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark night hath so discovered
lady by yonder blessed moon i vow that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops — juliet
o swear not by the moon th’inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and i’ll believe thee
if my heart’s dear love — juliet
although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvis’d too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens
this bud of love by summer’s ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it and yet i would it were to give again
but to be frank and give it thee again
and yet i wish but for the thing i have my bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite
nurse calls within anon good nurse —sweet montague be true
stay but a little i will come again
i am afeard being in night all this is but a dream too flattering sweet to be substantial
three words dear romeo and good night indeed
if that thy bent of love be honourable thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow by one that i’ll procure to come to thee where and what time thou wilt perform the rite and all my fortunes at thy foot i’ll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world
i come anon — but if thou meanest not well i do beseech thee — nurse
by and by i come— to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief
so thrive my soul — juliet
a thousand times the worse to want thy light
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love towards school with heavy looks
retiring slowly re enter juliet above
o for a falconer’s voice to lure this tassel gentle back again
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud else would i tear the cave where echo lies and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine with repetition of my romeo’s name
it is my soul that calls upon my name
how silver sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night like softest music to attending ears
what o’clock tomorrow shall i send to thee
i have forgot why i did call thee back
let me stand here till thou remember it
i shall forget to have thee still stand there remembering how i love thy company
and i’ll still stay to have thee still forget forgetting any other home but this
’tis almost morning i would have thee gone and yet no farther than a wanton’s bird that lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so loving jealous of his liberty
i would i were thy bird
sweet so would i yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
parting is such sweet sorrow that i shall say good night till it be morrow
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
the grey ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light and darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels from forth day’s pathway made by titan’s wheels hence will i to my ghostly sire’s cell his help to crave and my dear hap to tell
enter friar lawrence with a basket
now ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers
the earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb what is her burying grave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find
many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities
for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but strain’d from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometime’s by action dignified
within the infant rind of this weak flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart
two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs —grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
young son it argues a distemper’d head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous’d with some distemperature or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed tonight
that last is true the sweeter rest was mine
i have forgot that name and that name’s woe
but where hast thou been then
i’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
i have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me that’s by me wounded
both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies
i bear no hatred blessed man for lo my intercession likewise steads my foe
be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet
as mine on hers so hers is set on mine and all combin’d save what thou must combine by holy marriage
when and where and how we met we woo’d and made exchange of vow i’ll tell thee as we pass but this i pray that thou consent to marry us today
is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken
young men’s love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
jesu maria what a deal of brine hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it doth not taste
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet
if ere thou wast thyself and these woes thine thou and these woes were all for rosaline and art thou chang’d
pronounce this sentence then women may fall when there’s no strength in men
thou chidd’st me oft for loving rosaline
for doting not for loving pupil mine
not in a grave to lay one in another out to have
i pray thee chide me not her i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow
o she knew well thy love did read by rote that could not spell
but come young waverer come go with me in one respect i’ll thy assistant be for this alliance may so happy prove to turn your households’ rancour to pure love
o let us hence i stand on sudden haste
wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
where the devil should this romeo be
not to his father’s i spoke with his man
why that same pale hard hearted wench that rosaline torments him so that he will sure run mad
tybalt the kinsman to old capulet hath sent a letter to his father’s house
any man that can write may answer a letter
nay he will answer the letter’s master how he dares being dared
alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a white wench’s black eye run through the ear with a love song the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow boy’s butt shaft
and is he a man to encounter tybalt
o he’s the courageous captain of compliments
he fights as you sing prick song keeps time distance and proportion
he rests his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause
ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the hay
the pox of such antic lisping affecting phantasies these new tuners of accent
by jesu a very good blade a very tall man a very good whore
why is not this a lamentable thing grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies these fashion mongers these pardon me’s who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench
here comes romeo here comes romeo
without his roe like a dried herring
o flesh flesh how art thou fishified
now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in
laura to his lady was but a kitchen wench —marry she had a better love to berhyme her dido a dowdy cleopatra a gypsy helen and hero hildings and harlots thisbe a grey eye or so but not to the purpose
there’s a french salutation to your french slop
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
what counterfeit did i give you
the slip sir the slip can you not conceive
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
that’s as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams
thou hast most kindly hit it
nay i am the very pink of courtesy
why then is my pump well flowered
sure wit follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing solely singular
o single soled jest solely singular for the singleness
come between us good benvolio my wits faint
swits and spurs swits and spurs or i’ll cry a match
nay if thy wits run the wild goose chase i am done
for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than i am sure i have in my whole five
was i with you there for the goose
thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce
and is it not then well served in to a sweet goose
o here’s a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad
i stretch it out for that word broad which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
why is not this better now than groaning for love
now art thou sociable now art thou romeo not art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
o thou art deceived i would have made it short for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
two two a shirt and a smock
good peter to hide her face for her fan’s the fairer face
god ye good den fair gentlewoman
’tis no less i tell ye for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon
one gentlewoman that god hath made for himself to mar
by my troth it is well said for himself to mar quoth a
gentlemen can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo
i can tell you but young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him
i am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse
very well took i’faith wisely wisely
if you be he sir i desire some confidence with you
she will endite him to some supper
a bawd a bawd a bawd
no hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent
sings an old hare hoar and an old hare hoar is very good meat in lent but a hare that is hoar is too much for a score when it hoars ere it be spent
romeo will you come to your father’s
farewell ancient lady farewell lady lady lady
i pray you sir what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery
a gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month
and a speak anything against me i’ll take him down and a were lustier than he is and twenty such jacks
and if i cannot i’ll find those that shall
i am none of his flirt gills i am none of his skains mates —and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure
i saw no man use you at his pleasure if i had my weapon should quickly have been out
i warrant you i dare draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side
now afore god i am so vexed that every part about me quivers
pray you sir a word and as i told you my young lady bid me enquire you out what she bade me say i will keep to myself
but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behaviour as they say for the gentlewoman is young
and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman and very weak dealing
nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress
i protest unto thee — nurse
good heart and i’faith i will tell her as much
lord lord she will be a joyful woman
what wilt thou tell her nurse
i will tell her sir that you do protest which as i take it is a gentlemanlike offer
bid her devise some means to come to shrift this afternoon and there she shall at friar lawrence’ cell be shriv’d and married
no truly sir not a penny
go to i say you shall
and stay good nurse behind the abbey wall
within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night
farewell be trusty and i’ll quit thy pains farewell commend me to thy mistress
now god in heaven bless thee
what say’st thou my dear nurse
did you ne’er hear say two may keep counsel putting one away
i warrant thee my man’s as true as steel
well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady
when ’twas a little prating thing —o there is a nobleman in town one paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief see a toad a very toad as see him
i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man but i’ll warrant you when i say so she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world
doth not rosemary and romeo begin both with a letter
r is for the—no i know it begins with some other letter and she hath the prettiest sententious of it of you and rosemary that it would do you good to hear it
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse in half an hour she promised to return
love’s heralds should be thoughts which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams driving back shadows over lowering hills therefore do nimble pinion’d doves draw love and therefore hath the wind swift cupid wings
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day’s journey and from nine till twelve is three long hours yet she is not come
had she affections and warm youthful blood she’d be as swift in motion as a ball my words would bandy her to my sweet love and his to me
but old folks many feign as they were dead unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
now good sweet nurse —o lord why look’st thou sad
though news be sad yet tell them merrily if good thou sham’st the music of sweet news by playing it to me with so sour a face
i am aweary give me leave awhile fie how my bones ache
what a jaunt have i had
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak
can you not stay a while
do you not see that i am out of breath
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
is thy news good or bad
answer to that say either and i’ll stay the circumstance
let me be satisfied is’t good or bad
well you have made a simple choice you know not how to choose a man
though his face be better than any man’s yet his leg excels all men’s and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare
he is not the flower of courtesy but i’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb
go thy ways wench serve god
what have you dined at home
but all this did i know before
what says he of our marriage
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
my back o’ t’other side —o my back my back
beshrew your heart for sending me about to catch my death with jauncing up and down
i’faith i am sorry that thou art not well
sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and i warrant a virtuous —where is your mother
‘your love says like an honest gentleman ‘where is your mother ’ nurse
o god’s lady dear are you so hot
is this the poultice for my aching bones
have you got leave to go to shrift today
then hie you hence to friar lawrence’ cell there stays a husband to make you a wife
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks they’ll be in scarlet straight at any news
i must another way to fetch a ladder by the which your love must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark
i am the drudge and toil in your delight but you shall bear the burden soon at night
i’ll to dinner hie you to the cell
so smile the heavens upon this holy act that after hours with sorrow chide us not
amen amen but come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight
do thou but close our hands with holy words then love devouring death do what he dare it is enough i may but call her mine
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume
the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite
therefore love moderately long love doth so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
o so light a foot will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint
a lover may bestride the gossamers that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall so light is vanity
good even to my ghostly confessor
romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
as much to him else is his thanks too much
ah juliet if the measure of thy joy be heap’d like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air and let rich music’s tongue unfold the imagin’d happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter
conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament
they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
come come with me and we will make short work for by your leaves you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one
enter mercutio benvolio page and servants
i pray thee good mercutio let’s retire the day is hot the capulets abroad and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says ‘god send me no need of thee ’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need
am i like such a fellow
come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved
nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other
why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes
what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling
thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter
with another for tying his new shoes with an old riband
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling
and i were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
by my head here comes the capulets
by my heel i care not
follow me close for i will speak to them
gentlemen good den a word with one of you
and but one word with one of us
couple it with something make it a word and a blow
you shall find me apt enough to that sir and you will give me occasion
could you not take some occasion without giving
what dost thou make us minstrels
and thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords
here’s my fiddlestick here’s that shall make you dance
we talk here in the public haunt of men
either withdraw unto some private place and reason coldly of your grievances or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze
i will not budge for no man’s pleasure i
well peace be with you sir here comes my man
but i’ll be hanged sir if he wear your livery
marry go before to field he’ll be your follower your worship in that sense may call him man
romeo the love i bear thee can afford no better term than this thou art a villain
tybalt the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting
villain am i none therefore farewell i see thou know’st me not
boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
i do protest i never injur’d thee but love thee better than thou canst devise till thou shalt know the reason of my love
and so good capulet which name i tender as dearly as mine own be satisfied
draws alla stoccata carries it away
tybalt you rat catcher will you walk
what wouldst thou have with me
good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives that i mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter dry beat the rest of the eight
will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears
make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out
gentle mercutio put thy rapier up
draw benvolio beat down their weapons
gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage tybalt mercutio the prince expressly hath forbid this bandying in verona streets
exeunt tybalt with his partizans mercutio
a plague o’ both your houses
is he gone and hath nothing
ay ay a scratch a scratch
courage man the hurt cannot be much
no ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but ’tis enough ’twill serve
ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
i am peppered i warrant for this world
a plague o’ both your houses
zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death
a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic —why the devil came you between us
i was hurt under your arm
i thought all for the best
help me into some house benvolio or i shall faint
a plague o’ both your houses
they have made worms’ meat of me
i have it and soundly too
this gentleman the prince’s near ally my very friend hath got his mortal hurt in my behalf my reputation stain’d with tybalt’s slander —tybalt that an hour hath been my cousin
o sweet juliet thy beauty hath made me effeminate and in my temper soften’d valour’s steel
o romeo romeo brave mercutio’s dead that gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds which too untimely here did scorn the earth
this day’s black fate on mo days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end
here comes the furious tybalt back again
again in triumph and mercutio slain
away to heaven respective lenity and fire ey’d fury be my conduct now
now tybalt take the ‘villain’ back again that late thou gav’st me for mercutio’s soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company
either thou or i or both must go with him
thou wretched boy that didst consort him here shalt with him hence
the citizens are up and tybalt slain
the prince will doom thee death if thou art taken
which way ran he that kill’d mercutio
tybalt that murderer which way ran he
i charge thee in the prince’s name obey
enter prince attended montague capulet their wives and others
where are the vile beginners of this fray
o noble prince i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
there lies the man slain by young romeo that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio
o the blood is spill’d of my dear kinsman
prince as thou art true for blood of ours shed blood of montague
benvolio who began this bloody fray
tybalt here slain whom romeo’s hand did slay romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urg’d withal your high displeasure
all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow’d could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio’s breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it
romeo he cries aloud ‘hold friends
friends part ’ and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and ’twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertain’d revenge and to’t they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
this is the truth or let benvolio die
he is a kinsman to the montague
affection makes him false he speaks not true
some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life
i beg for justice which thou prince must give romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live
romeo slew him he slew mercutio
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
not romeo prince he was mercutio’s friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt
and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence
i have an interest in your hate’s proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a bleeding
but i’ll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
let romeo hence in haste else when he is found that hour is his last
bear hence this body and attend our will
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
gallop apace you fiery footed steeds towards phoebus’ lodging
such a waggoner as phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately
spread thy close curtain love performing night that runaway’s eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms untalk’d of and unseen
lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties or if love be blind it best agrees with night
come civil night thou sober suited matron all in black and learn me how to lose a winning match play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
hood my unmann’d blood bating in my cheeks with thy black mantle till strange love grow bold think true love acted simple modesty
come night come romeo come thou day in night for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back
come gentle night come loving black brow’d night give me my romeo and when i shall die take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun
o i have bought the mansion of a love but not possess’d it and though i am sold not yet enjoy’d
so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them
o here comes my nurse and she brings news and every tongue that speaks but romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch
why dost thou wring thy hands
ah well a day he’s dead he’s dead he’s dead
we are undone lady we are undone
alack the day he’s gone he’s kill’d he’s dead
who ever would have thought it
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
this torture should be roar’d in dismal hell
say thou but ay and that bare vowel i shall poison more than the death darting eye of cockatrice
i am not i if there be such an i or those eyes shut that make thee answer ay
if he be slain say ay or if not no
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes god save the mark —here on his manly breast
a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse pale pale as ashes all bedaub’d in blood all in gore blood
to prison eyes ne’er look on liberty
vile earth to earth resign end motion here and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
that ever i should live to see thee dead
what storm is this that blows so contrary
is romeo slaughter’d and is tybalt dead
my dearest cousin and my dearer lord
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom for who is living if those two are gone
tybalt is gone and romeo banished romeo that kill’d him he is banished
did romeo’s hand shed tybalt’s blood
it did it did alas the day it did
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical dove feather’d raven wolvish ravening lamb
just opposite to what thou justly seem’st a damned saint an honourable villain
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound
o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace
there’s no trust no faith no honesty in men
all perjur’d all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
blister’d be thy tongue for such a wish
he was not born to shame
upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit for ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d sole monarch of the universal earth
o what a beast was i to chide at him
will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy three hours’ wife have mangled it
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
that villain cousin would have kill’d my husband
back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy
my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalt’s dead that would have slain my husband
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalt’s death that murder’d me
i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds
tybalt is dead and romeo banished
that ‘banished ’ that one word ‘banished ’ hath slain ten thousand tybalts
tybalt’s death was woe enough if it had ended there
or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rank’d with other griefs why follow’d not when she said tybalt’s dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentation might have mov’d
but with a rear ward following tybalt’s death ‘romeo is banished’—to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead
romeo is banished there is no end no limit measure bound in that word’s death no words can that woe sound
where is my father and my mother nurse
weeping and wailing over tybalt’s corse
wash they his wounds with tears
mine shall be spent when theirs are dry for romeo’s banishment
poor ropes you are beguil’d both you and i for romeo is exil’d
he made you for a highway to my bed but i a maid die maiden widowed
come cords come nurse i’ll to my wedding bed and death not romeo take my maidenhead
i’ll find romeo to comfort you
i wot well where he is
hark ye your romeo will be here at night
i’ll to him he is hid at lawrence’ cell
o find him give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell
romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand that i yet know not
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company
i bring thee tidings of the prince’s doom
what less than doomsday is the prince’s doom
a gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips not body’s death but body’s banishment
be merciful say death for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death
hence from verona art thou banished
be patient for the world is broad and wide
there is no world without verona walls but purgatory torture hell itself
hence banished is banish’d from the world and world’s exile is death
calling death banished thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince taking thy part hath brush’d aside the law and turn’d that black word death to banishment
this is dear mercy and thou see’st it not
heaven is here where juliet lives and every cat and dog and little mouse every unworthy thing live here in heaven and may look on her but romeo may not
more validity more honourable state more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo
they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliet’s hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips who even in pure and vestal modesty still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
but romeo may not he is banished
this may flies do when i from this must fly
they are free men but i am banished
and say’st thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mix’d no sharp ground knife no sudden mean of death though ne’er so mean but banished to kill me
o friar the damned use that word in hell
how hast thou the heart being a divine a ghostly confessor a sin absolver and my friend profess’d to mangle me with that word banished
thou fond mad man hear me speak a little romeo
o thou wilt speak again of banishment
i’ll give thee armour to keep off that word adversity’s sweet milk philosophy to comfort thee though thou art banished
unless philosophy can make a juliet displant a town reverse a prince’s doom it helps not it prevails not talk no more
o then i see that mad men have no ears
how should they when that wise men have no eyes
let me dispute with thee of thy estate
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
wert thou as young as i juliet thy love an hour but married tybalt murdered doting like me and like me banished then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair and fall upon the ground as i do now taking the measure of an unmade grave
not i unless the breath of heartsick groans mist like infold me from the search of eyes
hark how they knock —who’s there —romeo arise thou wilt be taken —stay awhile —stand up
knocking run to my study —by and by —god’s will what simpleness is this —i come i come
whence come you what’s your will
within let me come in and you shall know my errand
o holy friar o tell me holy friar where is my lady’s lord where’s romeo
there on the ground with his own tears made drunk
o he is even in my mistress’ case
even so lies she blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
stand up stand up stand and you be a man
for juliet’s sake for her sake rise and stand
why should you fall into so deep an o
ah sir ah sir death’s the end of all
doth not she think me an old murderer now i have stain’d the childhood of our joy with blood remov’d but little from her own
and what says my conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and now falls on her bed and then starts up and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries and then down falls again
as if that name shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name’s cursed hand murder’d her kinsman
o tell me friar tell me in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge
tell me that i may sack the hateful mansion
thy form cries out thou art
thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast
unseemly woman in a seeming man and ill beseeming beast in seeming both
by my holy order i thought thy disposition better temper’d
and slay thy lady that in thy life lives by doing damned hate upon thyself
why rail’st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou sham’st thy shape thy love thy wit which like a usurer abound’st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish thy wit that ornament to shape and love misshapen in the conduct of them both like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask is set afire by thine own ignorance and thou dismember’d with thine own defence
thy juliet is alive for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
tybalt would kill thee but thou slew’st tybalt there art thou happy
the law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile there art thou happy
a pack of blessings light upon thy back happiness courts thee in her best array but like a misshaped and sullen wench thou putt’st up thy fortune and thy love
take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou went’st forth in lamentation
commend me to thy lady and bid her hasten all the house to bed which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
o lord i could have stay’d here all the night to hear good counsel
my lord i’ll tell my lady you will come
do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
hie you make haste for it grows very late
how well my comfort is reviv’d by this
go hence good night and here stands all your state either be gone before the watch be set or by the break of day disguis’d from hence
i’ll find out your man and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here
give me thy hand ’tis late farewell good night
but that a joy past joy calls out on me it were a grief so brief to part with thee
enter capulet lady capulet and paris
things have fallen out sir so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter
look you she lov’d her kinsman tybalt dearly and so did i
well we were born to die
’tis very late she’ll not come down tonight
i promise you but for your company i would have been abed an hour ago
these times of woe afford no tune to woo
i will and know her mind early tomorrow tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness
sir paris i will make a desperate tender of my child’s love
i think she will be rul’d in all respects by me nay more i doubt it not
wife go you to her ere you go to bed acquaint her here of my son paris’ love and bid her mark you me on wednesday next but soft what day is this
well wednesday is too soon a thursday let it be a thursday tell her she shall be married to this noble earl
we’ll keep no great ado —a friend or two for hark you tybalt being slain so late it may be thought we held him carelessly being our kinsman if we revel much
therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends and there an end
but what say you to thursday
my lord i would that thursday were tomorrow
go you to juliet ere you go to bed prepare her wife against this wedding day
farewell my lord —light to my chamber ho
afore me it is so very very late that we may call it early by and by
exeunt scene v an open gallery to juliet’s chamber overlooking the garden
it is not yet near day
it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale
it was the lark the herald of the morn no nightingale
look love what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
night’s candles are burnt out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
i must be gone and live or stay and die
yond light is not daylight i know it i
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua
therefore stay yet thou need’st not to be gone
let me be ta’en let me be put to death i am content so thou wilt have it so
i’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye ’tis but the pale reflex of cynthia’s brow
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
i have more care to stay than will to go
it is the lark that sings so out of tune straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
o now i would they had chang’d voices too since arm from arm that voice doth us affray hunting thee hence with hunt’s up to the day
o now be gone more light and light it grows
more light and light more dark and dark our woes
your lady mother is coming to your chamber
the day is broke be wary look about
then window let day in and let life out
farewell farewell one kiss and i’ll descend
love lord ay husband friend i must hear from thee every day in the hour for in a minute there are many days
o by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings love to thee
o thinkest thou we shall ever meet again
i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come
i have an ill divining soul
methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb
either my eyesight fails or thou look’st pale
and trust me love in my eye so do you
all men call thee fickle if thou art fickle what dost thou with him that is renown’d for faith
be fickle fortune for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long but send him back
within ho daughter are you up
is she not down so late or up so early
what unaccustom’d cause procures her hither
evermore weeping for your cousin’s death
what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
and if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
therefore have done some grief shows much of love but much of grief shows still some want of wit
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
so shall you feel the loss but not the friend which you weep for
feeling so the loss i cannot choose but ever weep the friend
well girl thou weep’st not so much for his death as that the villain lives which slaughter’d him
villain and he be many miles asunder
i do with all my heart
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
that is because the traitor murderer lives
ay madam from the reach of these my hands
would none but i might venge my cousin’s death
we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
i’ll send to one in mantua where that same banish’d runagate doth live shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram that he shall soon keep tybalt company and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied
indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him—dead— is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d
madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet
o how my heart abhors to hear him nam’d and cannot come to him to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that hath slaughter’d him
find thou the means and i’ll find such a man
but now i’ll tell thee joyful tidings girl
and joy comes well in such a needy time
what are they i beseech your ladyship
well well thou hast a careful father child one who to put thee from thy heaviness hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects not nor i look’d not for
madam in happy time what day is that
marry my child early next thursday morn the gallant young and noble gentleman the county paris at saint peter’s church shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
now by saint peter’s church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride
i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo
i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris
here comes your father tell him so yourself and see how he will take it at your hands
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew but for the sunset of my brother’s son it rains downright
in one little body thou counterfeits a bark a sea a wind
for still thy eyes which i may call the sea do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs who raging with thy tears and they with them without a sudden calm will overset thy tempest tossed body
have you deliver’d to her our decree
ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
i would the fool were married to her grave
take me with you take me with you wife
doth she not give us thanks
doth she not count her blest unworthy as she is that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
not proud you have but thankful that you have
proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love
how now how now chopp’d logic
proud and i thank you and i thank you not and yet not proud
mistress minion you thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds but fettle your fine joints ’gainst thursday next to go with paris to saint peter’s church or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither
good father i beseech you on my knees hear me with patience but to speak a word
hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
i tell thee what —get thee to church a thursday or never after look me in the face
speak not reply not do not answer me
wife we scarce thought us blest that god had lent us but this only child but now i see this one is one too much and that we have a curse in having her
you are to blame my lord to rate her so
hold your tongue good prudence smatter with your gossips go
utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl for here we need it not
god’s bread it makes me mad
day night hour ride time work play alone in company still my care hath been to have her match’d and having now provided a gentleman of noble parentage of fair demesnes youthful and nobly allied stuff’d as they say with honourable parts proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man and then to have a wretched puling fool a whining mammet in her fortune’s tender to answer ‘i’ll not wed i cannot love i am too young i pray you pardon me ’ but and you will not wed i’ll pardon you
graze where you will you shall not house with me
look to’t think on’t i do not use to jest
thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
and you be mine i’ll give you to my friend and you be not hang beg starve die in the streets for by my soul i’ll ne’er acknowledge thee nor what is mine shall never do thee good
trust to’t bethink you i’ll not be forsworn
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief
o sweet my mother cast me not away delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies
talk not to me for i’ll not speak a word
do as thou wilt for i have done with thee
o nurse how shall this be prevented
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven
how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself
hast thou not a word of joy
romeo is banished and all the world to nothing that he dares ne’er come back to challenge you
or if he do it needs must be by stealth
then since the case so stands as now it doth i think it best you married with the county
an eagle madam hath not so green so quick so fair an eye as paris hath
beshrew my very heart i think you are happy in this second match for it excels your first or if it did not your first is dead or ’twere as good he were as living here and you no use of him
and from my soul too or else beshrew them both
well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeas’d my father to lawrence’ cell to make confession and to be absolv’d
marry i will and this is wisely done
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath prais’d him with above compare so many thousand times
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
i’ll to the friar to know his remedy
if all else fail myself have power to die
exit act iv scene i friar lawrence’s cell
my father capulet will have it so and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
you say you do not know the lady’s mind
uneven is the course i like it not
immoderately she weeps for tybalt’s death and therefore have i little talk’d of love for venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous that she do give her sorrow so much sway and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears which too much minded by herself alone may be put from her by society
now do you know the reason of this haste
aside i would i knew not why it should be slow’d — look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
happily met my lady and my wife
that may be sir when i may be a wife
that may be must be love on thursday next
come you to make confession to this father
to answer that i should confess to you
do not deny to him that you love me
i will confess to you that i love him
so will ye i am sure that you love me
if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face
poor soul thy face is much abus’d with tears
the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite
thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report
that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face
thy face is mine and thou hast slander’d it
it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now — my lord we must entreat the time alone
god shield i should disturb devotion — juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
o shut the door and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past cure past help
o juliet i already know thy grief it strains me past the compass of my wits
i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it on thursday next be married to this county
tell me not friar that thou hear’st of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife i’ll help it presently
god join’d my heart and romeo’s thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo’s seal’d shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both
therefore out of thy long experienc’d time give me some present counsel or behold ’twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the empire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring
be not so long to speak
i long to die if what thou speak’st speak not of remedy
i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame that cop’st with death himself to scape from it
and if thou dar’st i’ll give thee remedy
o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of yonder tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are
chain me with roaring bears or hide me nightly in a charnel house o’er cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
or bid me go into a new made grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love
go home be merry give consent to marry paris
wednesday is tomorrow tomorrow night look that thou lie alone let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilled liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes’ windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life
each part depriv’d of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
and in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncover’d on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the meantime against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it
o tell not me of fear
hold get you gone be strong and prosperous in this resolve
i’ll send a friar with speed to mantua with my letters to thy lord
love give me strength and strength shall help afford
enter capulet lady capulet nurse and servants
so many guests invite as here are writ
exit first servant sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks
you shall have none ill sir for i’ll try if they can lick their fingers
how canst thou try them so
marry sir ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me
exit second servant we shall be much unfurnish’d for this time
what is my daughter gone to friar lawrence
well he may chance to do some good on her
a peevish self will’d harlotry it is
see where she comes from shrift with merry look
where i have learnt me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoin’d by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon
henceforward i am ever rul’d by you
send for the county go tell him of this
i’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning
i met the youthful lord at lawrence’ cell and gave him what becomed love i might not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty
go i say and fetch him hither

nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow

i’ll not to bed tonight let me alone
i’ll play the housewife for this once —what ho — they are all forth well i will walk myself to county paris to prepare him up against tomorrow
my heart is wondrous light since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d
but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to myself tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou know’st is cross and full of sin
no madam we have cull’d such necessaries as are behoveful for our state tomorrow
so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business
get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
exeunt lady capulet and nurse juliet
god knows when we shall meet again
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life
i’ll call them back again to comfort me
nurse —what should she do here
my dismal scene i needs must act alone
what if this mixture do not work at all
shall i be married then tomorrow morning
laying down her dagger what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath minister’d to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d because he married me before to romeo
and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man
how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me
shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
o if i wake shall i not be distraught environed with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers’ joints
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
and in this rage with some great kinsman’s bone as with a club dash out my desperate brains
o look methinks i see my cousin’s ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapier’s point
throws herself on the bed scene iv
hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry
the second cock hath crow’d the curfew bell hath rung ’tis three o’clock
look to the bak’d meats good angelica spare not for cost
go you cot quean go get you to bed faith you’ll be sick tomorrow for this night’s watching
i have watch’d ere now all night for lesser cause and ne’er been sick
ay you have been a mouse hunt in your time but i will watch you from such watching now

exit first servant —sirrah fetch drier logs
call peter he will show thee where they are
i have a head sir that will find out logs and never trouble peter for the matter

the county will be here with music straight for so he said he would
go waken juliet go and trim her up
i’ll go and chat with paris
hie make haste make haste the bridegroom he is come already
exeunt scene v juliet’s chamber juliet on the bed
why lamb why lady fie you slug abed
sleep for a week for the next night i warrant the county paris hath set up his rest that you shall rest but little
ay let the county take you in your bed he’ll fright you up i’faith
what dress’d and in your clothes and down again
o well a day that ever i was born
revive look up or i will die with thee
for shame bring juliet forth her lord is come
she’s dead deceas’d she’s dead alack the day
alack the day she’s dead she’s dead she’s dead
she’s cold her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
life and these lips have long been separated
death lies on her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field
death that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
enter friar lawrence and paris with musicians
come is the bride ready to go to church
ready to go but never to return
o son the night before thy wedding day hath death lain with thy bride
there she lies flower as she was deflowered by him
death is my son in law death is my heir my daughter he hath wedded
and leave him all life living all is death’s
have i thought long to see this morning’s face and doth it give me such a sight as this
most miserable hour that e’er time saw in lasting labour of his pilgrimage
but one poor one one poor and loving child but one thing to rejoice and solace in and cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight
most lamentable day most woeful day that ever ever i did yet behold
o day o day o day o hateful day
never was seen so black a day as this
o woeful day o woeful day
most detestable death by thee beguil’d by cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
not life but love in death
uncomfortable time why cam’st thou now to murder murder our solemnity
my soul and not my child dead art thou
alack my child is dead and with my child my joys are buried
confusion’s cure lives not in these confusions
heaven and yourself had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all and all the better is it for the maid
your part in her you could not keep from death but heaven keeps his part in eternal life
the most you sought was her promotion for ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d and weep ye now seeing she is advanc’d above the clouds as high as heaven itself
o in this love you love your child so ill that you run mad seeing that she is well
she’s not well married that lives married long but she’s best married that dies married young
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse and as the custom is and in her best array bear her to church for though fond nature bids us all lament yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment
all things that we ordained festival turn from their office to black funeral our instruments to melancholy bells our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse and all things change them to the contrary
sir go you in and madam go with him and go sir paris everyone prepare to follow this fair corse unto her grave
the heavens do lower upon you for some ill move them no more by crossing their high will
exeunt capulet lady capulet paris and friar first musician
faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
honest good fellows ah put up put up for well you know this is a pitiful case
ay by my troth the case may be amended
musicians o musicians ‘heart’s ease ’ ‘heart’s ease’ o and you will have me live play ‘heart’s ease ’ first musician
o musicians because my heart itself plays ‘my heart is full’
o play me some merry dump to comfort me
not a dump we ’tis no time to play now
i will then give it you soundly
no money on my faith but the gleek
i will give you the minstrel
then will i give you the serving creature
then will i lay the serving creature’s dagger on your pate
i’ll re you i’ll fa you
and you re us and fa us you note us
pray you put up your dagger and put out your wit
then have at you with my wit
i will dry beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger
‘when griping griefs the heart doth wound and doleful dumps the mind oppress then music with her silver sound’— why ‘silver sound’
why ‘music with her silver sound’
marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
i say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver
faith i know not what to say
o i cry you mercy you are the singer
it is ‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for sounding
‘then music with her silver sound with speedy help doth lend redress ’ exit first musician
what a pestilent knave is this same
come we’ll in here tarry for the mourners and stay dinner
exeunt act v scene i mantua
if i may trust the flattering eye of sleep my dreams presage some joyful news at hand
my bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne and all this day an unaccustom’d spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead — strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think — and breath’d such life with kisses in my lips that i reviv’d and was an emperor
ah me how sweet is love itself possess’d when but love’s shadows are so rich in joy
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
that i ask again for nothing can be ill if she be well
then she is well and nothing can be ill
her body sleeps in capel’s monument and her immortal part with angels lives
i saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault and presently took post to tell it you
o pardon me for bringing these ill news since you did leave it for my office sir
get me ink and paper and hire post horses
i do beseech you sir have patience
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure
leave me and do the thing i bid thee do
hast thou no letters to me from the friar
get thee gone and hire those horses
exit balthasar well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
o mischief thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
i do remember an apothecary — and hereabouts he dwells —which late i noted in tatter’d weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meagre were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuff’d and other skins of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scatter’d to make up a show
noting this penury to myself i said and if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me
as i remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggar’s shop is shut
i see that thou art poor
let me have a dram of poison such soon speeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the life weary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath as violently as hasty powder fir’d doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb
such mortal drugs i have but mantua’s law is death to any he that utters them
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness and fear’st to die
famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thine eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
the world is not thy friend nor the world’s law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this
my poverty but not my will consents
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would despatch you straight
there is thy gold worse poison to men’s souls doing more murder in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
come cordial and not poison go with me to juliet’s grave for there must i use thee
this same should be the voice of friar john
or if his mind be writ give me his letter
going to find a barefoot brother out one of our order to associate me here in this city visiting the sick and finding him the searchers of the town suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign seal’d up the doors and would not let us forth so that my speed to mantua there was stay’d
who bare my letter then to romeo
i could not send it —here it is again — nor get a messenger to bring it thee so fearful were they of infection
by my brotherhood the letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import and the neglecting it may do much danger
friar john go hence get me an iron crow and bring it straight unto my cell
brother i’ll go and bring it thee
now must i to the monument alone
within this three hours will fair juliet wake
she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents but i will write again to mantua and keep her at my cell till romeo come
poor living corse clos’d in a dead man’s tomb
a churchyard in it a monument belonging to the capulets
enter paris and his page bearing flowers and a torch
yet put it out for i would not be seen
under yond yew tree lay thee all along holding thy ear close to the hollow ground so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread being loose unfirm with digging up of graves but thou shalt hear it
whistle then to me as signal that thou hear’st something approach
do as i bid thee go
aside i am almost afraid to stand alone here in the churchyard yet i will adventure
sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew
o woe thy canopy is dust and stones which with sweet water nightly i will dew or wanting that with tears distill’d by moans
the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
the page whistles the boy gives warning something doth approach
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight to cross my obsequies and true love’s rite
retires enter romeo and balthasar with a torch mattock c romeo
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
hold take this letter early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father
give me the light upon thy life i charge thee whate’er thou hear’st or seest stand all aloof and do not interrupt me in my course
why i descend into this bed of death is partly to behold my lady’s face but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring a ring that i must use in dear employment
but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
the time and my intents are savage wild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea
i will be gone sir and not trouble you
so shalt thou show me friendship
live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
for all this same i’ll hide me hereabout
his looks i fear and his intents i doubt
thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open breaking open the door of the monument and in despite i’ll cram thee with more food
this is that banish’d haughty montague that murder’d my love’s cousin —with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died — and here is come to do some villanous shame to the dead bodies
advances stop thy unhallow’d toil vile montague
can vengeance be pursu’d further than death
condemned villain i do apprehend thee
obey and go with me for thou must die
i must indeed and therefore came i hither
good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
think upon these gone let them affright thee
i beseech thee youth put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury
by heaven i love thee better than myself for i come hither arm’d against myself
stay not be gone live and hereafter say a madman’s mercy bid thee run away
i do defy thy conjuration and apprehend thee for a felon here
i will go call the watch
falls if thou be merciful open the tomb lay me with juliet
what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode
i think he told me paris should have married juliet
or did i dream it so
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so
o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortune’s book
i’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave
o no a lantern slaught’red youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light
death lie thou there by a dead man interr’d
laying paris in the monument how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry
which their keepers call a lightning before death
o how may i call this a lightning
o my love my wife death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
beauty’s ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and death’s pale flag is not advanced there
tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
o what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy
ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour
for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again
here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids
o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world wearied flesh
and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death
come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy sea sick weary bark
thus with a kiss i die
dies enter at the other end of the churchyard friar lawrence with a lantern crow and spade
how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves
who is it that consorts so late the dead
here’s one a friend and one that knows you well
tell me good my friend what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls
as i discern it burneth in the capels’ monument
it doth so holy sir and there’s my master one that you love
how long hath he been there
go with me to the vault
i dare not sir my master knows not but i am gone hence and fearfully did menace me with death if i did stay to look on his intents
o much i fear some ill unlucky thing
as i did sleep under this yew tree here i dreamt my master and another fought and that my master slew him
advances alack alack what blood is this which stains the stony entrance of this sepulchre
what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour’d by this place of peace
ah what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance
o comfortable friar where is my lord
i do remember well where i should be and there i am
lady come from that nest of death contagion and unnatural sleep
a greater power than we can contradict hath thwarted our intents
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead and paris too
come i’ll dispose of thee among a sisterhood of holy nuns
stay not to question for the watch is coming
go get thee hence for i will not away
a cup clos’d in my true love’s hand
poison i see hath been his timeless end
drink all and left no friendly drop to help me after
haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make me die with a restorative
kisses him thy lips are warm
snatching romeo’s dagger this is thy sheath
stabs herself there rest and let me die
falls on romeo’s body and dies enter watch with the page of paris
there where the torch doth burn
go some of you whoe’er you find attach
exeunt some of the watch pitiful sight
here lies the county slain and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead who here hath lain this two days buried
go tell the prince run to the capulets
raise up the montagues some others search
exeunt others of the watch we see the ground whereon these woes do lie but the true ground of all these piteous woes we cannot without circumstance descry
re enter some of the watch with balthasar
we found him in the churchyard
hold him in safety till the prince come hither
re enter others of the watch with friar lawrence
here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side
what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our morning’s rest
enter capulet lady capulet and others
what should it be that they so shriek abroad
o the people in the street cry romeo some juliet and some paris and all run with open outcry toward our monument
what fear is this which startles in our ears
sovereign here lies the county paris slain and romeo dead and juliet dead before warm and new kill’d
search seek and know how this foul murder comes
here is a friar and slaughter’d romeo’s man with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men’s tombs
o wife look how our daughter bleeds
this dagger hath mista’en for lo his house is empty on the back of montague and it mis sheathed in my daughter’s bosom
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre
come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down
alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath
what further woe conspires against mine age
what manners is in this to press before thy father to a grave
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death
meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion
i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder
and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excus’d
then say at once what thou dost know in this
i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeo’s faithful wife
i married them and their stol’n marriage day was tybalt’s doomsday whose untimely death banish’d the new made bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pin’d
you to remove that siege of grief from her betroth’d and would have married her perforce to county paris
then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some means to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death
meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrow’d grave being the time the potion’s force should cease
but he which bore my letter friar john was stay’d by accident and yesternight return’d my letter back
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred’s vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo
but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead
she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself
all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy
and if ought in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrific’d some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law
we still have known thee for a holy man
what can he say to this
i brought my master news of juliet’s death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father and threaten’d me with death going in the vault if i departed not and left him there
give me the letter i will look on it
where is the county’s page that rais’d the watch
sirrah what made your master in this place
he came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch
this letter doth make good the friar’s words their course of love the tidings of her death
and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor ’pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen
o brother montague give me thy hand
this is my daughter’s jointure for no more can i demand
but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that whiles verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet
as rich shall romeo’s by his lady’s lie poor sacrifices of our enmity
a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head
go hence to have more talk of these sad things
some shall be pardon’d and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo

sirs i will practise on this drunken man
what think you if he were convey’d to bed wrapp’d in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers a most delicious banquet by his bed and brave attendants near him when he wakes would not the beggar then forget himself
believe me lord i think he cannot choose
it would seem strange unto him when he wak’d
even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy
then take him up and manage well the jest
carry him gently to my fairest chamber and hang it round with all my wanton pictures balm his foul head in warm distilled waters and burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
persuade him that he hath been lunatic and when he says he is—say that he dreams for he is nothing but a mighty lord
this do and do it kindly gentle sirs it will be pastime passing excellent if it be husbanded with modesty
my lord i warrant you we will play our part as he shall think by our true diligence he is no less than what we say he is
take him up gently and to bed with him and each one to his office when he wakes

do you intend to stay with me tonight
so please your lordship to accept our duty
this fellow i remember since once he play’d a farmer’s eldest son ’twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well
i have forgot your name but sure that part was aptly fitted and naturally perform’d
i think ’twas soto that your honour means
’tis very true thou didst it excellent
well you are come to me in happy time the rather for i have some sport in hand wherein your cunning can assist me much
there is a lord will hear you play tonight but i am doubtful of your modesties lest over eying of his odd behaviour — for yet his honour never heard a play — you break into some merry passion and so offend him for i tell you sirs if you should smile he grows impatient
fear not my lord we can contain ourselves were he the veriest antick in the world
go sirrah take them to the buttery and give them friendly welcome everyone let them want nothing that my house affords
exit one with the players sirrah go you to barthol’mew my page and see him dress’d in all suits like a lady that done conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber and call him ‘madam ’ do him obeisance
and if the boy have not a woman’s gift to rain a shower of commanded tears an onion will do well for such a shift which in a napkin being close convey’d shall in despite enforce a watery eye
see this dispatch’d with all the haste thou canst anon i’ll give thee more instructions
exit servant i know the boy will well usurp the grace voice gait and action of a gentlewoman i long to hear him call the drunkard husband and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant
i’ll in to counsel them haply my presence may well abate the over merry spleen which otherwise would grow into extremes

i ne’er drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves give me conserves of beef
ne’er ask me what raiment i’ll wear for i have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay sometime more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the over leather

this it is that makes your lady mourn
this is it that makes your servants droop
hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house as beaten hence by your strange lunacy
o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment and banish hence these abject lowly dreams
look how thy servants do attend on thee each in his office ready at thy beck wilt thou have music
apollo plays music and twenty caged nightingales do sing or wilt thou sleep
we’ll have thee to a couch softer and sweeter than the lustful bed on purpose trimm’d up for semiramis
say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground or wilt thou ride
thy horses shall be trapp’d their harness studded all with gold and pearl
thou hast hawks will soar above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt
thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth
say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe
we will fetch thee straight adonis painted by a running brook and cytherea all in sedges hid which seem to move and wanton with her breath even as the waving sedges play with wind
we’ll show thee io as she was a maid and how she was beguiled and surpris’d as lively painted as the deed was done
or daphne roaming through a thorny wood scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds and at that sight shall sad apollo weep so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn
thou art a lord and nothing but a lord thou hast a lady far more beautiful than any woman in this waning age
and till the tears that she hath shed for thee like envious floods o’er run her lovely face she was the fairest creature in the world and yet she is inferior to none
and have i such a lady
or have i dream’d till now
i do not sleep i see i hear i speak i smell sweet savours and i feel soft things upon my life i am a lord indeed and not a tinker nor christophero sly
well bring our lady hither to our sight and once again a pot o’ the smallest ale
will’t please your mightiness to wash your hands
servants present a ewer basin and napkin o how we joy to see your wit restor’d
o that once more you knew but what you are
these fifteen years you have been in a dream or when you wak’d so wak’d as if you slept
by my fay a goodly nap
but did i never speak of all that time
yes my lord but very idle words for though you lay here in this goodly chamber yet would you say ye were beaten out of door and rail upon the hostess of the house and say you would present her at the leet because she brought stone jugs and no seal’d quarts
sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket
ay the woman’s maid of the house
why sir you know no house nor no such maid nor no such men as you have reckon’d up as stephen sly and old john naps of greece and peter turph and henry pimpernell and twenty more such names and men as these which never were nor no man ever saw
now lord be thanked for my good amends
enter the page as a lady with attendants
i thank thee thou shalt not lose by it
marry i fare well for here is cheer enough
here noble lord what is thy will with her
are you my wife and will not call me husband
my men should call me lord i am your goodman
my husband and my lord my lord and husband i am your wife in all obedience
madam and nothing else so lords call ladies
madam wife they say that i have dream’d and slept above some fifteen year or more
ay and the time seems thirty unto me being all this time abandon’d from your bed
servants leave me and her alone
madam undress you and come now to bed
thrice noble lord let me entreat of you to pardon me yet for a night or two or if not so until the sun be set for your physicians have expressly charg’d in peril to incur your former malady that i should yet absent me from your bed i hope this reason stands for my excuse
ay it stands so that i may hardly tarry so long but i would be loath to fall into my dreams again i will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood
your honour’s players hearing your amendment are come to play a pleasant comedy for so your doctors hold it very meet seeing too much sadness hath congeal’d your blood and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy therefore they thought it good you hear a play and frame your mind to mirth and merriment which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
marry i will let them play it
is not a commonty a christmas gambold or a tumbling trick
no my good lord it is more pleasing stuff
it is a kind of history
come madam wife sit by my side and let the world slip we shall ne’er be younger
tranio since for the great desire i had to see fair padua nursery of arts i am arriv’d for fruitful lombardy the pleasant garden of great italy and by my father’s love and leave am arm’d with his good will and thy good company my trusty servant well approv’d in all here let us breathe and haply institute a course of learning and ingenious studies
pisa renowned for grave citizens gave me my being and my father first a merchant of great traffic through the world vincentio come of the bentivolii
vincentio’s son brought up in florence it shall become to serve all hopes conceiv’d to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds and therefore tranio for the time i study virtue and that part of philosophy will i apply that treats of happiness by virtue specially to be achiev’d
tell me thy mind for i have pisa left and am to padua come as he that leaves a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
mi perdonato gentle master mine i am in all affected as yourself glad that you thus continue your resolve to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
only good master while we do admire this virtue and this moral discipline let’s be no stoics nor no stocks i pray or so devote to aristotle’s checks as ovid be an outcast quite abjur’d
balk logic with acquaintance that you have and practise rhetoric in your common talk music and poesy use to quicken you the mathematics and the metaphysics fall to them as you find your stomach serves you no profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en in brief sir study what you most affect
gramercies tranio well dost thou advise
if biondello thou wert come ashore we could at once put us in readiness and take a lodging fit to entertain such friends as time in padua shall beget
but stay awhile what company is this
master some show to welcome us to town
lucentio and tranio stand aside enter baptista katherina bianca gremio and hortensio
gentlemen importune me no farther for how i firmly am resolv’d you know that is not to bestow my youngest daughter before i have a husband for the elder
if either of you both love katherina because i know you well and love you well leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure
to cart her rather she’s too rough for me
there there hortensio will you any wife
to baptista i pray you sir is it your will to make a stale of me amongst these mates
no mates for you unless you were of gentler milder mould
i’ faith sir you shall never need to fear i wis it is not half way to her heart but if it were doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle with a three legg’d stool and paint your face and use you like a fool
from all such devils good lord deliver us
here’s some good pastime toward that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward
but in the other’s silence do i see maid’s mild behaviour and sobriety
gentlemen that i may soon make good what i have said —bianca get you in and let it not displease thee good bianca for i will love thee ne’er the less my girl
it is best put finger in the eye and she knew why
sister content you in my discontent
sir to your pleasure humbly i subscribe my books and instruments shall be my company on them to look and practise by myself
signior baptista will you be so strange
sorry am i that our good will effects bianca’s grief
why will you mew her up signior baptista for this fiend of hell and make her bear the penance of her tongue
gentlemen content ye i am resolv’d
exit bianca and for i know she taketh most delight in music instruments and poetry schoolmasters will i keep within my house fit to instruct her youth
if you hortensio or signior gremio you know any such prefer them hither for to cunning men i will be very kind and liberal to mine own children in good bringing up and so farewell
katherina you may stay for i have more to commune with bianca
why and i trust i may go too may i not
shall i be appointed hours as though belike i knew not what to take and what to leave
you may go to the devil’s dam your gifts are so good here’s none will hold you
their love is not so great hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out our cake’s dough on both sides
farewell yet for the love i bear my sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights i will wish him to her father
so will i signior gremio but a word i pray
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both —that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in bianca’s love —to labour and effect one thing specially
marry sir to get a husband for her sister
thinkest thou hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell
though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world and a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough
i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipp’d at the high cross every morning
faith as you say there’s small choice in rotten apples
but come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintained till by helping baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have to’t afresh
he that runs fastest gets the ring
i am agreed and would i had given him the best horse in padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her
i pray sir tell me is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold
till i found it to be true i never thought it possible or likely but see while idly i stood looking on i found the effect of love in idleness and now in plainness do confess to thee that art to me as secret and as dear as anna to the queen of carthage was tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio if i achieve not this young modest girl
counsel me tranio for i know thou canst assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
master it is no time to chide you now affection is not rated from the heart if love have touch’d you nought remains but so redime te captum quam queas minimo lucentio
gramercies lad go forward this contents the rest will comfort for thy counsel’s sound
master you look’d so longly on the maid
perhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all
o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face such as the daughter of agenor had that made great jove to humble him to her hand when with his knees he kiss’d the cretan strand
mark’d you not how her sister began to scold and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
tranio i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
nay then ’tis time to stir him from his trance
i pray awake sir if you love the maid bend thoughts and wits to achieve her
thus it stands her elder sister is so curst and shrewd that till the father rid his hands of her master your love must live a maid at home and therefore has he closely mew’d her up because she will not be annoy’d with suitors
ah tranio what a cruel father’s he
but art thou not advis’d he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
ay marry am i sir and now ’tis plotted
master for my hand both our inventions meet and jump in one
you will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid that’s your device
it is may it be done
not possible for who shall bear your part and be in padua here vincentio’s son keep house and ply his book welcome his friends visit his countrymen and banquet them
basta content thee for i have it full
we have not yet been seen in any house nor can we be distinguish’d by our faces for man or master then it follows thus thou shalt be master tranio in my stead keep house and port and servants as i should i will some other be some florentine some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa
’tis hatch’d and shall be so tranio at once uncase thee take my colour’d hat and cloak
when biondello comes he waits on thee but i will charm him first to keep his tongue
in brief sir sith it your pleasure is and i am tied to be obedient for so your father charg’d me at our parting ‘be serviceable to my son ’ quoth he although i think ’twas in another sense i am content to be lucentio because so well i love lucentio
tranio be so because lucentio loves and let me be a slave to achieve that maid whose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye
master has my fellow tranio stol’n your clothes
sirrah come hither ’tis no time to jest and therefore frame your manners to the time
your fellow tranio here to save my life puts my apparel and my count’nance on and i for my escape have put on his for in a quarrel since i came ashore i kill’d a man and fear i was descried
wait you on him i charge you as becomes while i make way from hence to save my life
and not a jot of tranio in your mouth tranio is changed to lucentio
the better for him would i were so too
so could i faith boy to have the next wish after that lucentio indeed had baptista’s youngest daughter
but sirrah not for my sake but your master’s i advise you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies when i am alone why then i am tranio but in all places else your master lucentio
one thing more rests that thyself execute to make one among these wooers if thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty
exeunt the presenters above speak first servant
my lord you nod you do not mind the play
yes by saint anne i do
a good matter surely comes there any more of it
’tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady would ’twere done
they sit and mark scene ii
enter petruchio and his man grumio
verona for a while i take my leave to see my friends in padua but of all my best beloved and approved friend hortensio and i trow this is his house
here sirrah grumio knock i say
is there any man has rebused your worship
villain i say knock me here soundly
why sir what am i sir that i should knock you here sir
villain i say knock me at this gate and rap me well or i’ll knock your knave’s pate
i should knock you first and then i know after who comes by the worst
faith sirrah and you’ll not knock i’ll ring it i’ll try how you can sol fa and sing it
he wrings grumio by the ears grumio
now knock when i bid you sirrah villain
how do you all at verona
signior hortensio come you to part the fray
con tutto il cuore ben trovato may i say
alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor mio petruchio rise grumio rise we will compound this quarrel
nay ’tis no matter sir what he ’leges in latin
if this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught i see two and thirty a pip out
whom would to god i had well knock’d at first then had not grumio come by the worst
good hortensio i bade the rascal knock upon your gate and could not get him for my heart to do it
spake you not these words plain ‘sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly’
and come you now with ‘knocking at the gate’
sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
petruchio patience i am grumio’s pledge why this’s a heavy chance ’twixt him and you your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale blows you to padua here from old verona
such wind as scatters young men through the world to seek their fortunes farther than at home where small experience grows
but in a few signior hortensio thus it stands with me antonio my father is deceas’d and i have thrust myself into this maze haply to wive and thrive as best i may crowns in my purse i have and goods at home and so am come abroad to see the world
petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee and wish thee to a shrewd ill favour’d wife
thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel and yet i’ll promise thee she shall be rich and very rich but th’art too much my friend and i’ll not wish thee to her
signior hortensio ’twixt such friends as we few words suffice and therefore if thou know one rich enough to be petruchio’s wife as wealth is burden of my wooing dance be she as foul as was florentius’ love as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd as socrates’ xanthippe or a worse she moves me not or not removes at least affection’s edge in me were she as rough as are the swelling adriatic seas i come to wive it wealthily in padua if wealthily then happily in padua
nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet baby or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal
petruchio since we are stepp’d thus far in i will continue that i broach’d in jest
i can petruchio help thee to a wife with wealth enough and young and beauteous brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman her only fault —and that is faults enough — is that she is intolerable curst and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure that were my state far worser than it is i would not wed her for a mine of gold
thou know’st not gold’s effect tell me her father’s name and ’tis enough for i will board her though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
her father is baptista minola an affable and courteous gentleman her name is katherina minola renown’d in padua for her scolding tongue
i know her father though i know not her and he knew my deceased father well
i will not sleep hortensio till i see her and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter unless you will accompany me thither
i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
o’ my word and she knew him as well as i do she would think scolding would do little good upon him
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so why that’s nothing and he begin once he’ll rail in his rope tricks
i’ll tell you what sir and she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
tarry petruchio i must go with thee for in baptista’s keep my treasure is he hath the jewel of my life in hold his youngest daughter beautiful bianca and her withholds from me and other more suitors to her and rivals in my love supposing it a thing impossible for those defects i have before rehears’d that ever katherina will be woo’d therefore this order hath baptista ta’en that none shall have access unto bianca till katherine the curst have got a husband
a title for a maid of all titles the worst
now shall my friend petruchio do me grace and offer me disguis’d in sober robes to old baptista as a schoolmaster well seen in music to instruct bianca that so i may by this device at least have leave and leisure to make love to her and unsuspected court her by herself
see to beguile the old folks how the young folks lay their heads together
enter gremio and lucentio disguised with books under his arm
master master look about you who goes there ha
it is the rival of my love
a proper stripling and an amorous
very well i have perus’d the note
hark you sir i’ll have them very fairly bound all books of love see that at any hand and see you read no other lectures to her
over and beside signior baptista’s liberality i’ll mend it with a largess
take your papers too and let me have them very well perfum’d for she is sweeter than perfume itself to whom they go to
what will you read to her
whate’er i read to her i’ll plead for you as for my patron stand you so assur’d as firmly as yourself were still in place yea and perhaps with more successful words than you unless you were a scholar sir
this learning what a thing it is
this woodcock what an ass it is
and you are well met signior hortensio
trow you whither i am going
i promis’d to enquire carefully about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca and by good fortune i have lighted well on this young man for learning and behaviour fit for her turn well read in poetry and other books good ones i warrant ye
’tis well and i have met a gentleman hath promis’d me to help me to another a fine musician to instruct our mistress so shall i no whit be behind in duty to fair bianca so belov’d of me
belov’d of me and that my deeds shall prove
aside and that his bags shall prove
gremio ’tis now no time to vent our love listen to me and if you speak me fair i’ll tell you news indifferent good for either
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met upon agreement from us to his liking will undertake to woo curst katherine yea and to marry her if her dowry please
so said so done is well
hortensio have you told him all her faults
i know she is an irksome brawling scold if that be all masters i hear no harm
born in verona old antonio’s son
my father dead my fortune lives for me and i do hope good days and long to see
o sir such a life with such a wife were strange
but if you have a stomach to’t a god’s name you shall have me assisting you in all
but will you woo this wild cat
why came i hither but to that intent
think you a little din can daunt mine ears
have i not in my time heard lions roar
have i not heard the sea puff’d up with winds rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
have i not heard great ordnance in the field and heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies
have i not in a pitched battle heard loud ’larums neighing steeds and trumpets’ clang
and do you tell me of a woman’s tongue that gives not half so great a blow to hear as will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire
hortensio hark this gentleman is happily arriv’d my mind presumes for his own good and yours
i promis’d we would be contributors and bear his charge of wooing whatsoe’er
and so we will provided that he win her
i would i were as sure of a good dinner
if i may be bold tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way to the house of signior baptista minola
he that has the two fair daughters is’t he you mean
hark you sir you mean not her to— tranio
perhaps him and her sir what have you to do
not her that chides sir at any hand i pray
sir a word ere you go
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
and if i be sir is it any offence
no if without more words you will get you hence
why sir i pray are not the streets as free for me as for you
for what reason i beseech you
for this reason if you’ll know that she’s the choice love of signior gremio
that she’s the chosen of signior hortensio
if you be gentlemen do me this right hear me with patience
baptista is a noble gentleman to whom my father is not all unknown and were his daughter fairer than she is she may more suitors have and me for one
fair leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers then well one more may fair bianca have and so she shall lucentio shall make one though paris came in hope to speed alone
what this gentleman will out talk us all
sir give him head i know he’ll prove a jade
hortensio to what end are all these words
sir let me be so bold as ask you did you yet ever see baptista’s daughter
no sir but hear i do that he hath two the one as famous for a scolding tongue as is the other for beauteous modesty
sir sir the first’s for me let her go by
yea leave that labour to great hercules and let it be more than alcides’ twelve
sir understand you this of me in sooth the youngest daughter whom you hearken for her father keeps from all access of suitors and will not promise her to any man until the elder sister first be wed the younger then is free and not before
if it be so sir that you are the man must stead us all and me amongst the rest and if you break the ice and do this feat achieve the elder set the younger free for our access whose hap shall be to have her will not so graceless be to be ingrate
sir you say well and well you do conceive and since you do profess to be a suitor you must as we do gratify this gentleman to whom we all rest generally beholding
sir i shall not be slack in sign whereof please ye we may contrive this afternoon and quaff carouses to our mistress’ health and do as adversaries do in law strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
the motion’s good indeed and be it so — petruchio i shall be your ben venuto
exeunt act ii scene i padua
good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself to make a bondmaid and a slave of me that i disdain but for these other gawds unbind my hands i’ll pull them off myself yea all my raiment to my petticoat or what you will command me will i do so well i know my duty to my elders
of all thy suitors here i charge thee tell whom thou lov’st best see thou dissemble not
believe me sister of all the men alive i never yet beheld that special face which i could fancy more than any other
if you affect him sister here i swear i’ll plead for you myself but you shall have him
then belike you fancy riches more you will have gremio to keep you fair
is it for him you do envy me so
nay then you jest and now i well perceive you have but jested with me all this while i prithee sister kate untie my hands
if that be jest then all the rest was so
go ply thy needle meddle not with her
for shame thou hilding of a devilish spirit why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee
when did she cross thee with a bitter word
her silence flouts me and i’ll be reveng’d
nay now i see she is your treasure she must have a husband i must dance bare foot on her wedding day and for your love to her lead apes in hell
talk not to me i will go sit and weep till i can find occasion of revenge
was ever gentleman thus griev’d as i
enter gremio with lucentio in the habit of a mean man petruchio with hortensio as a musician and tranio with biondello bearing a lute and books
pray have you not a daughter call’d katherina fair and virtuous
i have a daughter sir call’d katherina
you are too blunt go to it orderly
you wrong me signior gremio give me leave
i am a gentleman of verona sir that hearing of her beauty and her wit her affability and bashful modesty her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour am bold to show myself a forward guest within your house to make mine eye the witness of that report which i so oft have heard
and for an entrance to my entertainment i do present you with a man of mine presenting hortensio cunning in music and the mathematics to instruct her fully in those sciences whereof i know she is not ignorant
accept of him or else you do me wrong his name is licio born in mantua
y’are welcome sir and he for your good sake but for my daughter katherine this i know she is not for your turn the more my grief
i see you do not mean to part with her or else you like not of my company
mistake me not i speak but as i find
what may i call your name
petruchio is my name antonio’s son a man well known throughout all italy
i know him well you are welcome for his sake
saving your tale petruchio i pray let us that are poor petitioners speak too
o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing
i doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing
neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am sure of it
to express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar presenting lucentio that has been long studying at rheims as cunning in greek latin and other languages as the other in music and mathematics
his name is cambio pray accept his service
a thousand thanks signior gremio welcome good cambio
to tranio but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger
may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming
pardon me sir the boldness is mine own that being a stranger in this city here do make myself a suitor to your daughter unto bianca fair and virtuous
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me in the preferment of the eldest sister
this liberty is all that i request that upon knowledge of my parentage i may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo and free access and favour as the rest and toward the education of your daughters i here bestow a simple instrument and this small packet of greek and latin books if you accept them then their worth is great
lucentio is your name of whence i pray
of pisa sir son to vincentio
a mighty man of pisa by report i know him well you are very welcome sir
take you the lute to lucentio
and you the set of books you shall go see your pupils presently
sirrah lead these gentlemen to my daughters and tell them both these are their tutors bid them use them well
exeunt servant with hortensio lucentio and biondello we will go walk a little in the orchard and then to dinner
you are passing welcome and so i pray you all to think yourselves
signior baptista my business asketh haste and every day i cannot come to woo
you knew my father well and in him me left solely heir to all his lands and goods which i have bettered rather than decreas’d then tell me if i get your daughter’s love what dowry shall i have with her to wife
after my death the one half of my lands and in possession twenty thousand crowns
and for that dowry i’ll assure her of her widowhood be it that she survive me in all my lands and leases whatsoever
let specialities be therefore drawn between us that covenants may be kept on either hand
ay when the special thing is well obtain’d that is her love for that is all in all
why that is nothing for i tell you father i am as peremptory as she proud minded and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all so i to her and so she yields to me for i am rough and woo not like a babe
well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
but be thou arm’d for some unhappy words
ay to the proof as mountains are for winds that shake not though they blow perpetually
re enter hortensio with his head broke
why dost thou look so pale
for fear i promise you if i look pale
what will my daughter prove a good musician
i think she’ll sooner prove a soldier iron may hold with her but never lutes
why then thou canst not break her to the lute
why no for she hath broke the lute to me
i did but tell her she mistook her frets and bow’d her hand to teach her fingering when with a most impatient devilish spirit ’frets call you these ’ quoth she ‘i’ll fume with them’ and with that word she struck me on the head and through the instrument my pate made way and there i stood amazed for a while as on a pillory looking through the lute while she did call me rascal fiddler and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms as had she studied to misuse me so
now by the world it is a lusty wench
i love her ten times more than e’er i did o
how i long to have some chat with her
well go with me and be not so discomfited proceed in practice with my younger daughter she’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns
signior petruchio will you go with us or shall i send my daughter kate to you
exeunt baptista gremio tranio and hortensio i will attend her here and woo her with some spirit when she comes
say that she rail why then i’ll tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale say that she frown i’ll say she looks as clear as morning roses newly wash’d with dew say she be mute and will not speak a word then i’ll commend her volubility and say she uttereth piercing eloquence if she do bid me pack i’ll give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week if she deny to wed i’ll crave the day when i shall ask the banns and when be married
but here she comes and now petruchio speak
good morrow kate for that’s your name i hear
well have you heard but something hard of hearing they call me katherine that do talk of me
you lie in faith for you are call’d plain kate and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst but kate the prettiest kate in christendom kate of kate hall my super dainty kate for dainties are all kates and therefore kate take this of me kate of my consolation hearing thy mildness prais’d in every town thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded — yet not so deeply as to thee belongs — myself am mov’d to woo thee for my wife
in good time let him that mov’d you hither remove you hence
i knew you at the first you were a moveable
thou hast hit it come sit on me
asses are made to bear and so are you
women are made to bear and so are you
no such jade as bear you if me you mean
good kate i will not burden thee for knowing thee to be but young and light — katherina
too light for such a swain as you to catch and yet as heavy as my weight should be
well ta’en and like a buzzard
ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
come come you wasp i’ faith you are too angry
if i be waspish best beware my sting
my remedy is then to pluck it out
ay if the fool could find it where it lies
who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting
yours if you talk of tales and so farewell
with my tongue in your tail
nay come again good kate i am a gentleman
i swear i’ll cuff you if you strike again
so may you lose your arms if you strike me you are no gentleman and if no gentleman why then no arms
a combless cock so kate will be my hen
no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
nay come kate come you must not look so sour
it is my fashion when i see a crab
why here’s no crab and therefore look not sour
had i a glass i would
well aim’d of such a young one
now by saint george i am too young for you
nay hear you kate in sooth you ’scape not so
i chafe you if i tarry let me go
no not a whit i find you passing gentle
’twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen and now i find report a very liar for thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous but slow in speech yet sweet as spring time flowers
thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance nor bite the lip as angry wenches will nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk but thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers with gentle conference soft and affable
why does the world report that kate doth limp
kate like the hazel twig is straight and slender and as brown in hue as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
let me see thee walk thou dost not halt
go fool and whom thou keep’st command
did ever dian so become a grove as kate this chamber with her princely gait
be thou dian and let her be kate and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful
where did you study all this goodly speech
it is extempore from my mother wit
marry so i mean sweet katherine in thy bed and therefore setting all this chat aside thus in plain terms your father hath consented that you shall be my wife your dowry ’greed on and will you nill you i will marry you
now kate i am a husband for your turn for by this light whereby i see thy beauty — thy beauty that doth make me like thee well — thou must be married to no man but me for i am he am born to tame you kate and bring you from a wild kate to a kate conformable as other household kates
re enter baptista gremio and tranio
never make denial i must and will have katherine to my wife
now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter
it were impossible i should speed amiss
why how now daughter katherine in your dumps
now i promise you you have show’d a tender fatherly regard to wish me wed to one half lunatic a mad cap ruffian and a swearing jack that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
father ’tis thus yourself and all the world that talk’d of her have talk’d amiss of her if she be curst it is for policy for she’s not froward but modest as the dove she is not hot but temperate as the morn for patience she will prove a second grissel and roman lucrece for her chastity and to conclude we have ’greed so well together that upon sunday is the wedding day
i’ll see thee hang’d on sunday first
hark petruchio she says she’ll see thee hang’d first
nay then good night our part
i choose her for myself if she and i be pleas’d what’s that to you
’tis bargain’d ’twixt us twain being alone that she shall still be curst in company
i tell you ’tis incredible to believe how much she loves me o
the kindest kate she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss she vied so fast protesting oath on oath that in a twink she won me to her love
you are novices ’tis a world to see how tame when men and women are alone a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
give me thy hand kate i will unto venice to buy apparel ’gainst the wedding day
provide the feast father and bid the guests i will be sure my katherine shall be fine
i know not what to say but give me your hands
amen say we we will be witnesses
father and wife and gentlemen adieu
i will to venice sunday comes apace we will have rings and things and fine array and kiss me kate we will be married o’ sunday
exeunt petruchio and katherina severally gremio
was ever match clapp’d up so suddenly
faith gentlemen now i play a merchant’s part and venture madly on a desperate mart
’twas a commodity lay fretting by you ’twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
the gain i seek is quiet in the match
no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
but now baptista to your younger daughter now is the day we long have looked for i am your neighbour and was suitor first
and i am one that love bianca more than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
youngling thou canst not love so dear as i tranio
skipper stand back ’tis age that nourisheth
but youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth
content you gentlemen i’ll compound this strife ’tis deeds must win the prize and he of both that can assure my daughter greatest dower shall have my bianca’s love
say signior gremio what can you assure her
myself am struck in years i must confess and if i die tomorrow this is hers if whilst i live she will be only mine
sir list to me i am my father’s heir and only son if i may have your daughter to my wife i’ll leave her houses three or four as good within rich pisa’s walls as anyone old signior gremio has in padua besides two thousand ducats by the year of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
what have i pinch’d you signior gremio
two thousand ducats by the year of land
my land amounts not to so much in all that she shall have besides an argosy that now is lying in marseilles’ road
what have i chok’d you with an argosy
gremio ’tis known my father hath no less than three great argosies besides two galliasses and twelve tight galleys these i will assure her and twice as much whate’er thou offer’st next
nay i have offer’d all i have no more and she can have no more than all i have if you like me she shall have me and mine
why then the maid is mine from all the world by your firm promise gremio is out vied
i must confess your offer is the best and let your father make her the assurance she is your own else you must pardon me if you should die before him where’s her dower
that’s but a cavil he is old i young
and may not young men die as well as old
well gentlemen i am thus resolv’d
on sunday next you know my daughter katherine is to be married now on the sunday following shall bianca be bride to you if you make this assurance if not to signior gremio
and so i take my leave and thank you both
exit baptista now i fear thee not sirrah young gamester your father were a fool to give thee all and in his waning age set foot under thy table
an old italian fox is not so kind my boy
a vengeance on your crafty wither’d hide
yet i have fac’d it with a card of ten
’tis in my head to do my master good i see no reason but suppos’d lucentio must get a father call’d suppos’d vincentio and that’s a wonder fathers commonly do get their children but in this case of wooing a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning
exit act iii scene i padua
fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir
have you so soon forgot the entertainment her sister katherine welcome’d you withal
but wrangling pedant this is the patroness of heavenly harmony then give me leave to have prerogative and when in music we have spent an hour your lecture shall have leisure for as much
preposterous ass that never read so far to know the cause why music was ordain’d
was it not to refresh the mind of man after his studies or his usual pain
then give me leave to read philosophy and while i pause serve in your harmony
sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine
why gentlemen you do me double wrong to strive for that which resteth in my choice
i am no breeching scholar in the schools i’ll not be tied to hours nor ’pointed times but learn my lessons as i please myself
and to cut off all strife here sit we down take you your instrument play you the whiles his lecture will be done ere you have tun’d
you’ll leave his lecture when i am in tune
that will be never tune your instrument
here madam — hic ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus hic steterat priami regia celsa senis bianca
hic ibat as i told you before simois i am lucentio hic est son unto vincentio of pisa sigeia tellus disguised thus to get your love hic steterat and that lucentio that comes a wooing priami is my man tranio regia bearing my port celsa senis that we might beguile the old pantaloon
returning madam my instrument’s in tune
let’s hear — hortensio plays o fie
spit in the hole man and tune again
now let me see if i can construe it hic ibat simois i know you not hic est sigeia tellus i trust you not hic steterat priami take heed he hear us not regia presume not celsa senis despair not
the base is right ’tis the base knave that jars
aside how fiery and forward our pedant is
now for my life the knave doth court my love pedascule i’ll watch you better yet
in time i may believe yet i mistrust
mistrust it not for sure æacides was ajax call’d so from his grandfather
i must believe my master else i promise you i should be arguing still upon that doubt but let it rest
good master take it not unkindly pray that i have been thus pleasant with you both
to lucentio you may go walk and give me leave a while my lessons make no music in three parts
well i must wait aside and watch withal for but i be deceiv’d our fine musician groweth amorous
madam before you touch the instrument to learn the order of my fingering i must begin with rudiments of art to teach you gamut in a briefer sort more pleasant pithy and effectual than hath been taught by any of my trade and there it is in writing fairly drawn
why i am past my gamut long ago
yet read the gamut of hortensio
gamut i am the ground of all accord a re to plead hortensio’s passion b mi bianca take him for thy lord c fa ut that loves with all affection d sol re one clef two notes have i e la mi show pity or i die
tut i like it not old fashions please me best i am not so nice to change true rules for odd inventions
mistress your father prays you leave your books and help to dress your sister’s chamber up you know tomorrow is the wedding day
farewell sweet masters both i must be gone
faith mistress then i have no cause to stay
but i have cause to pry into this pedant methinks he looks as though he were in love
yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble to cast thy wand’ring eyes on every stale seize thee that list if once i find thee ranging hortensio will be quit with thee by changing
enter baptista gremio tranio katherina bianca lucentio and attendants
signior lucentio this is the ’pointed day that katherine and petruchio should be married and yet we hear not of our son in law
what mockery will it be to want the bridegroom when the priest attends to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
what says lucentio to this shame of ours
no shame but mine i must forsooth be forc’d to give my hand oppos’d against my heart unto a mad brain rudesby full of spleen who woo’d in haste and means to wed at leisure
i told you i he was a frantic fool hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour and to be noted for a merry man he’ll woo a thousand ’point the day of marriage make friends invite and proclaim the banns yet never means to wed where he hath woo’d
now must the world point at poor katherine and say ‘lo
there is mad petruchio’s wife if it would please him come and marry her ’ tranio
patience good katherine and baptista too
upon my life petruchio means but well whatever fortune stays him from his word though he be blunt i know him passing wise though he be merry yet withal he’s honest
would katherine had never seen him though
exit weeping followed by bianca and others baptista
go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep for such an injury would vex a very saint much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
old news and such news as you never heard of
is it new and old too
why is it not news to hear of petruchio’s coming
when he stands where i am and sees you there
but say what to thine old news
his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies prick’d in’t for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey
’tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion yet oftentimes he goes but mean apparell’d
i am glad he’s come howsoe’er he comes
didst thou not say he comes
no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back
nay by saint jamy i hold you a penny a horse and a man is more than one and yet not many
and yet i come not well
not so well apparell’d as i wish you were
were it better i should rush in thus
gentles methinks you frown and wherefore gaze this goodly company as if they saw some wondrous monument some comet or unusual prodigy
why sir you know this is your wedding day first were we sad fearing you would not come now sadder that you come so unprovided
doff this habit shame to your estate an eye sore to our solemn festival
and tell us what occasion of import hath all so long detain’d you from your wife and sent you hither so unlike yourself
tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear sufficeth i am come to keep my word though in some part enforced to digress which at more leisure i will so excuse as you shall well be satisfied withal
i stay too long from her the morning wears ’tis time we were at church
see not your bride in these unreverent robes go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
not i believe me thus i’ll visit her
but thus i trust you will not marry her
good sooth even thus therefore ha’ done with words to me she’s married not unto my clothes
could i repair what she will wear in me as i can change these poor accoutrements ’twere well for kate and better for myself
but what a fool am i to chat with you when i should bid good morrow to my bride and seal the title with a lovely kiss
exeunt petruchio grumio and biondello tranio
he hath some meaning in his mad attire
we will persuade him be it possible to put on better ere he go to church
i’ll after him and see the event of this
exeunt baptista gremio and attendants tranio
but sir to love concerneth us to add her father’s liking which to bring to pass as i before imparted to your worship i am to get a man —whate’er he be it skills not much we’ll fit him to our turn — and he shall be vincentio of pisa and make assurance here in padua of greater sums than i have promised
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope and marry sweet bianca with consent
were it not that my fellow schoolmaster doth watch bianca’s steps so narrowly ’twere good methinks to steal our marriage which once perform’d let all the world say no i’ll keep mine own despite of all the world
that by degrees we mean to look into and watch our vantage in this business
we’ll over reach the greybeard gremio the narrow prying father minola the quaint musician amorous licio all for my master’s sake lucentio
signior gremio came you from the church
as willingly as e’er i came from school
and is the bride and bridegroom coming home
’tis a groom indeed a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
why he’s a devil a devil a very fiend
why she’s a devil a devil the devil’s dam
she’s a lamb a dove a fool to him
i’ll tell you sir lucentio when the priest should ask if katherine should be his wife ’ay by gogs wouns’ quoth he and swore so loud that all amaz’d the priest let fall the book and as he stoop’d again to take it up the mad brain’d bridegroom took him such a cuff that down fell priest and book and book and priest ‘now take them up ’ quoth he ‘if any list ’ tranio
what said the wench when he rose again
trembled and shook for why he stamp’d and swore as if the vicar meant to cozen him
but after many ceremonies done he calls for wine ‘a health ’ quoth he as if he had been abroad carousing to his mates after a storm quaff’d off the muscadel and threw the sops all in the sexton’s face having no other reason but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seem’d to ask him sops as he was drinking
this done he took the bride about the neck and kiss’d her lips with such a clamorous smack that at the parting all the church did echo
and i seeing this came thence for very shame and after me i know the rout is coming
such a mad marriage never was before

a hall in petruchio’s country house
fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all foul ways
i am sent before to make a fire and they are coming after to warm them
now were not i a little pot and soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my belly ere i should come by a fire to thaw me
but i with blowing the fire shall warm myself for considering the weather a taller man than i will take cold
who is that calls so coldly
a piece of ice if thou doubt it thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck
is my master and his wife coming grumio
curtis ay and therefore fire fire cast on no water
is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported
she was good curtis before this frost but thou knowest winter tames man woman and beast for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself fellow curtis
why thy horn is a foot and so long am i at the least
but wilt thou make a fire or shall i complain on thee to our mistress whose hand —she being now at hand — thou shalt soon feel to thy cold comfort for being slow in thy hot office
i prithee good grumio tell me how goes the world
a cold world curtis in every office but thine and therefore fire
do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death
there’s fire ready and therefore good grumio the news
ho boy ’ and as much news as wilt thou
come you are so full of cony catching
why therefore fire for i have caught extreme cold
is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the servingmen in their new fustian their white stockings and every officer his wedding garment on
be the jacks fair within the jills fair without and carpets laid and everything in order
all ready and therefore i pray thee news
first know my horse is tired my master and mistress fallen out
out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale
this ’tis to feel a tale not to hear a tale
and therefore ’tis called a sensible tale and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech listening
now i begin imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress — curtis
by this reckoning he is more shrew than she
ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home
but what talk i of this
call forth nathaniel joseph nicholas philip walter sugarsop and the rest let their heads be sleekly combed their blue coats brush’d and their garters of an indifferent knit let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse tail till they kiss their hands
you must meet my master to countenance my mistress
why she hath a face of her own
thou it seems that calls for company to countenance her
i call them forth to credit her
why she comes to borrow nothing of them
welcome you how now you what you fellow you and thus much for greeting
now my spruce companions is all ready and all things neat
e’en at hand alighted by this and therefore be not — cock’s passion silence
no man at door to hold my stirrup nor to take my horse
where is nathaniel gregory philip — all servants
you logger headed and unpolish’d grooms
where is the foolish knave i sent before
here sir as foolish as i was before
did i not bid thee meet me in the park and bring along these rascal knaves with thee
nathaniel’s coat sir was not fully made and gabriel’s pumps were all unpink’d i’ the heel there was no link to colour peter’s hat and walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing there was none fine but adam ralph and gregory the rest were ragged old and beggarly yet as they are here are they come to meet you
go rascals go and fetch my supper in
exeunt some of the servants where is the life that late i led
why when i say —nay good sweet kate be merry — off with my boots you rogues
it was the friar of orders grey as he forth walked on his way out you rogue
you pluck my foot awry strikes him take that and mend the plucking off the other
sirrah get you hence and bid my cousin ferdinand come hither exit servant one kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with
come kate and wash and welcome heartily — servant lets the ewer fall
petruchio strikes him you whoreson villain
patience i pray you ’twas a fault unwilling
a whoreson beetle headed flap ear’d knave
come kate sit down i know you have a stomach
will you give thanks sweet kate or else shall i — what’s this
’tis burnt and so is all the meat
how durst you villains bring it from the dresser and serve it thus to me that love it not
throws the meat etc at them there take it to you trenchers cups and all
you heedless joltheads and unmanner’d slaves
i pray you husband be not so disquiet the meat was well if you were so contented
i tell thee kate ’twas burnt and dried away and i expressly am forbid to touch it for it engenders choler planteth anger and better ’twere that both of us did fast since of ourselves ourselves are choleric than feed it with such over roasted flesh
be patient tomorrow ’t shall be mended
and for this night we’ll fast for company come i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber
exeunt petruchio katherina and curtis nathaniel
peter didst ever see the like
he kills her in her own humour
in her chamber making a sermon of continency to her and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul knows not which way to stand to look to speak and sits as one new risen from a dream
thus have i politicly begun my reign and ’tis my hope to end successfully
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be full gorg’d for then she never looks upon her lure
another way i have to man my haggard to make her come and know her keeper’s call that is to watch her as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient
she eat no meat today nor none shall eat last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not as with the meat some undeserved fault i’ll find about the making of the bed and here i’ll fling the pillow there the bolster this way the coverlet another way the sheets ay and amid this hurly i intend that all is done in reverend care of her and in conclusion she shall watch all night and if she chance to nod i’ll rail and brawl and with the clamour keep her still awake
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness and thus i’ll curb her mad and headstrong humour
he that knows better how to tame a shrew now let him speak ’tis charity to show
is ’t possible friend licio that mistress bianca doth fancy any other but lucentio
i tell you sir she bears me fair in hand
sir to satisfy you in what i have said stand by and mark the manner of his teaching
they stand aside enter bianca and lucentio
now mistress profit you in what you read
i read that i profess the art to love
and may you prove sir master of your art
while you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart
now tell me i pray you that durst swear that your mistress bianca lov’d none in the world so well as lucentio
i tell thee licio this is wonderful
mistake no more i am not licio
nor a musician as i seem to be but one that scorn to live in this disguise for such a one as leaves a gentleman and makes a god of such a cullion know sir that i am call’d hortensio
signior hortensio i have often heard of your entire affection to bianca and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness i will with you if you be so contented forswear bianca and her love for ever
see how they kiss and court
signior lucentio here is my hand and here i firmly vow never to woo her more but do forswear her as one unworthy all the former favours that i have fondly flatter’d her withal
and here i take the like unfeigned oath never to marry with her though she would entreat fie on her
see how beastly she doth court him
would all the world but he had quite forsworn
for me that i may surely keep mine oath i will be married to a wealthy widow ere three days pass which hath as long lov’d me as i have lov’d this proud disdainful haggard
kindness in women not their beauteous looks shall win my love and so i take my leave in resolution as i swore before
mistress bianca bless you with such grace as ’longeth to a lover’s blessed case
nay i have ta’en you napping gentle love and have forsworn you with hortensio
tranio you jest but have you both forsworn me
then we are rid of licio
i’ faith he’ll have a lusty widow now that shall be woo’d and wedded in a day
faith he is gone unto the taming school
what is there such a place
ay mistress and petruchio is the master that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
i have watch’d so long that i am dog weary but at last i spied an ancient angel coming down the hill will serve the turn
master a mercatante or a pedant i know not what but formal in apparel in gait and countenance surely like a father
if he be credulous and trust my tale i’ll make him glad to seem vincentio and give assurance to baptista minola as if he were the right vincentio
take in your love and then let me alone
exeunt lucentio and bianca enter a pedant
travel you far on or are you at the farthest
sir at the farthest for a week or two but then up farther and as far as rome and so to tripoli if god lend me life
marry god forbid and come to padua careless of your life
’tis death for anyone in mantua to come to padua
your ships are stay’d at venice and the duke — for private quarrel ’twixt your duke and him — hath publish’d and proclaim’d it openly
’tis marvel but that you are but newly come you might have heard it else proclaim’d about
it is worse for me than so for i have bills for money by exchange from florence and must here deliver them
well sir to do you courtesy this will i do and this i will advise you first tell me have you ever been at pisa
ay sir in pisa have i often been pisa renowned for grave citizens
among them know you one vincentio
i know him not but i have heard of him a merchant of incomparable wealth
he is my father sir and sooth to say in countenance somewhat doth resemble you
aside as much as an apple doth an oyster and all one
to save your life in this extremity this favour will i do you for his sake and think it not the worst of all your fortunes that you are like to sir vincentio
his name and credit shall you undertake and in my house you shall be friendly lodg’d look that you take upon you as you should
you understand me sir so shall you stay till you have done your business in the city
if this be courtesy sir accept of it
o sir i do and will repute you ever the patron of my life and liberty
then go with me to make the matter good
this by the way i let you understand my father is here look’d for every day to pass assurance of a dower in marriage ’twixt me and one baptista’s daughter here in all these circumstances i’ll instruct you
go with me to clothe you as becomes you
no no forsooth i dare not for my life
the more my wrong the more his spite appears
what did he marry me to famish me
beggars that come unto my father’s door upon entreaty have a present alms if not elsewhere they meet with charity but i who never knew how to entreat nor never needed that i should entreat am starv’d for meat giddy for lack of sleep with oaths kept waking and with brawling fed
and that which spites me more than all these wants he does it under name of perfect love as who should say if i should sleep or eat ’twere deadly sickness or else present death
i prithee go and get me some repast i care not what so it be wholesome food
what say you to a neat’s foot
’tis passing good i prithee let me have it
i fear it is too choleric a meat
how say you to a fat tripe finely broil’d
i like it well good grumio fetch it me
i cannot tell i fear ’tis choleric
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard
a dish that i do love to feed upon
ay but the mustard is too hot a little
why then the beef and let the mustard rest
nay then i will not you shall have the mustard or else you get no beef of grumio
then both or one or anything thou wilt
why then the mustard without the beef
go get thee gone thou false deluding slave beats him that feed’st me with the very name of meat
sorrow on thee and all the pack of you that triumph thus upon my misery
go get thee gone i say
enter petruchio with a dish of meat and hortensio
faith as cold as can be
pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me
here love thou seest how diligent i am to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee sets the dish on a table i am sure sweet kate this kindness merits thanks
nay then thou lov’st it not and all my pains is sorted to no proof
i pray you let it stand
the poorest service is repaid with thanks and so shall mine before you touch the meat
come mistress kate i’ll bear you company
aside eat it up all hortensio if thou lovest me
much good do it unto thy gentle heart
kate eat apace and now my honey love will we return unto thy father’s house and revel it as bravely as the best with silken coats and caps and golden rings with ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things with scarfs and fans and double change of bravery with amber bracelets beads and all this knavery
the tailor stays thy leisure to deck thy body with his ruffling treasure
come tailor let us see these ornaments lay forth the gown — enter haberdasher
here is the cap your worship did bespeak
why this was moulded on a porringer a velvet dish fie fie
’tis lewd and filthy why ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell a knack a toy a trick a baby’s cap away with it
come let me have a bigger
i’ll have no bigger this doth fit the time and gentlewomen wear such caps as these
when you are gentle you shall have one too and not till then
aside that will not be in haste
why sir i trust i may have leave to speak and speak i will
i am no child no babe
your betters have endur’d me say my mind and if you cannot best you stop your ears
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart or else my heart concealing it will break and rather than it shall i will be free even to the uttermost as i please in words
why thou say’st true it is a paltry cap a custard coffin a bauble a silken pie i love thee well in that thou lik’st it not
love me or love me not i like the cap and it i will have or i will have none
why ay come tailor let us see’t
what up and down carv’d like an apple tart
here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash like to a censer in a barber’s shop
why what i’ devil’s name tailor call’st thou this
aside i see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown
you bid me make it orderly and well according to the fashion and the time
marry and did but if you be remember’d i did not bid you mar it to the time
go hop me over every kennel home for you shall hop without my custom sir
i never saw a better fashion’d gown more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable belike you mean to make a puppet of me
why true he means to make a puppet of thee
she says your worship means to make a puppet of her
thou liest thou thread thou thimble thou yard three quarters half yard quarter nail
thou flea thou nit thou winter cricket thou
brav’d in mine own house with a skein of thread
thou rag thou quantity thou remnant or i shall so be mete thee with thy yard as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st
i tell thee i that thou hast marr’d her gown
your worship is deceiv’d the gown is made just as my master had direction
grumio gave order how it should be done
i gave him no order i gave him the stuff
but how did you desire it should be made
marry sir with needle and thread
but did you not request to have it cut
thou hast braved many men brave not me i will neither be fac’d nor brav’d
i say unto thee i bid thy master cut out the gown but i did not bid him cut it to pieces ergo thou liest
why here is the note of the fashion to testify
the note lies in ’s throat if he say i said so
’imprimis a loose bodied gown ’ grumio
master if ever i said loose bodied gown sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread i said a gown
’with a small compassed cape ’ grumio
’with a trunk sleeve ’ grumio
’the sleeves curiously cut ’ petruchio
error i’ the bill sir error i’ the bill
i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sew’d up again and that i’ll prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
this is true that i say and i had thee in place where thou shouldst know it
i am for thee straight take thou the bill give me thy mete yard and spare not me
then he shall have no odds
well sir in brief the gown is not for me
you are i’ the right sir ’tis for my mistress
go take it up unto thy master’s use
take up my mistress’ gown for thy master’s use
why sir what’s your conceit in that
o sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
take up my mistress’ gown to his master’s use
aside hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid
to tailor go take it hence be gone and say no more
aside to tailor tailor i’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow take no unkindness of his hasty words
well come my kate we will unto your father’s even in these honest mean habiliments
our purses shall be proud our garments poor for ’tis the mind that makes the body rich and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds so honour peereth in the meanest habit
what is the jay more precious than the lark because his feathers are more beautiful
or is the adder better than the eel because his painted skin contents the eye
o no good kate neither art thou the worse for this poor furniture and mean array
if thou account’st it shame lay it on me and therefore frolic we will hence forthwith to feast and sport us at thy father’s house
go call my men and let us straight to him and bring our horses unto long lane end there will we mount and thither walk on foot
let’s see i think ’tis now some seven o’clock and well we may come there by dinner time
i dare assure you sir ’tis almost two and ’twill be supper time ere you come there
it shall be seven ere i go to horse
look what i speak or do or think to do you are still crossing it
sirs let ’t alone i will not go today and ere i do it shall be what o’clock i say it is
why so this gallant will command the sun
enter tranio and the pedant dressed like vincentio tranio
sir this is the house please it you that i call
and but i be deceived signior baptista may remember me near twenty years ago in genoa where we were lodgers at the pegasus
’tis well and hold your own in any case with such austerity as ’longeth to a father
but sir here comes your boy ’twere good he were school’d
sirrah biondello now do your duty throughly i advise you
but hast thou done thy errand to baptista
i told him that your father was at venice and that you look’d for him this day in padua
th’art a tall fellow hold thee that to drink
signior baptista you are happily met
to the pedant sir this is the gentleman i told you of i pray you stand good father to me now give me bianca for my patrimony
sir pardon me in what i have to say
your plainness and your shortness please me well
right true it is your son lucentio here doth love my daughter and she loveth him or both dissemble deeply their affections and therefore if you say no more than this that like a father you will deal with him and pass my daughter a sufficient dower the match is made and all is done your son shall have my daughter with consent
where then do you know best we be affied and such assurance ta’en as shall with either part’s agreement stand
not in my house lucentio for you know pitchers have ears and i have many servants besides old gremio is hearkening still and happily we might be interrupted
then at my lodging and it like you there doth my father lie and there this night we’ll pass the business privately and well
send for your daughter by your servant here my boy shall fetch the scrivener presently
the worst is this that at so slender warning you are like to have a thin and slender pittance
cambio hie you home and bid bianca make her ready straight and if you will tell what hath happened lucentio’s father is arriv’d in padua and how she’s like to be lucentio’s wife
i pray the gods she may with all my heart
dally not with the gods but get thee gone
signior baptista shall i lead the way
one mess is like to be your cheer come sir we will better it in pisa
exeunt tranio pedant and baptista biondello
you saw my master wink and laugh upon you
faith nothing but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens
then thus baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son
his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper
the old priest at saint luke’s church is at your command at all hours
i cannot tell except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance
take your assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum to the church
take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses
if this be not that you look for i have more to say but bid bianca farewell for ever and a day
i cannot tarry i knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir and so adieu sir
my master hath appointed me to go to saint luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix
i may and will if she be so contented
she will be pleas’d then wherefore should i doubt
hap what hap may i’ll roundly go about her it shall go hard if cambio go without her exit scene v a public road

come on i’ god’s name once more toward our father’s
good lord how bright and goodly shines the moon

now by my mother’s son and that’s myself it shall be moon or star or what i list or ere i journey to your father’s house
go on and fetch our horses back again
evermore cross’d and cross’d nothing but cross’d
say as he says or we shall never go
forward i pray since we have come so far and be it moon or sun or what you please and if you please to call it a rush candle henceforth i vow it shall be so for me
i say it is the moon
i know it is the moon
nay then you lie it is the blessed sun
then god be bless’d it is the blessed sun but sun it is not when you say it is not and the moon changes even as your mind
what you will have it nam’d even that it is and so it shall be so for katherine
petruchio go thy ways the field is won

enter vincentio in a travelling dress
to vincentio good morrow gentle mistress where away
tell me sweet kate and tell me truly too hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman
such war of white and red within her cheeks
what stars do spangle heaven with such beauty as those two eyes become that heavenly face
fair lovely maid once more good day to thee
sweet kate embrace her for her beauty’s sake
a will make the man mad to make a woman of him
young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet whither away or where is thy abode
happy the parents of so fair a child happier the man whom favourable stars allot thee for his lovely bedfellow
i hope thou art not mad this is a man old wrinkled faded wither’d and not a maiden as thou sayst he is
pardon old father my mistaking eyes that have been so bedazzled with the sun that everything i look on seemeth green now i perceive thou art a reverend father pardon i pray thee for my mad mistaking
do good old grandsire and withal make known which way thou travellest if along with us we shall be joyful of thy company
fair sir and you my merry mistress that with your strange encounter much amaz’d me my name is called vincentio my dwelling pisa and bound i am to padua there to visit a son of mine which long i have not seen
happily met the happier for thy son
and now by law as well as reverend age i may entitle thee my loving father the sister to my wife this gentlewoman thy son by this hath married
wonder not nor be not griev’d she is of good esteem her dowry wealthy and of worthy birth beside so qualified as may beseem the spouse of any noble gentleman
let me embrace with old vincentio and wander we to see thy honest son who will of thy arrival be full joyous
or is it else your pleasure like pleasant travellers to break a jest upon the company you overtake
i do assure thee father so it is
come go along and see the truth hereof for our first merriment hath made thee jealous

what if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal
keep your hundred pounds to yourself he shall need none so long as i live
nay i told you your son was well beloved in padua
to leave frivolous circumstances i pray you tell signior lucentio that his father is come from pisa and is here at the door to speak with him
thou liest his father is come from padua and here looking out at the window
ay sir so his mother says if i may believe her
to vincentio why how now gentleman
why this is flat knavery to take upon you another man’s name
lay hands on the villain i believe a means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance
i have seen them in the church together god send ’em good shipping
now we are undone and brought to nothing
seeing biondello come hither crack hemp
i hope i may choose sir

first kiss me kate and we will
in the midst of the street
no sir god forbid but ashamed to kiss
nay i will give thee a kiss now pray thee love stay
come my sweet kate better once than never for never too late
enter baptista vincentio gremio the pedant lucentio bianca petruchio katherina hortensio and widow
tranio biondello and grumio and others attending
at last though long our jarring notes agree and time it is when raging war is done to smile at ’scapes and perils overblown
my fair bianca bid my father welcome while i with self same kindness welcome thine
brother petruchio sister katherina and thou hortensio with thy loving widow feast with the best and welcome to my house my banquet is to close our stomachs up after our great good cheer
pray you sit down for now we sit to chat as well as eat
nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat
padua affords this kindness son petruchio
padua affords nothing but what is kind
for both our sakes i would that word were true
now for my life hortensio fears his widow
then never trust me if i be afeard
you are very sensible and yet you miss my sense i mean hortensio is afeard of you
he that is giddy thinks the world turns round
my widow says thus she conceives her tale
kiss him for that good widow
’he that is giddy thinks the world turns round’ i pray you tell me what you meant by that
your husband being troubled with a shrew measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe and now you know my meaning
and i am mean indeed respecting you
a hundred marks my kate does put her down
spoke like an officer ha’ to thee lad
how likes gremio these quick witted folks
believe me sir they butt together well
an hasty witted body would say your head and butt were head and horn
ay mistress bride hath that awaken’d you
ay but not frighted me therefore i’ll sleep again
nay that you shall not since you have begun have at you for a bitter jest or two
i mean to shift my bush and then pursue me as you draw your bow
exeunt bianca katherina and widow petruchio
here signior tranio this bird you aim’d at though you hit her not therefore a health to all that shot and miss’d
lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound which runs himself and catches for his master
a good swift simile but something currish
’tis well sir that you hunted for yourself ’tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay
i thank thee for that gird good tranio
confess confess hath he not hit you here
a has a little gall’d me i confess and as the jest did glance away from me ’tis ten to one it maim’d you two outright
now in good sadness son petruchio i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all
well i say no and therefore for assurance let’s each one send unto his wife and he whose wife is most obedient to come at first when he doth send for her shall win the wager which we will propose
i’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound but twenty times so much upon my wife
go biondello bid your mistress come to me
son i’ll be your half bianca comes
i’ll have no halves i’ll bear it all myself
sir my mistress sends you word that she is busy and she cannot come
she’s busy and she cannot come
ay and a kind one too pray god sir your wife send you not a worse
sirrah biondello go and entreat my wife to come to me forthwith
nay then she must needs come
i am afraid sir do what you can yours will not be entreated
she says you have some goodly jest in hand she will not come she bids you come to her
worse and worse she will not come
o vile intolerable not to be endur’d
sirrah grumio go to your mistress say i command her come to me
the fouler fortune mine and there an end
now by my holidame here comes katherina
what is your will sir that you send for me
where is your sister and hortensio’s wife
they sit conferring by the parlour fire
go fetch them hither if they deny to come swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
away i say and bring them hither straight
here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life an awful rule and right supremacy and to be short what not that’s sweet and happy
now fair befall thee good petruchio
the wager thou hast won and i will add unto their losses twenty thousand crowns another dowry to another daughter for she is chang’d as she had never been
nay i will win my wager better yet and show more sign of her obedience her new built virtue and obedience
see where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion
re enter katherina with bianca and widow
katherine that cap of yours becomes you not off with that bauble throw it underfoot
katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down widow
lord let me never have a cause to sigh till i be brought to such a silly pass
what a foolish duty call you this
i would your duty were as foolish too the wisdom of your duty fair bianca hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper time
the more fool you for laying on my duty
katherine i charge thee tell these headstrong women what duty they do owe their lords and husbands
come come you’re mocking we will have no telling
come on i say and first begin with her
i say she shall and first begin with her
unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable
a woman mov’d is like a fountain troubled muddy ill seeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt
such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord — i am asham’d that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts
come come you froward and unable worms
my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands below your husband’s foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease
come on and kiss me kate
well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha’t
’tis a good hearing when children are toward
but a harsh hearing when women are froward
we three are married but you two are sped
’twas i won the wager to lucentio though you hit the white and being a winner god give you good night
now go thy ways thou hast tam’d a curst shrew
’tis a wonder by your leave she will be tam’d so
exeunt the tempest contents act i scene i
on a ship at sea a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard
on a ship at sea a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard
enter a shipmaster and a boatswain severally
speak to the mariners fall to ’t yarely or we run ourselves aground bestir bestir
blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough
enter alonso sebastian antonio ferdinand gonzalo and others
you mar our labour keep your cabins you do assist the storm
what cares these roarers for the name of king
good yet remember whom thou hast aboard
none that i more love than myself
you are a counsellor if you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present we will not hand a rope more
use your authority if you cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hap —cheerly good hearts —out of our way i say
i have great comfort from this fellow
methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him
stand fast good fate to his hanging
make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage
if he be not born to be hang’d our case is miserable
bring her to try wi’ th’ maincourse
a cry within a plague upon this howling
they are louder than the weather or our office
shall we give o’er and drown
have you a mind to sink
a pox o’ your throat you bawling blasphemous incharitable dog
hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker
we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art
i’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench
lay her a hold a hold
set her two courses off to sea again lay her off
what must our mouths be cold
the king and prince at prayers
let’s assist them for our case is as theirs
we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards
this wide chapp’d rascal—would thou might’st lie drowning the washing of ten tides
he’ll be hang’d yet though every drop of water swear against it and gape at wid’st to glut him
a confused noise within “mercy on us ”— “we split we split ”—“farewell my wife and children ”— “farewell brother ”—“we split we split we split ” antonio
let’s all sink wi’ th’ king
now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground
but i would fain die a dry death
if by your art my dearest father you have put the wild waters in this roar allay them
the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch but that the sea mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek dashes the fire out
i have suffered with those that i saw suffer
a brave vessel who had no doubt some noble creature in her dash’d all to pieces
o the cry did knock against my very heart
had i been any god of power i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallow’d and the fraughting souls within her
be collected no more amazement tell your piteous heart there’s no harm done
i have done nothing but in care of thee of thee my dear one thee my daughter who art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing of whence i am nor that i am more better than prospero master of a full poor cell and thy no greater father
more to know did never meddle with my thoughts
’tis time i should inform thee farther
lend thy hand and pluck my magic garment from me —so lays down his mantle lie there my art
wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
the direful spectacle of the wrack which touch’d the very virtue of compassion in thee i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul— no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou heard’st cry which thou saw’st sink
sit down for thou must now know farther
you have often begun to tell me what i am but stopp’d and left me to a bootless inquisition concluding “stay not yet ” prospero
the hour’s now come the very minute bids thee ope thine ear obey and be attentive
canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell
i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not out three years old
by any other house or person
of anything the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance
’tis far off and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants
had i not four or five women once that tended me
but how is it that this lives in thy mind
what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time
if thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here how thou cam’st here thou mayst
twelve year since miranda twelve year since thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power
sir are not you my father
thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter
and thy father was duke of milan and his only heir and princess no worse issued
what foul play had we that we came from thence
by foul play as thou say’st were we heav’d thence but blessedly holp hither
o my heart bleeds to think o’ th’ teen that i have turn’d you to which is from my remembrance
my brother and thy uncle call’d antonio— i pray thee mark me that a brother should be so perfidious —he whom next thyself of all the world i lov’d and to him put the manage of my state as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke being so reputed in dignity and for the liberal arts without a parallel those being all my study the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger being transported and rapt in secret studies
thy false uncle— dost thou attend me
being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them who t’ advance and who to trash for over topping new created the creatures that were mine i say or chang’d ’em or else new form’d ’em having both the key of officer and office set all hearts i’ th’ state to what tune pleas’d his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and suck’d my verdure out on ’t
i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retir’d o’er priz’d all popular rate in my false brother awak’d an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound
he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o’ the substitution and executing th’ outward face of royalty with all prerogative
hence his ambition growing— dost thou hear
your tale sir would cure deafness
to have no screen between this part he play’d and him he play’d it for he needs will be absolute milan
me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for sway wi’ th’ king of naples to give him annual tribute do him homage subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbow’d—alas poor milan — to most ignoble stooping
mark his condition and the event then tell me if this might be a brother
i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons
this king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brother’s suit which was that he in lieu o’ th’ premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to th’ purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i’ th’ dead of darkness the ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self
i not rememb’ring how i cried out then will cry it o’er again it is a hint that wrings mine eyes to ’t
hear a little further and then i’ll bring thee to the present business which now’s upon us without the which this story were most impertinent
wherefore did they not that hour destroy us
well demanded wench my tale provokes that question
dear they durst not so dear the love my people bore me nor set a mark so bloody on the business but with colours fairer painted their foul ends
in few they hurried us aboard a bark bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared a rotten carcass of a butt not rigg’d nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats instinctively have quit it
there they hoist us to cry to th’ sea that roar’d to us to sigh to th’ winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong
alack what trouble was i then to you
o a cherubin thou wast that did preserve me
thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deck’d the sea with drops full salt under my burden groan’d which rais’d in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue
some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity who being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i lov’d my books he furnish’d me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom
would i might but ever see that man
sit still and hear the last of our sea sorrow
here in this island we arriv’d and here have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit than other princes can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful
and now i pray you sir for still ’tis beating in my mind your reason for raising this sea storm
by accident most strange bountiful fortune now my dear lady hath mine enemies brought to this shore and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star whose influence if now i court not but omit my fortunes will ever after droop
here cease more questions thou art inclin’d to sleep ’tis a good dulness and give it way
i know thou canst not choose
miranda sleeps come away servant come
i come to answer thy best pleasure be’t to fly to swim to dive into the fire to ride on the curl’d clouds to thy strong bidding task ariel and all his quality
hast thou spirit perform’d to point the tempest that i bade thee
i boarded the king’s ship now on the beak now in the waist the deck in every cabin i flam’d amazement sometime i’d divide and burn in many places on the topmast the yards and boresprit would i flame distinctly then meet and join
jove’s lightning the precursors o’ th’ dreadful thunder claps more momentary and sight outrunning were not the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble yea his dread trident shake
who was so firm so constant that this coil would not infect his reason
not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and play’d some tricks of desperation
all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel then all afire with me the king’s son ferdinand with hair up staring—then like reeds not hair— was the first man that leapt cried “hell is empty and all the devils are here ” prospero
but was not this nigh shore
not a hair perish’d on their sustaining garments not a blemish but fresher than before and as thou bad’st me in troops i have dispers’d them ’bout the isle
the king’s son have i landed by himself whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting his arms in this sad knot
of the king’s ship the mariners say how thou hast dispos’d and all the rest o’ th’ fleet
safely in harbour is the king’s ship in the deep nook where once thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew from the still vex’d bermoothes there she’s hid the mariners all under hatches stowed who with a charm join’d to their suff’red labour i have left asleep and for the rest o’ th’ fleet which i dispers’d they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean flote bound sadly home for naples supposing that they saw the king’s ship wrack’d and his great person perish
ariel thy charge exactly is perform’d but there’s more work
what is the time o’ th’ day
the time ’twixt six and now must by us both be spent most preciously
since thou dost give me pains let me remember thee what thou hast promis’d which is not yet perform’d me
i prithee remember i have done thee worthy service told thee no lies made no mistakings serv’d without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise to bate me a full year
dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee
thou dost and think’st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep to run upon the sharp wind of the north to do me business in the veins o’ th’ earth when it is bak’d with frost
hast thou forgot the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy was grown into a hoop
i must once in a month recount what thou hast been which thou forget’st
this damn’d witch sycorax for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing from argier thou know’st was banish’d for one thing she did they would not take her life
this blue ey’d hag was hither brought with child and here was left by th’ sailors
thou my slave as thou report’st thyself wast then her servant and for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorr’d commands refusing her grand hests she did confine thee by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage into a cloven pine within which rift imprison’d thou didst painfully remain a dozen years within which space she died and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike
then was this island— save for the son that she did litter here a freckl’d whelp hag born—not honour’d with a human shape
dull thing i say so he that caliban whom now i keep in service
thou best know’st what torment i did find thee in thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears it was a torment to lay upon the damn’d which sycorax could not again undo it was mine art when i arriv’d and heard thee that made gape the pine and let thee out
if thou more murmur’st i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howl’d away twelve winters
pardon master i will be correspondent to command and do my spriting gently
do so and after two days i will discharge thee
go make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea
be subject to no sight but thine and mine invisible to every eyeball else
go take this shape and hither come in ’t
exit ariel awake dear heart awake
waking the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me
come on we’ll visit caliban my slave who never yields us kind answer
’tis a villain sir i do not love to look on
but as ’tis we cannot miss him he does make our fire fetch in our wood and serves in offices that profit us
come forth i say there’s other business for thee
re enter ariel like a water nymph
my quaint ariel hark in thine ear
my lord it shall be done
thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam come forth
as wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d with raven’s feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both
a south west blow on ye and blister you all o’er
for this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps side stitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins shall forth at vast of night that they may work all exercise on thee
thou shalt be pinch’d as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging than bees that made them
this island’s mine by sycorax my mother which thou tak’st from me
when thou cam’st first thou strok’st me and made much of me wouldst give me water with berries in ’t and teach me how to name the bigger light and how the less that burn by day and night and then i lov’d thee and show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle the fresh springs brine pits barren place and fertile
curs’d be i that did so
all the charms of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
for i am all the subjects that you have which first was mine own king and here you sty me in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me the rest o’ th’ island
thou most lying slave whom stripes may move not kindness
i have us’d thee filth as thou art with human care and lodg’d thee in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my child
thou didst prevent me i had peopled else this isle with calibans
abhorred slave which any print of goodness wilt not take being capable of all ill
i pitied thee took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour one thing or other when thou didst not savage know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish i endow’d thy purposes with words that made them known
but thy vile race though thou didst learn had that in ’t which good natures could not abide to be with therefore wast thou deservedly confin’d into this rock who hadst deserv’d more than a prison
you taught me language and my profit on ’t is i know how to curse
the red plague rid you for learning me your language
fetch us in fuel and be quick thou ’rt best to answer other business
if thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly what i command i’ll rack thee with old cramps fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din
his art is of such power it would control my dam’s god setebos and make a vassal of him
exit caliban re enter ariel playing and singing ferdinand following
come unto these yellow sands and then take hands curtsied when you have and kiss’d the wild waves whist
foot it featly here and there and sweet sprites bear the burden
the watch dogs bark burden dispersedly
i hear the strain of strutting chanticleer cry cock a diddle dow ferdinand
i’ th’ air or th’ earth
it sounds no more and sure it waits upon some god o’ th’ island
sitting on a bank weeping again the king my father’s wrack this music crept by me upon the waters allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air thence i have follow’d it or it hath drawn me rather —but ’tis gone
sings full fathom five thy father lies
of his bones are coral made
those are pearls that were his eyes
nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a sea change into something rich and strange
sea nymphs hourly ring his knell burden ding dong
now i hear them ding dong bell ferdinand
the ditty does remember my drown’d father
this is no mortal business nor no sound that the earth owes —i hear it now above me
the fringed curtains of thine eye advance and say what thou seest yond
believe me sir it carries a brave form
no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have such
this gallant which thou seest was in the wrack and but he’s something stain’d with grief —that’s beauty’s canker —thou mightst call him a goodly person he hath lost his fellows and strays about to find ’em
i might call him a thing divine for nothing natural i ever saw so noble
aside it goes on i see as my soul prompts it
i’ll free thee within two days for this
most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend
vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here my prime request which i do last pronounce is o you wonder
if you be maid or no
no wonder sir but certainly a maid
i am the best of them that speak this speech were i but where ’tis spoken
what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee
a single thing as i am now that wonders to hear thee speak of naples
he does hear me and that he does i weep myself am naples who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld the king my father wrack’d
yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan and his brave son being twain
aside the duke of milan and his more braver daughter could control thee if now ’twere fit to do’t
at the first sight they have changed eyes
delicate ariel i’ll set thee free for this
to ferdinand a word good sir
i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
why speaks my father so ungently
this is the third man that e’er i saw the first that e’er i sigh’d for
pity move my father to be inclin’d my way
if a virgin and your affection not gone forth i’ll make you the queen of naples
aside they are both in either’s powers
but this swift business i must uneasy make lest too light winning make the prize light
i charge thee that thou attend me
thou dost here usurp the name thou ow’st not and hast put thyself upon this island as a spy to win it from me the lord on ’t
no as i am a man
there’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple if the ill spirit have so fair a house good things will strive to dwell with ’t
to ferdinand follow me — to miranda speak not you for him he’s a traitor
to ferdinand come i’ll manacle thy neck and feet together sea water shalt thou drink thy food shall be the fresh brook mussels wither’d roots and husks wherein the acorn cradled
no i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power
he draws and is charmed from moving miranda
make not too rash a trial of him for he’s gentle and not fearful
i say my foot my tutor
put thy sword up traitor who mak’st a show but dar’st not strike thy conscience is so possess’d with guilt come from thy ward for i can here disarm thee with this stick and make thy weapon drop
sir have pity i’ll be his surety
one word more shall make me chide thee if not hate thee
thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he having seen but him and caliban foolish wench
to th’ most of men this is a caliban and they to him are angels
my affections are then most humble i have no ambition to see a goodlier man
to ferdinand come on obey thy nerves are in their infancy again and have no vigour in them
so they are my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
my father’s loss the weakness which i feel the wrack of all my friends nor this man’s threats to whom i am subdued are but light to me might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid all corners else o’ th’ earth let liberty make use of space enough have i in such a prison
thou hast done well fine ariel
to ariel hark what thou else shalt do me
be of comfort my father’s of a better nature sir than he appears by speech this is unwonted which now came from him
thou shalt be as free as mountain winds but then exactly do all points of my command
enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo adrian francisco and others
beseech you sir be merry you have cause so have we all of joy for our escape is much beyond our loss
our hint of woe is common every day some sailor’s wife the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe but for the miracle i mean our preservation few in millions can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with our comfort
he receives comfort like cold porridge
the visitor will not give him o’er so
look he’s winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike
when every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d comes to the entertainer— sebastian
dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed
you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should
fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
well i have done but yet— sebastian
which of he or adrian for a good wager first begins to crow
though this island seem to be desert — antonio
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible — sebastian
it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance
ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
the air breathes upon us here most sweetly
as if it had lungs and rotten ones
or as ’twere perfum’d by a fen
here is everything advantageous to life
of that there’s none or little
how lush and lusty the grass looks
with an eye of green in’t
no he doth but mistake the truth totally
but the rarity of it is —which is indeed almost beyond credit — sebastian
that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new dyed than stained with salt water
if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies
ay or very falsely pocket up his report
methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis
’twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen
what if he had said widower aeneas too
good lord how you take it
you make me study of that she was of carthage not of tunis
his word is more than the miraculous harp
he hath rais’d the wall and houses too
what impossible matter will he make easy next
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands
to alonso sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now queen
and the rarest that e’er came there
bate i beseech you widow dido
is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it
that sort was well fish’d for
when i wore it at your daughter’s marriage
you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense
would i had never married my daughter there
for coming thence my son is lost and in my rate she too who is so far from italy removed i ne’er again shall see her
o thou mine heir of naples and of milan what strange fish hath made his meal on thee
sir he may live i saw him beat the surges under him and ride upon their backs
he trod the water whose enmity he flung aside and breasted the surge most swoln that met him
his bold head ’bove the contentious waves he kept and oared himself with his good arms in lusty stroke to th’ shore that o’er his wave worn basis bowed as stooping to relieve him
i not doubt he came alive to land
sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banish’d from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t
you were kneel’d to and importun’d otherwise by all of us and the fair soul herself weigh’d between loathness and obedience at which end o’ th’ beam should bow
we have lost your son i fear for ever milan and naples have more widows in them of this business’ making than we bring men to comfort them
so is the dear’st o’ th’ loss
my lord sebastian the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in
you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster
it is foul weather in us all good sir when you are cloudy
had i plantation of this isle my lord — antonio
he’d sow ’t with nettle seed
and were the king on’t what would i do
’scape being drunk for want of wine
i’ th’ commonwealth i would by contraries execute all things for no kind of traffic would i admit no name of magistrate letters should not be known riches poverty and use of service none contract succession bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none no use of metal corn or wine or oil no occupation all men idle all and women too but innocent and pure no sovereignty — sebastian
yet he would be king on’t
the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning
all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour treason felony sword pike knife gun or need of any engine would i not have but nature should bring forth of it own kind all foison all abundance to feed my innocent people
none man all idle whores and knaves
i would with such perfection govern sir t’ excel the golden age
and —do you mark me sir
prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
i do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing
who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you
so you may continue and laugh at nothing still
what a blow was there given
an it had not fallen flat long
you are gentlemen of brave mettle
you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing
enter ariel invisible playing solemn music
we would so and then go a bat fowling
nay good my lord be not angry
no i warrant you i will not adventure my discretion so weakly
will you laugh me asleep for i am very heavy
all sleep but alonso sebastian and antonio alonso
i wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my thoughts i find they are inclin’d to do so
please you sir do not omit the heavy offer of it it seldom visits sorrow when it doth it is a comforter
we two my lord will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety
what a strange drowsiness possesses them
it is the quality o’ th’ climate
why doth it not then our eyelids sink
i find not myself dispos’d to sleep
they fell together all as by consent they dropp’d as by a thunder stroke
and yet methinks i see it in thy face what thou shouldst be
th’ occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head
do you not hear me speak
i do and surely it is a sleepy language and thou speak’st out of thy sleep
what is it thou didst say
this is a strange repose to be asleep with eyes wide open standing speaking moving and yet so fast asleep
noble sebastian thou let’st thy fortune sleep—die rather wink’st whiles thou art waking
thou dost snore distinctly there’s meaning in thy snores
i am more serious than my custom you must be so too if heed me which to do trebles thee o’er
i’ll teach you how to flow
do so to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me
o if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it
how in stripping it you more invest it
ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth
prithee say on the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim a matter from thee and a birth indeed which throes thee much to yield
thus sir although this lord of weak remembrance this who shall be of as little memory when he is earth’d hath here almost persuaded — for he’s a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade —the king his son’s alive ’tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d as he that sleeps here swims
i have no hope that he’s undrown’d
o out of that “no hope” what great hope have you
no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond but doubts discovery there
will you grant with me that ferdinand is drown’d
then tell me who’s the next heir of naples
she that is queen of tunis she that dwells ten leagues beyond man’s life she that from naples can have no note unless the sun were post— the man i’ th’ moon’s too slow—till newborn chins be rough and razorable she that from whom we all were sea swallow’d though some cast again and by that destiny to perform an act whereof what’s past is prologue what to come in yours and my discharge
’tis true my brother’s daughter’s queen of tunis so is she heir of naples ’twixt which regions there is some space
a space whose ev’ry cubit seems to cry out “how shall that claribel measure us back to naples
keep in tunis and let sebastian wake ” say this were death that now hath seiz’d them why they were no worse than now they are
there be that can rule naples as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo
i myself could make a chough of as deep chat
o that you bore the mind that i do
what a sleep were this for your advancement
and how does your content tender your own good fortune
i remember you did supplant your brother prospero
and look how well my garments sit upon me much feater than before my brother’s servants were then my fellows now they are my men
if ’twere a kibe ’twould put me to my slipper but i feel not this deity in my bosom twenty consciences that stand ’twixt me and milan candied be they and melt ere they molest
here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon if he were that which now he’s like that’s dead whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus to the perpetual wink for aye might put this ancient morsel this sir prudence who should not upbraid our course
for all the rest they’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
they’ll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour
thy case dear friend shall be my precedent as thou got’st milan i’ll come by naples
draw thy sword one stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest and i the king shall love thee
draw together and when i rear my hand do you the like to fall it on gonzalo
my master through his art foresees the danger that you his friend are in and sends me forth— for else his project dies—to keep them living
sings in gonzalo’s ear while you here do snoring lie open ey’d conspiracy his time doth take
if of life you keep a care shake off slumber and beware
then let us both be sudden
now good angels preserve the king
whiles we stood here securing your repose even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing like bulls or rather lions did ’t not wake you
it struck mine ear most terribly
’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear to make an earthquake
sure it was the roar of a whole herd of lions
upon mine honour sir i heard a humming and that a strange one too which did awake me
i shak’d you sir and cried as mine eyes open’d i saw their weapons drawn —there was a noise that’s verily
’tis best we stand upon our guard or that we quit this place let’s draw our weapons
lead off this ground and let’s make further search for my poor son
heavens keep him from these beasts
for he is sure i’ th’ island
prospero my lord shall know what i have done so king go safely on to seek thy son
enter caliban with a burden of wood
all the infections that the sun sucks up from bogs fens flats on prosper fall and make him by inch meal a disease
his spirits hear me and yet i needs must curse
but they’ll nor pinch fright me with urchin shows pitch me i’ the mire nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark out of my way unless he bid ’em but for every trifle are they set upon me sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me and after bite me then like hedgehogs which lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount their pricks at my footfall sometime am i all wound with adders who with cloven tongues do hiss me into madness
here comes a spirit of his and to torment me for bringing wood in slowly
i’ll fall flat perchance he will not mind me
here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all and another storm brewing i hear it sing i’ th’ wind
yond same black cloud yond huge one looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor
if it should thunder as it did before i know not where to hide my head yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls
a fish he smells like a fish a very ancient and fish like smell a kind of not of the newest poor john
were i in england now as once i was and had but this fish painted not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver there would this monster make a man any strange beast there makes a man
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead indian
legg’d like a man and his fins like arms
i do now let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by thunderbolt
thunder alas the storm is come again
my best way is to creep under his gaberdine there is no other shelter hereabout misery acquaints a man with strange bed fellows
i will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past
enter stephano singing a bottle in his hand
i shall no more to sea to sea here shall i die ashore— this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral
drinks the master the swabber the boatswain and i the gunner and his mate lov’d mall meg and marian and margery but none of us car’d for kate for she had a tongue with a tang would cry to a sailor “go hang ” she lov’d not the savour of tar nor of pitch yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch
then to sea boys and let her go hang this is a scurvy tune too but here’s my comfort
do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of ind
i have not scap’d drowning to be afeard now of your four legs for it hath been said as proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground and it shall be said so again while stephano breathes at’ nostrils
this is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got as i take it an ague
where the devil should he learn our language
i will give him some relief if it be but for that
if i can recover him and keep him tame and get to naples with him he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather
do not torment me prithee i’ll bring my wood home faster
he’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest
he shall taste of my bottle if he have never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit
if i can recover him and keep him tame i will not take too much for him
he shall pay for him that hath him and that soundly
thou dost me yet but little hurt thou wilt anon i know it by thy trembling now prosper works upon thee
open your mouth here is that which will give language to you cat
this will shake your shaking i can tell you and that soundly
gives caliban a drink you cannot tell who’s your friend open your chaps again
i should know that voice it should be—but he is drowned and these are devils
four legs and two voices a most delicate monster
his forward voice now is to speak well of his friend his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract
if all the wine in my bottle will recover him i will help his ague
i will pour some in thy other mouth
doth thy other mouth call me
this is a devil and no monster i will leave him i have no long spoon
if thou beest stephano touch me and speak to me for i am trinculo—be not afeared—thy good friend trinculo
if thou beest trinculo come forth
i’ll pull thee by the lesser legs if any be trinculo’s legs these are they
how cam’st thou to be the siege of this moon calf
i took him to be kill’d with a thunderstroke
but art thou not drown’d stephano
i hope now thou are not drown’d
i hid me under the dead moon calf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm
prithee do not turn me about
aside these be fine things an if they be not sprites
that’s a brave god and bears celestial liquor
swear by this bottle how thou cam’st hither—i escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o’erboard by this bottle
which i made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since i was cast ashore
i’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject for the liquor is not earthly
swum ashore man like a duck i can swim like a duck i’ll be sworn
though thou canst swim like a duck thou art made like a goose
o stephano hast any more of this
the whole butt man my cellar is in a rock by th’ seaside where my wine is hid
hast thou not dropped from heaven
out o’ the moon i do assure thee i was the man in the moon when time was
i have seen thee in her and i do adore thee
my mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush
i will furnish it anon with new contents
by this good light this is a very shallow monster
well drawn monster in good sooth
i’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ the island and i will kiss thy foot
by this light a most perfidious and drunken monster
when ’s god’s asleep he’ll rob his bottle
come on then down and swear
i shall laugh myself to death at this puppy headed monster
i could find in my heart to beat him — stephano
but that the poor monster’s in drink
i’ll show thee the best springs i’ll pluck thee berries i’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough
a plague upon the tyrant that i serve
i’ll bear him no more sticks but follow thee thou wondrous man
a most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a poor drunkard
i prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow and i with my long nails will dig thee pig nuts show thee a jay’s nest and instruct thee how to snare the nimble marmoset i’ll bring thee to clustering filberts and sometimes i’ll get thee young scamels from the rock
i prithee now lead the way without any more talking
trinculo the king and all our company else being drowned we will inherit here
fellow trinculo we’ll fill him by and by again
sings drunkenly farewell master farewell farewell trinculo
a howling monster a drunken monster
no more dams i’ll make for fish nor fetch in firing at requiring nor scrape trenchering nor wash dish ’ban ’ban cacaliban has a new master—get a new man freedom high day
there be some sports are painful and their labour delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters point to rich ends
this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but the mistress which i serve quickens what’s dead and makes my labours pleasures o she is ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed and he’s compos’d of harshness
i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness had never like executor
i forget but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours most busy least when i do it
alas now pray you work not so hard i would the lightning had burnt up those logs that you are enjoin’d to pile
pray set it down and rest you
when this burns ’twill weep for having wearied you
my father is hard at study pray now rest yourself he’s safe for these three hours
o most dear mistress the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do
if you’ll sit down i’ll bear your logs the while
pray give me that i’ll carry it to the pile
no precious creature i had rather crack my sinews break my back than you should such dishonour undergo while i sit lazy by
it would become me as well as it does you and i should do it with much more ease for my good will is to it and yours it is against
no noble mistress ’tis fresh morning with me when you are by at night
i do beseech you— chiefly that i might set it in my prayers— what is your name
i have broke your hest to say so
indeed the top of admiration worth what’s dearest to the world
full many a lady i have ey’d with best regard and many a time th’ harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear for several virtues have i lik’d several women never any with so full soul but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow’d and put it to the foil but you o you so perfect and so peerless are created of every creature’s best
i do not know one of my sex no woman’s face remember save from my glass mine own nor have i seen more that i may call men than you good friend and my dear father how features are abroad i am skilless of but by my modesty the jewel in my dower i would not wish any companion in the world but you nor can imagination form a shape besides yourself to like of
but i prattle something too wildly and my father’s precepts i therein do forget
i am in my condition a prince miranda i do think a king i would not so —and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the flesh fly blow my mouth
hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service there resides to make me slave to it and for your sake am i this patient log man
o heaven o earth bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event if i speak true if hollowly invert what best is boded me to mischief
i beyond all limit of what else i’ the world do love prize honour you
i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of
aside fair encounter of two most rare affections
heavens rain grace on that which breeds between ’em
at mine unworthiness that dare not offer what i desire to give and much less take what i shall die to want
but this is trifling and all the more it seeks to hide itself the bigger bulk it shows
and prompt me plain and holy innocence
i am your wife if you will marry me if not i’ll die your maid to be your fellow you may deny me but i’ll be your servant whether you will or no
my mistress dearest and i thus humble ever
ay with a heart as willing as bondage e’er of freedom here’s my hand
and mine with my heart in ’t and now farewell till half an hour hence
exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally prospero
so glad of this as they i cannot be who are surpris’d withal but my rejoicing at nothing can be more
i’ll to my book for yet ere supper time must i perform much business appertaining
enter caliban with a bottle stephano and trinculo
tell not me —when the butt is out we will drink water not a drop before therefore bear up and board ’em
they say there’s but five upon this isle we are three of them if th’ other two be brained like us the state totters
drink servant monster when i bid thee thy eyes are almost set in thy head
where should they be set else
he were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail
my man monster hath drown’d his tongue in sack for my part the sea cannot drown me i swam ere i could recover the shore five and thirty leagues off and on by this light
thou shalt be my lieutenant monster or my standard
your lieutenant if you list he’s no standard
but you’ll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither
moon calf speak once in thy life if thou beest a good moon calf
i’ll not serve him he is not valiant
thou liest most ignorant monster i am in case to justle a constable
why thou deboshed fish thou was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as i today
wilt thou tell a monstrous lie being but half a fish and half a monster
wilt thou let him my lord
that a monster should be such a natural
bite him to death i prithee
trinculo keep a good tongue in your head if you prove a mutineer the next tree
the poor monster’s my subject and he shall not suffer indignity
wilt thou be pleas’d to hearken once again to the suit i made to thee
will i kneel and repeat it
i will stand and so shall trinculo
as i told thee before i am subject to a tyrant a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island
thou liest thou jesting monkey thou i would my valiant master would destroy thee i do not lie
trinculo if you trouble him any more in his tale by this hand i will supplant some of your teeth
i say by sorcery he got this isle from me he got it
if thy greatness will revenge it on him —for i know thou dar’st but this thing dare not — stephano
thou shalt be lord of it and i’ll serve thee
how now shall this be compassed
canst thou bring me to the party
yea yea my lord i’ll yield him thee asleep where thou mayst knock a nail into his head
i do beseech thy greatness give him blows and take his bottle from him when that’s gone he shall drink nought but brine for i’ll not show him where the quick freshes are
trinculo run into no further danger interrupt the monster one word further and by this hand i’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors and make a stock fish of thee
didst thou not say he lied
strikes trinculo as you like this give me the lie another time
i did not give the lie
out o’ your wits and hearing too
this can sack and drinking do
a murrain on your monster and the devil take your fingers
now forward with your tale —prithee stand further off
beat him enough after a little time i’ll beat him too
why as i told thee ’tis a custom with him i’ th’ afternoon to sleep there thou mayst brain him having first seiz’d his books or with a log batter his skull or paunch him with a stake or cut his wezand with thy knife
remember first to possess his books for without them he’s but a sot as i am nor hath not one spirit to command they all do hate him as rootedly as i
he has brave utensils —for so he calls them — which when he has a house he’ll deck withal
and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter he himself calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman but only sycorax my dam and she but she as far surpasseth sycorax as great’st does least
is it so brave a lass
ay lord she will become thy bed i warrant and bring thee forth brave brood
monster i will kill this man
his daughter and i will be king and queen —save our graces —and trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys
dost thou like the plot trinculo
give me thy hand i am sorry i beat thee but while thou liv’st keep a good tongue in thy head
within this half hour will he be asleep
this will i tell my master
let us be jocund will you troll the catch you taught me but while ere
at thy request monster i will do reason any reason
come on trinculo let us sing
sings flout ’em and cout ’em and scout ’em and flout ’em thought is free caliban
ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe stephano
this is the tune of our catch played by the picture of nobody
if thou beest a man show thyself in thy likeness if thou beest a devil take ’t as thou list
he that dies pays all debts i defy thee
the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices that if i then had wak’d after long sleep will make me sleep again and then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when i wak’d i cried to dream again
this will prove a brave kingdom to me where i shall have my music for nothing
that shall be by and by i remember the story
let’s follow it and after do our work
i would i could see this taborer
enter alonso sebastian antonio gonzalo adrian francisco c gonzalo
by ’r lakin i can go no further sir my old bones ache here’s a maze trod indeed through forth rights and meanders
by your patience i needs must rest me
old lord i cannot blame thee who am myself attach’d with weariness to th’ dulling of my spirits sit down and rest
even here i will put off my hope and keep it no longer for my flatterer he is drown’d whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks our frustrate search on land
aside to sebastian i am right glad that he’s so out of hope
do not for one repulse forgo the purpose that you resolv’d to effect
aside to antonio the next advantage will we take throughly
aside to sebastian let it be tonight for now they are oppress’d with travel they will not nor cannot use such vigilance as when they are fresh
aside to antonio i say tonight no more
solemn and strange music and prospero above invisible
enter several strange shapes bringing in a banquet they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation and inviting the king c to eat they depart
now i will believe that there are unicorns that in arabia there is one tree the phoenix’ throne one phoenix at this hour reigning there
i’ll believe both and what does else want credit come to me and i’ll be sworn ’tis true travellers ne’er did lie though fools at home condemn them
if in naples i should report this now would they believe me
if i should say i saw such islanders — for certes these are people of the island — who though they are of monstrous shape yet note their manners are more gentle kind than of our human generation you shall find many nay almost any
aside honest lord thou hast said well for some of you there present are worse than devils
i cannot too much muse such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing— although they want the use of tongue—a kind of excellent dumb discourse
no matter since they have left their viands behind for we have stomachs — will’t please you taste of what is here
faith sir you need not fear
when we were boys who would believe that there were mountaineers dewlapp’d like bulls whose throats had hanging at ’em wallets of flesh
or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts
which now we find each putter out of five for one will bring us good warrant of
i will stand to and feed although my last no matter since i feel the best is past
brother my lord the duke stand to and do as we
enter ariel like a harpy claps his wings upon the table and with a quaint device the banquet vanishes
you are three men of sin whom destiny that hath to instrument this lower world and what is in’t —the never surfeited sea hath caused to belch up you and on this island where man doth not inhabit you ’mongst men being most unfit to live
i have made you mad and even with such like valour men hang and drown their proper selves
seeing alonso sebastian c draw their swords you fools
i and my fellows are ministers of fate the elements of whom your swords are temper’d may as well wound the loud winds or with bemock’d at stabs kill the still closing waters as diminish one dowle that’s in my plume
my fellow ministers are like invulnerable
if you could hurt your swords are now too massy for your strengths and will not be uplifted
but remember— for that’s my business to you —that you three from milan did supplant good prospero expos’d unto the sea which hath requit it him and his innocent child for which foul deed the powers delaying not forgetting have incens’d the seas and shores yea all the creatures against your peace
thee of thy son alonso they have bereft and do pronounce by me ling’ring perdition —worse than any death can be at once —shall step by step attend you and your ways whose wraths to guard you from— which here in this most desolate isle else falls upon your heads —is nothing but heart sorrow and a clear life ensuing
he vanishes in thunder then to soft music enter the shapes again and dance with mocks and mows and carry out the table prospero
aside bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou perform’d my ariel a grace it had devouring
of my instruction hast thou nothing bated in what thou hadst to say so with good life and observation strange my meaner ministers their several kinds have done
my high charms work and these mine enemies are all knit up in their distractions they now are in my power and in these fits i leave them while i visit young ferdinand —whom they suppose is drown’d — and his and mine lov’d darling
i’ the name of something holy sir why stand you in this strange stare
methought the billows spoke and told me of it the winds did sing it to me and the thunder that deep and dreadful organ pipe pronounc’d the name of prosper it did bass my trespass
therefore my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded and i’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded and with him there lie mudded
but one fiend at a time i’ll fight their legions o’er
all three of them are desperate their great guilt like poison given to work a great time after now ’gins to bite the spirits
i do beseech you that are of suppler joints follow them swiftly and hinder them from what this ecstasy may now provoke them to
if i have too austerely punish’d you your compensation makes amends for i have given you here a third of mine own life or that for which i live who once again i tender to thy hand all thy vexations were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven i ratify this my rich gift
o ferdinand do not smile at me that i boast her off for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise and make it halt behind her
i do believe it against an oracle
then as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchas’d take my daughter but if thou dost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be minister’d no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate sour ey’d disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed as hymen’s lamps shall light you
as i hope for quiet days fair issue and long life with such love as ’tis now the murkiest den the most opportune place the strong’st suggestion our worser genius can shall never melt mine honour into lust to take away the edge of that day’s celebration when i shall think or phoebus’ steeds are founder’d or night kept chain’d below
fairly spoke sit then and talk with her she is thine own
thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform and i must use you in such another trick
go bring the rabble o’er whom i give thee power here to this place
incite them to quick motion for i must bestow upon the eyes of this young couple some vanity of mine art it is my promise and they expect it from me
before you can say “come” and “go ” and breathe twice and cry “so so ” each one tripping on his toe will be here with mop and mow
do not approach till thou dost hear me call
look thou be true do not give dalliance too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw to th’ fire i’ the blood be more abstemious or else good night your vow
i warrant you sir the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver
bring a corollary rather than want a spirit appear and pertly
hail many colour’d messenger that ne’er dost disobey the wife of jupiter who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers diffusest honey drops refreshing showers and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown my bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down rich scarf to my proud earth why hath thy queen summon’d me hither to this short grass’d green
a contract of true love to celebrate and some donation freely to estate on the blest lovers
tell me heavenly bow if venus or her son as thou dost know do now attend the queen
since they did plot the means that dusky dis my daughter got her and her blind boy’s scandal’d company i have forsworn
of her society be not afraid
i met her deity cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son dove drawn with her
here thought they to have done some wanton charm upon this man and maid whose vows are that no bed right shall be paid till hymen’s torch be lighted but in vain
mars’s hot minion is return’d again her waspish headed son has broke his arrows swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows and be a boy right out
highest queen of state great juno comes i know her by her gait
go with me to bless this twain that they may prosperous be and honour’d in their issue
honour riches marriage blessing long continuance and increasing hourly joys be still upon you
juno sings her blessings on you ceres
earth’s increase foison plenty barns and gamers never empty vines with clust’ring bunches growing plants with goodly burden bowing spring come to you at the farthest in the very end of harvest
scarcity and want shall shun you ceres’ blessing so is on you ferdinand
this is a most majestic vision and harmonious charmingly
may i be bold to think these spirits
spirits which by mine art i have from their confines call’d to enact my present fancies
so rare a wonder’d father and a wise makes this place paradise
juno and ceres whisper and send iris on employment prospero
juno and ceres whisper seriously there’s something else to do hush and be mute or else our spell is marr’d
you nymphs call’d naiads of the windring brooks with your sedg’d crowns and ever harmless looks leave your crisp channels and on this green land answer your summons juno does command
come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate a contract of true love
you sun burn’d sicklemen of august weary come hither from the furrow and be merry make holiday your rye straw hats put on and these fresh nymphs encounter every one in country footing
enter certain reapers properly habited they join with the nymphs in a graceful dance towards the end whereof prospero starts suddenly and speaks after which to a strange hollow and confused noise they heavily vanish
aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy of the beast caliban and his confederates against my life the minute of their plot is almost come
this is strange your father’s in some passion that works him strongly
never till this day saw i him touch’d with anger so distemper’d
you do look my son in a mov’d sort as if you were dismay’d be cheerful sir our revels now are ended
these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloud capp’d towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind
we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep
sir i am vex’d bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled
be not disturb’d with my infirmity
if you be pleas’d retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two i’ll walk to still my beating mind
spirit we must prepare to meet with caliban
when i presented ceres i thought to have told thee of it but i fear’d lest i might anger thee
say again where didst thou leave these varlets
i told you sir they were red hot with drinking so full of valour that they smote the air for breathing in their faces beat the ground for kissing of their feet yet always bending towards their project
then i beat my tabor at which like unback’d colts they prick’d their ears advanc’d their eyelids lifted up their noses as they smelt music so i charm’d their ears that calf like they my lowing follow’d through tooth’d briers sharp furzes pricking goss and thorns which enter’d their frail shins at last i left them i’ th’ filthy mantled pool beyond your cell there dancing up to th’ chins that the foul lake o’erstunk their feet
this was well done my bird
thy shape invisible retain thou still the trumpery in my house go bring it hither for stale to catch these thieves
a devil a born devil on whose nature nurture can never stick on whom my pains humanely taken all all lost quite lost and as with age his body uglier grows so his mind cankers
i will plague them all even to roaring
re enter ariel loaden with glistering apparel c come hang them on this line
enter caliban stephano and trinculo all wet
pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall we now are near his cell
monster your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the jack with us
monster i do smell all horse piss at which my nose is in great indignation
if i should take a displeasure against you look you — trinculo
thou wert but a lost monster
good my lord give me thy favour still
be patient for the prize i’ll bring thee to shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly
ay but to lose our bottles in the pool
there is not only disgrace and dishonour in that monster but an infinite loss
that’s more to me than my wetting yet this is your harmless fairy monster
i will fetch off my bottle though i be o’er ears for my labour
seest thou here this is the mouth o’ th’ cell no noise and enter
do that good mischief which may make this island thine own for ever and i thy caliban for aye thy foot licker
i do begin to have bloody thoughts
look what a wardrobe here is for thee
let it alone thou fool it is but trash
we know what belongs to a frippery
put off that gown trinculo by this hand i’ll have that gown
what do you mean to dote thus on such luggage
let’t alone and do the murder first
if he awake from toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches make us strange stuff
mistress line is not this my jerkin
now is the jerkin under the line now jerkin you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin
do do we steal by line and level an’t like your grace
i thank thee for that jest
here’s a garment for ’t wit shall not go unrewarded while i am king of this country
“steal by line and level ” is an excellent pass of pate
monster come put some lime upon your fingers and away with the rest
we shall lose our time and all be turn’d to barnacles or to apes with foreheads villainous low
monster lay to your fingers help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is or i’ll turn you out of my kingdom
enter divers spirits in shape of dogs and hounds and hunt them about prospero and ariel setting them on
caliban stephano and trinculo are driven out go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions shorten up their sinews with aged cramps and more pinch spotted make them than pard or cat o’ mountain
at this hour lies at my mercy all mine enemies
shortly shall all my labours end and thou shalt have the air at freedom
for a little follow and do me service
enter prospero in his magic robes and ariel
now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not my spirits obey and time goes upright with his carriage
on the sixth hour at which time my lord you said our work should cease
i did say so when first i rais’d the tempest
say my spirit how fares the king and ’s followers
confin’d together in the same fashion as you gave in charge just as you left them all prisoners sir in the line grove which weather fends your cell they cannot budge till your release
the king his brother and yours abide all three distracted and the remainder mourning over them brimful of sorrow and dismay but chiefly him you term’d sir “the good old lord gonzalo”
his tears run down his beard like winter’s drops from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works ’em that if you now beheld them your affections would become tender
mine would sir were i human
hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their kind that relish all as sharply passion as they be kindlier mov’d than thou art
though with their high wrongs i am struck to th’ quick yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further
my charms i’ll break their senses i’ll restore and they shall be themselves
but this rough magic i here abjure and when i have requir’d some heavenly music —which even now i do — to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for i’ll break my staff bury it certain fathoms in the earth and deeper than did ever plummet sound i’ll drown my book
solem music re enter ariel after him alonso with a frantic gesture attended by gonzalo sebastian and antonio in like manner attended by adrian and francisco they all enter the circle which prospero had made and there stand charmed which prospero observing speaks
a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains now useless boil’d within thy skull
there stand for you are spell stopp’d
holy gonzalo honourable man mine eyes e’en sociable to the show of thine fall fellowly drops
the charm dissolves apace and as the morning steals upon the night melting the darkness so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason
my true preserver and a loyal sir to him thou follow’st i will pay thy graces home both in word and deed
most cruelly didst thou alonso use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act
thou art pinch’d for ’t now sebastian
flesh and blood you brother mine that entertain’d ambition expell’d remorse and nature who with sebastian — whose inward pinches therefore are most strong would here have kill’d your king i do forgive thee unnatural though thou art
their understanding begins to swell and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shores that now lie foul and muddy
not one of them that yet looks on me or would know me
ariel fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell
exit ariel i will discase me and myself present as i was sometime milan
quickly spirit thou shalt ere long be free
ariel re enters singing and helps to attire prospero
ariel where the bee sucks there suck i in a cowslip’s bell i lie there i couch when owls do cry
on the bat’s back i do fly after summer merrily
merrily merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hangs on the bough prospero
i shall miss thee but yet thou shalt have freedom so so so
to the king’s ship invisible as thou art there shalt thou find the mariners asleep under the hatches the master and the boatswain being awake enforce them to this place and presently i prithee
i drink the air before me and return or ere your pulse twice beat
all torment trouble wonder and amazement inhabits here
some heavenly power guide us out of this fearful country
behold sir king the wronged duke of milan prospero
for more assurance that a living prince does now speak to thee i embrace thy body and to thee and thy company i bid a hearty welcome
whe’er thou be’st he or no or some enchanted trifle to abuse me as late i have been i not know thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood and since i saw thee th’ affliction of my mind amends with which i fear a madness held me this must crave an if this be at all a most strange story
thy dukedom i resign and do entreat thou pardon me my wrongs
but how should prospero be living and be here
first noble friend let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot be measur’d or confin’d
whether this be or be not i’ll not swear
you do yet taste some subtleties o’ the isle that will not let you believe things certain
aside to sebastian and antonio but you my brace of lords were i so minded i here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you and justify you traitors at this time i will tell no tales
aside the devil speaks in him
for you most wicked sir whom to call brother would even infect my mouth i do forgive thy rankest fault all of them and require my dukedom of thee which perforce i know thou must restore
if thou beest prospero give us particulars of thy preservation how thou hast met us here whom three hours since were wrack’d upon this shore where i have lost — how sharp the point of this remembrance is — my dear son ferdinand
i am woe for ’t sir
irreparable is the loss and patience says it is past her cure
i rather think you have not sought her help of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content
as great to me as late and supportable to make the dear loss have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you for i have lost my daughter
o heavens that they were living both in naples the king and queen there
that they were i wish myself were mudded in that oozy bed where my son lies
when did you lose your daughter
i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth their words are natural breath but howsoe’er you have been justled from your senses know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan who most strangely upon this shore where you were wrack’d was landed to be the lord on’t
no more yet of this for ’tis a chronicle of day by day not a relation for a breakfast nor befitting this first meeting
this cell’s my court here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad pray you look in
my dukedom since you have given me again i will requite you with as good a thing at least bring forth a wonder to content ye as much as me my dukedom
here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda playing at chess
sweet lord you play me false
no my dearest love i would not for the world
yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle and i would call it fair play
if this prove a vision of the island one dear son shall i twice lose
though the seas threaten they are merciful
i have curs’d them without cause
now all the blessings of a glad father compass thee about
arise and say how thou cam’st here
how many goodly creatures are there here
o brave new world that has such people in ’t
what is this maid with whom thou wast at play
your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours is she the goddess that hath sever’d us and brought us thus together
sir she is mortal but by immortal providence she’s mine
i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice nor thought i had one
she is daughter to this famous duke of milan of whom so often i have heard renown but never saw before of whom i have receiv’d a second life and second father this lady makes him to me
i am hers but o how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness
there sir stop let us not burden our remembrances with a heaviness that’s gone
i have inly wept or should have spoke ere this
look down you gods and on this couple drop a blessed crown for it is you that have chalk’d forth the way which brought us hither
was milan thrust from milan that his issue should become kings of naples
o rejoice beyond a common joy and set it down with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage did claribel her husband find at tunis and ferdinand her brother found a wife where he himself was lost prospero his dukedom in a poor isle and all of us ourselves when no man was his own
to ferdinand and miranda give me your hands let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy
re enter ariel with the master and boatswain amazedly following
i prophesied if a gallows were on land this fellow could not drown
now blasphemy that swear’st grace o’erboard not an oath on shore
hast thou no mouth by land
the best news is that we have safely found our king and company
the next our ship — which but three glasses since we gave out split is tight and yare and bravely rigg’d as when we first put out to sea
aside to prospero sir all this service have i done since i went
aside to ariel my tricksy spirit
these are not natural events they strengthen from strange to stranger
if i did think sir i were well awake i’d strive to tell you
we were dead of sleep and —how we know not —all clapp’d under hatches where but even now with strange and several noises of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains and mo diversity of sounds all horrible we were awak’d straightway at liberty where we in all her trim freshly beheld our royal good and gallant ship our master cap’ring to eye her
on a trice so please you even in a dream were we divided from them and were brought moping hither
aside to prospero was’t well done
aside to ariel bravely my diligence
this is as strange a maze as e’er men trod and there is in this business more than nature was ever conduct of some oracle must rectify our knowledge
sir my liege do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business
at pick’d leisure which shall be shortly single i’ll resolve you which to you shall seem probable of every these happen’d accidents till when be cheerful and think of each thing well
aside to ariel come hither spirit set caliban and his companions free untie the spell
exit ariel how fares my gracious sir
there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not
re enter ariel driving in caliban stephano and trinculo in their stolen apparel
every man shift for all the rest and let no man take care for himself for all is but fortune —coragio
if these be true spies which i wear in my head here’s a goodly sight
o setebos these be brave spirits indeed
i am afraid he will chastise me
what things are these my lord antonio
very like one of them is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
mark but the badges of these men my lords then say if they be true
this mis shapen knave his mother was a witch and one so strong that could control the moon make flows and ebbs and deal in her command without her power
these three have robb’d me and this demi devil for he’s a bastard one had plotted with them to take my life
two of these fellows you must know and own this thing of darkness i acknowledge mine
i shall be pinch’d to death
is not this stephano my drunken butler
he is drunk now where had he wine
and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em
how cam’st thou in this pickle
i have been in such a pickle since i saw you last that i fear me will never out of my bones
i shall not fear fly blowing
i am not stephano but a cramp
you’d be king o’ the isle sirrah
i should have been a sore one then
this is as strange a thing as e’er i look’d on
he is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape
go sirrah to my cell take with you your companions
as you look to have my pardon trim it handsomely
ay that i will and i’ll be wise hereafter and seek for grace
what a thrice double ass was i to take this drunkard for a god and worship this dull fool
hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
exeunt caliban stephano and trinculo prospero
i long to hear the story of your life which must take the ear strangely
i’ll deliver all and promise you calm seas auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off
aside to ariel my ariel chick that is thy charge then to the elements be free and fare thou well
now my charms are all o’erthrown and what strength i have’s mine own which is most faint
now ’tis true i must be here confin’d by you or sent to naples
let me not since i have my dukedom got and pardon’d the deceiver dwell in this bare island by your spell but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands
gentle breath of yours my sails must fill or else my project fails which was to please
now i want spirits to enforce art to enchant and my ending is despair unless i be reliev’d by prayer which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults
as you from crimes would pardon’d be let your indulgence set me free
