<s> if you’ll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this </s>
<s> you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patched up your excuses </s>
<s> i know you could not lack—i am certain on’t— very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace </s>
<s> as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another </s>
<s> the third o’ th’ world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife </s>

<s> so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience—which not wanted shrewdness of policy too—i grieving grant did you too much disquiet </s>
<s> for that you must but say i could not help it </s>

<s> neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge </s>
<s> as nearly as i may i’ll play the penitent to you </s>
<s> but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it </s>
<s> truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case </s>

<s> for her own person it beggared all description she did lie in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue o’erpicturing that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature </s>
<s> on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with divers coloured fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did </s>
<s> her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i’ th’ eyes and made their bends adornings </s>
<s> at the helm a seeming mermaid steers </s>

<s> from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs </s>
<s> the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthroned i’ th’ market place did sit alone whistling to th’ air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature </s>
<s> upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper </s>

<s> our courteous antony whom ne’er the word of “no” woman heard speak being barbered ten times o’er goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only </s>
<s> she made great caesar lay his sword to bed </s>
<s> he ploughed her and she cropped </s>
<s> i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless pour breath forth </s>
<s> now antony must leave her utterly </s>
<s> age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety </s>

<s> what means this jest i pray you master tell me </s>
<s> yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth </s>
<s> hold take thou that and that </s>
<s> hold sir for god’s sake now your jest is earnest </s>
<s> upon what bargain do you give it me </s>

<s> sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail </s>
<s> but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more </s>
<s> your lordship speaks most infallibly of him </s>
<s> why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath </s>

<s> i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself </s>
<s> i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he’s unfellowed </s>

<s> why is this all imponed as you call it </s>

<s> and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer </s>
<s> i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial </s>

<s> nay task me to my word approve me lord </s>
<s> thou art the king of honour </s>
<s> no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him </s>
<s> these letters come from your father </s>
<s> he cannot come my lord he is grievous sick </s>
<s> zounds how has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time </s>
<s> under whose government come they along </s>
<s> his letters bear his mind not i my lord </s>
<s> i prithee tell me doth he keep his bed </s>
<s> he did my lord four days ere i set forth and at the time of my departure thence he was much fear’d by his physicians </s>
<s> i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited </s>
<s> his health was never better worth than now </s>
<s> this sickness doth infect the very life blood of our enterprise ’tis catching hither even to our camp </s>

<s> yet doth he give us bold advertisement that with our small conjunction we should on to see how fortune is disposed to us for as he writes there is no quailing now because the king is certainly possess’d of all our purposes </s>
<s> your father’s sickness is a maim to us </s>
<s> a perilous gash a very limb lopp’d off— and yet in faith it is not </s>
<s> his present want seems more than we shall find it </s>

<s> a comfort of retirement lives in this </s>
<s> a rendezvous a home to fly unto if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs </s>

<s> the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division </s>
<s> it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence </s>

<s> for well you know we of the off’ring side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement and stop all sight holes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us </s>
<s> this absence of your father’s draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of </s>
<s> i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against the kingdom with his help we shall o’erturn it topsy turvy down </s>

<s> worse than the sun in march this praise doth nourish agues </s>

<s> i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours </s>
<s> come let me taste my horse who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales </s>
<s> harry to harry shall hot horse to horse meet and ne’er part till one drop down a corse </s>

<s> i press me none but good householders yeomen’s sons inquire me out contracted bachelors such as had been asked twice on the banns such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck </s>

<s> certain horse of my cousin vernon’s are not yet come up </s>

<s> and i fear sir michael what with the sickness of northumberland whose power was in the first proportion and what with owen glendower’s absence thence who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in o’er rul’d by prophecies i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king </s>
<s> why my good lord you need not fear there is douglas and lord mortimer </s>
<s> but there is mordake vernon lord harry percy and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors noble gentlemen </s>
<s> but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales lord john of lancaster the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt and many more corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms </s>
<s> doubt not my lord they shall be well opposed </s>
<s> i hope no less yet needful ’tis to fear and to prevent the worst sir michael speed </s>

<s> then with the losers let it sympathize for nothing can seem foul to those that win </s>
<s> how now my lord of worcester </s>
<s> ’tis not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet </s>
<s> you have deceived our trust and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel </s>
<s> this is not well my lord this is not well </s>
<s> will you again unknit this churlish knot of all abhorred war and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light and be no more an exhaled meteor a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times </s>
<s> hear me my liege for mine own part i could be well content to entertain the lag end of my life with quiet hours </s>
<s> for i do protest i have not sought the day of this dislike </s>
<s> rebellion lay in his way and he found it </s>
<s> it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house and yet i must remember you my lord we were the first and dearest of your friends </s>
<s> for you my staff of office did i break in richard’s time and posted day and night to meet you on the way and kiss your hand when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i </s>
<s> it was myself my brother and his son that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time </s>
<s> you swore to us and you did swear that oath at doncaster that you did nothing purpose ’gainst the state nor claim no further than your new fall’n right the seat of gaunt dukedom of lancaster </s>
<s> to this we swore our aid </s>
<s> these things indeed you have articulate proclaim’d at market crosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation </s>
<s> and never yet did insurrection want such water colours to impaint his cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion </s>
<s> in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter if once they join in trial </s>
<s> tell your nephew the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy </s>

<s> hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so ’tis a point of friendship </s>

<s> well ’tis no matter honour pricks me on </s>

<s> or take away the grief of a wound </s>
<s> honour hath no skill in surgery then </s>
<s> what is in that word “honour” </s>
<s> but will it not live with the living </s>
<s> o no my nephew must not know sir richard the liberal and kind offer of the king </s>
<s> it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults </s>
<s> suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes for treason is but trusted like the fox who ne’er so tame so cherish’d and lock’d up will have a wild trick of his ancestors </s>
<s> look how we can or sad or merrily interpretation will misquote our looks and we shall feed like oxen at a stall the better cherish’d still the nearer death </s>

<s> all his offences live upon my head and on his father’s </s>

<s> there did he pause but let me tell the world if he outlive the envy of this day england did never owe so sweet a hope so much misconstrued in his wantonness </s>

<s> after him came spurring hard a gentleman almost forspent with speed that stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse </s>
<s> he ask’d the way to chester and of him i did demand what news from shrewsbury </s>
<s> he told me that rebellion had bad luck and that young harry percy’s spur was cold </s>
<s> with that he gave his able horse the head and bending forward struck his armed heels against the panting sides of his poor jade up to the rowel head and starting so he seem’d in running to devour the way staying no longer question </s>

<s> if that rebellion came like itself in base and abject routs led on by bloody youth guarded with rags and countenanced by boys and beggary i say if damn’d commotion so appear’d in his true native and most proper shape you reverend father and these noble lords had not been here to dress the ugly form of base and bloody insurrection with your fair honours </s>
<s> you lord archbishop whose see is by a civil peace maintain’d whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch’d whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor’d whose white investments figure innocence the dove and very blessed spirit of peace wherefore you do so ill translate yourself out of the speech of peace that bears such grace into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war turning your books to graves your ink to blood your pens to lances and your tongue divine to a loud trumpet and a point of war </s>
<s> briefly to this end we are all diseased and with our surfeiting and wanton hours have brought ourselves into a burning fever and we must bleed for it of which disease our late king richard being infected died </s>
<s> but my most noble lord of westmoreland i take not on me here as a physician nor do i as an enemy to peace troop in the throngs of military men but rather show awhile like fearful war to diet rank minds sick of happiness and purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop our very veins of life </s>
<s> i have in equal balance justly weigh’d what wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer and find our griefs heavier than our offences </s>

<s> when we are wrong’d and would unfold our griefs we are denied access unto his person even by those men that most have done us wrong </s>
<s> the dangers of the days but newly gone whose memory is written on the earth with yet appearing blood and the examples of every minute’s instance present now hath put us in these ill beseeming arms not to break peace or any branch of it but to establish here a peace indeed concurring both in name and quality </s>
<s> whenever yet was your appeal denied </s>
<s> wherein have you been galled by the king </s>
<s> what peer hath been suborn’d to grate on you that you should seal this lawless bloody book of forged rebellion with a seal divine and consecrate commotion’s bitter edge </s>
<s> my brother general the commonwealth to brother born an household cruelty i make my quarrel in particular </s>
<s> there is no need of any such redress or if there were it not belongs to you </s>
<s> why not to him in part and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before and suffer the condition of these times to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honours </s>
<s> o my good lord mowbray construe the times to their necessities and you shall say indeed it is the time and not the king that doth you injuries </s>
<s> yet for your part it not appears to me either from the king or in the present time that you should have an inch of any ground to build a grief on </s>
<s> were you not restored to all the duke of norfolk’s signories your noble and right well rememb’red father’s </s>
<s> what thing in honour had my father lost that need to be revived and breathed in me </s>
<s> you speak lord mowbray now you know not what </s>
<s> the earl of hereford was reputed then in england the most valiant gentleman </s>
<s> who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled </s>
<s> but if your father had been victor there he ne’er had borne it out of coventry for all the country in a general voice cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love were set on hereford whom they doted on and bless’d and graced indeed more than the king </s>
<s> but this is mere digression from my purpose </s>
<s> here come i from our princely general to know your griefs to tell you from his grace that he will give you audience and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just you shall enjoy them everything set off that might so much as think you enemies </s>
<s> but he hath forc’d us to compel this offer and it proceeds from policy not love </s>
<s> mowbray you overween to take it so this offer comes from mercy not from fear </s>
<s> for lo within a ken our army lies upon mine honour all too confident to give admittance to a thought of fear </s>
<s> our battle is more full of names than yours our men more perfect in the use of arms our armour all as strong our cause the best then reason will our hearts should be as good </s>

<s> there is a thing within my bosom tells me that no conditions of our peace can stand </s>
<s> fear you not that if we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute as our conditions shall consist upon our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains </s>
<s> yea but our valuation shall be such that every slight and false derived cause yea every idle nice and wanton reason shall to the king taste of this action that were our royal faiths martyrs in love we shall be winnow’d with so rough a wind that even our corn shall seem as light as chaff and good from bad find no partition </s>
<s> note this the king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances for he hath found to end one doubt by death revives two greater in the heirs of life and therefore will he wipe his tables clean and keep no tell tale to his memory that may repeat and history his loss to new remembrance </s>
<s> for full well he knows he cannot so precisely weed this land as his misdoubts present occasion </s>
<s> his foes are so enrooted with his friends that plucking to unfix an enemy he doth unfasten so and shake a friend </s>
<s> so that this land like an offensive wife that hath enraged him on to offer strokes as he is striking holds his infant up and hangs resolved correction in the arm that was uprear’d to execution </s>
<s> besides the king hath wasted all his rods on late offenders that he now doth lack the very instruments of chastisement so that his power like to a fangless lion may offer but not hold </s>
<s> ’tis very true and therefore be assured my good lord marshal if we do now make our atonement well our peace will like a broken limb united grow stronger for the breaking </s>

<s> doth his majesty incline to it or no </s>
<s> he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have opened to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal </s>
<s> how did this offer seem received my lord </s>
<s> with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his great grandfather </s>
<s> what was th’ impediment that broke this off </s>
<s> the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing </s>
<s> then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it </s>

<s> enter the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of ely </s>
<s> god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it </s>
<s> my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim </s>
<s> and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colours with the truth for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation of what your reverence shall incite us to </s>
<s> therefore take heed how you impawn our person how you awake our sleeping sword of war </s>
<s> we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint ’gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords that makes such waste in brief mortality </s>
<s> under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism </s>
<s> then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne </s>
<s> there is no bar to make against your highness’ claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant “no woman shall succeed in salic land ” which salic land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar </s>
<s> yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salic is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdu’d the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establish’d then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salic land which salic as i said ’twixt elbe and sala is at this day in germany call’d meissen </s>
<s> then doth it well appear the salic law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salic land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly suppos’d the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred twenty six and charles the great subdu’d the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five </s>
<s> besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france </s>
<s> hugh capet also who usurp’d the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey’d himself as the heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great </s>
<s> also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was re united to the crown of france </s>
<s> so that as clear as is the summer’s sun king pepin’s title and hugh capet’s claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female </s>
<s> so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp’d from you and your progenitors </s>
<s> may i with right and conscience make this claim </s>

<s> look back into your mighty ancestors </s>
<s> go my dread lord to your great grandsire’s tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your great uncle’s edward the black prince who on the french ground play’d a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp forage in blood of french nobility </s>
<s> o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action </s>
<s> awake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats </s>

<s> never king of england had nobles richer and more loyal subjects whose hearts have left their bodies here in england and lie pavilion’d in the fields of france </s>
<s> o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spiritualty will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors </s>
<s> we must not only arm to invade the french but lay down our proportions to defend against the scot who will make road upon us with all advantages </s>
<s> they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers </s>
<s> we do not mean the coursing snatchers only but fear the main intendment of the scot who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us for you shall read that my great grandfather never went with his forces into france but that the scot on his unfurnish’d kingdom came pouring like the tide into a breach with ample and brim fullness of his force galling the gleaned land with hot assays girdling with grievous siege castles and towns that england being empty of defence hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood </s>
<s> she hath been then more fear’d than harm’d my liege for hear her but exampl’d by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward’s fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sumless treasuries </s>
<s> but there’s a saying very old and true “if that you will france win then with scotland first begin ” for once the eagle england being in prey to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs playing the mouse in absence of the cat to tear and havoc more than she can eat </s>
<s> it follows then the cat must stay at home yet that is but a crush’d necessity since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves </s>

<s> therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honey bees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom </s>

<s> we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fett’red in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin’s mind </s>

<s> you cannot revel into dukedoms there </s>

<s> we never valu’d this poor seat of england and therefore living hence did give ourself to barbarous licence as ’tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home </s>

<s> and tell the pleasant prince this mock of his hath turn’d his balls to gun stones and his soul shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them for many a thousand widows shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands mock mothers from their sons mock castles down and some are yet ungotten and unborn that shall have cause to curse the dauphin’s scorn </s>
<s> but this lies all within the will of god to whom i do appeal and in whose name tell you the dauphin i am coming on to venge me as i may and to put forth my rightful hand in a well hallow’d cause </s>
<s> so get you hence in peace and tell the dauphin his jest will savour but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it — convey them with safe conduct —fare you well </s>
<s> we hope to make the sender blush at it </s>

<s> therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army </s>

<s> the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services </s>

<s> the palace enter suffolk in conference with the king gloucester and exeter king henry </s>
<s> your wondrous rare description noble earl of beauteous margaret hath astonish d me </s>
<s> her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love s settled passions in my heart and like as rigour of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love </s>
<s> this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise </s>
<s> the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them would make a volume of enticing lines able to ravish any dull conceit and which is more she is not so divine so full replete with choice of all delights but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command command i mean of virtuous intents to love and honour henry as her lord </s>
<s> and otherwise will henry ne er presume </s>
<s> therefore my lord protector give consent that margaret may be england s royal queen </s>
<s> so should i give consent to flatter sin </s>
<s> you know my lord your highness is betroth d unto another lady of esteem </s>
<s> how shall we then dispense with that contract and not deface your honour with reproach </s>
<s> as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths or one that at a triumph having vow d to try his strength forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary s odds a poor earl s daughter is unequal odds and therefore may be broke without offence </s>
<s> why what i pray is margaret more than that </s>
<s> her father is no better than an earl although in glorious titles he excel </s>
<s> yes my lord her father is a king the king of naples and jerusalem and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance </s>
<s> and so the earl of armagnac may do because he is near kinsman unto charles </s>
<s> beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower where reignier sooner will receive than give </s>
<s> disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love </s>
<s> henry is able to enrich his queen and not to seek a queen to make him rich </s>
<s> so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as market men for oxen sheep or horse </s>
<s> marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed </s>
<s> and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons bindeth us in our opinions she should be preferr d for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife </s>
<s> whereas the contrary bringeth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace </s>
<s> whom should we match with henry being a king but margaret that is daughter to a king </s>
<s> her peerless feature joined with her birth approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit more than in women commonly is seen will answer our hope in issue of a king for henry son unto a conqueror is likely to beget more conquerors if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link d in love </s>
<s> then yield my lords and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen and none but she </s>
<s> whether it be through force of your report my noble lord of suffolk or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love i cannot tell but this i am assur d i feel such sharp dissension in my breast such fierce alarums both of hope and fear as i am sick with working of my thoughts </s>
<s> take therefore shipping post my lord to france agree to any covenants and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown d king henry s faithful and anointed queen </s>
<s> for your expenses and sufficient charge among the people gather up a tenth </s>
<s> be gone i say for till you do return i rest perplexed with a thousand cares </s>
<s> and you good uncle banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were not what you are i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will </s>
<s> and so conduct me where from company i may revolve and ruminate my grief </s>
<s> ay grief i fear me both at first and last </s>

<s> with god preserve the good duke humphrey </s>
<s> i fear me lords for all this flattering gloss he will be found a dangerous protector </s>

<s> look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule a while yet heav ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs </s>

<s> yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well </s>
<s> yea brother richard are you offended too </s>
<s> no god forbid that i should wish them sever d whom god hath join d together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together </s>
<s> setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england s queen </s>
<s> and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think </s>
<s> then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona </s>
<s> and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage </s>
<s> what if both lewis and warwick be appeas d by such invention as i can devise </s>
<s> yet to have join d with france in such alliance would more have strength ned this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage </s>
<s> why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself </s>
<s> but the safer when tis back d with france </s>
<s> tis better using france than trusting france </s>
<s> let us be back d with god and with the seas which he hath giv n for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves </s>
<s> in them and in ourselves our safety lies </s>
<s> for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford </s>

<s> is it for a wife that thou art malcontent </s>
<s> in choosing for yourself you show d your judgment which being shallow you shall give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you </s>
<s> leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brother s will </s>
<s> my lords before it pleas d his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune </s>
<s> but as this title honours me and mine so your dislikes to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow </s>
<s> my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns </s>
<s> what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey </s>
<s> nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath </s>

<s> what answer makes king lewis unto our letters </s>
<s> at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward the supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride </s>

<s> belike she minds to play the amazon </s>
<s> but what said warwick to these injuries </s>
<s> he more incens d against your majesty than all the rest discharg d me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore i ll uncrown him ere t be long </s>
<s> durst the traitor breathe out so proud words </s>
<s> well i will arm me being thus forewarn d </s>
<s> they shall have wars and pay for their presumption </s>
<s> but say is warwick friends with margaret </s>
<s> ay gracious sovereign they are so link d in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick s daughter </s>
<s> belike the elder clarence will have the younger </s>
<s> now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwick s other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself </s>
<s> you that love me and warwick follow me </s>
<s> my thoughts aim at a further matter i stay not for the love of edward but the crown </s>
<s> clarence and somerset both gone to warwick </s>
<s> yet am i arm d against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desp rate case </s>
<s> pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed </s>
<s> myself in person will straight follow you </s>
<s> exeunt pembroke and stafford but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt </s>
<s> you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance </s>

<s> this respite shook the bosom of my conscience enter d me yea with a splitting power and made to tremble the region of my breast which forc d such way that many maz d considerings did throng and press d in with this caution </s>
<s> first methought i stood not in the smile of heaven who had commanded nature that my lady s womb if it conceiv d a male child by me should do no more offices of life to t than the grave does to the dead for her male issue or died where they were made or shortly after this world had air d them </s>

<s> then follows that i weigh d the danger which my realms stood in by this my issue s fail and that gave to me many a groaning throe </s>
<s> thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience i did steer toward this remedy whereupon we are now present here together that s to say i meant to rectify my conscience which i then did feel full sick and yet not well by all the reverend fathers of the land and doctors learn d </s>

<s> i then mov d you my lord of canterbury and got your leave to make this present summons </s>
<s> unsolicited i left no reverend person in this court but by particular consent proceeded under your hands and seals therefore go on for no dislike i th world against the person of the good queen but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons drives this forward </s>
<s> prove but our marriage lawful by my life and kingly dignity we are contented to wear our moral state to come with her katharine our queen before the primest creature that s paragon d o th world </s>
<s> so please your highness the queen being absent tis a needful fitness that we adjourn this court till further day meanwhile must be an earnest motion made to the queen to call back her appeal she intends unto his holiness </s>

<s> i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winter’s cold as well as he for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me “dar’st thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point ” upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow so indeed he did </s>
<s> the torrent roar’d and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy </s>
<s> but ere we could arrive the point propos’d caesar cried “help me cassius or i sink ” i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar </s>
<s> and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him </s>
<s> he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake ’tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their colour fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his lustre </s>

<s> casca will tell us what the matter is </s>

<s> seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mock’d himself and scorn’d his spirit that could be mov’d to smile at anything </s>

<s> and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refus’d it the rabblement hooted and clapp’d their chopt hands and threw up their sweaty night caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refus’d the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swooned and fell down at it </s>
<s> and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air </s>
<s> he fell down in the market place and foam’d at mouth and was speechless </s>
<s> ’tis very like he hath the falling sickness </s>
<s> no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness </s>
<s> i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down </s>
<s> if the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man </s>
<s> what said he when he came unto himself </s>
<s> marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he pluck’d me ope his doublet and offer’d them his throat to cut </s>
<s> and i had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues </s>
<s> when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desir’d their worships to think it was his infirmity </s>
<s> three or four wenches where i stood cried “alas good soul ” and forgave him with all their hearts </s>
<s> but there’s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabb’d their mothers they would have done no less </s>
<s> and after that he came thus sad away </s>
<s> nay and i tell you that i’ll ne’er look you i’ the face again </s>
<s> but those that understood him smil’d at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me </s>
<s> i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesar’s images are put to silence </s>
<s> there was more foolery yet if i could remember it </s>
<s> will you sup with me tonight casca </s>

<s> for this time i will leave you tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you </s>

<s> if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humour me </s>
<s> i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesar’s ambition shall be glanced at </s>

<s> are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm </s>
<s> o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have riv’d the knotty oaks and i have seen th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire </s>
<s> either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction </s>
<s> why saw you anything more wonderful </s>
<s> a common slave you’d know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches join’d and yet his hand not sensible of fire remain’d unscorch’d </s>
<s> besides i ha’ not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glared upon me and went surly by without annoying me </s>
<s> and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets </s>

<s> now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are </s>

<s> therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love </s>

<s> i pray thee over name them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection </s>
<s> first there is the neapolitan prince </s>
<s> ay that’s a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself </s>
<s> i am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith </s>
<s> then is there the county palatine </s>
<s> he doth nothing but frown as who should say “and you will not have me choose ” he hears merry tales and smiles not </s>
<s> i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth </s>
<s> i had rather be married to a death’s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these </s>
<s> god defend me from these two </s>
<s> how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon </s>
<s> god made him and therefore let him pass for a man </s>
<s> in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he </s>
<s> why he hath a horse better than the neapolitan’s a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine </s>
<s> he is every man in no man </s>
<s> if a throstle sing he falls straight a cap’ring </s>
<s> he will fence with his own shadow </s>
<s> if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands </s>
<s> if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him </s>
<s> what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england </s>
<s> you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english </s>
<s> he is a proper man’s picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show </s>
<s> i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behaviour everywhere </s>
<s> what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour </s>
<s> that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able </s>
<s> i think the frenchman became his surety and seal’d under for another </s>
<s> how like you the young german the duke of saxony’s nephew </s>
<s> very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast </s>
<s> and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him </s>
<s> if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father’s will if you should refuse to accept him </s>
<s> therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it </s>
<s> i will do anything nerissa ere i will be married to a sponge </s>
<s> you need not fear lady the having any of these lords </s>
<s> they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets </s>
<s> if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my father’s will </s>
<s> i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence </s>
<s> and i pray god grant them a fair departure </s>
<s> do you not remember lady in your father’s time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat </s>
<s> yes yes it was bassanio as i think so was he call’d </s>
<s> he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon was the best deserving a fair lady </s>
<s> i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise </s>
<s> the four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave </s>
<s> and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the prince of morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight </s>
<s> if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach </s>
<s> if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me </s>
<s> whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the door </s>
<s> enter bassanio with shylock the jew </s>
<s> for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound </s>
<s> three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound </s>
<s> have you heard any imputation to the contrary </s>
<s> ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient </s>
<s> yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies </s>
<s> i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad </s>
<s> but ships are but boards sailors but men there be land rats and water rats water thieves and land thieves—i mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks </s>

<s> i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice </s>
<s> if i can catch him once upon the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him </s>

<s> from tripolis from mexico and england from lisbon barbary and india and not one vessel scape the dreadful touch of merchant marring rocks </s>
<s> besides it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew he would not take it </s>
<s> never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man </s>
<s> he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice </s>
<s> twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond </s>
<s> when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus his countrymen that he would rather have antonio’s flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him </s>

<s> is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble </s>

<s> antonio and old shylock both stand forth </s>
<s> of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed </s>
<s> you stand within his danger do you not </s>
<s> then must the jew be merciful </s>
<s> the quality of mercy is not strain’d it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath </s>
<s> it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes </s>
<s> ’tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown </s>
<s> his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest god’s when mercy seasons justice </s>
<s> therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation </s>
<s> we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy </s>
<s> i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there </s>
<s> i crave the law the penalty and forfeit of my bond </s>
<s> is he not able to discharge the money </s>
<s> yes here i tender it for him in the court yea twice the sum if that will not suffice i will be bound to pay it ten times o’er on forfeit of my hands my head my heart </s>
<s> if this will not suffice it must appear that malice bears down truth </s>
<s> and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority </s>
<s> to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will </s>
<s> it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established ’twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state </s>
<s> o wise young judge how i do honour thee </s>
<s> i pray you let me look upon the bond </s>
<s> here ’tis most reverend doctor here it is </s>
<s> shylock there’s thrice thy money offered thee </s>
<s> i have an oath in heaven </s>
<s> shall i lay perjury upon my soul </s>
<s> why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant’s heart </s>
<s> be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond </s>
<s> when it is paid according to the tenour </s>
<s> it doth appear you are a worthy judge you know the law your exposition hath been most sound </s>
<s> i charge you by the law whereof you are a well deserving pillar proceed to judgment </s>
<s> by my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me </s>
<s> i stay here on my bond </s>
<s> most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment </s>
<s> why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife </s>
<s> for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond </s>

<s> you merchant have you anything to say </s>
<s> i am arm’d and well prepar’d </s>
<s> fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which ling’ring penance of such misery doth she cut me off </s>
<s> commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonio’s end say how i lov’d you speak me fair in death </s>

<s> now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judge’s clerk a prating boy that begg’d it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him </s>
<s> you were to blame —i must be plain with you — to part so slightly with your wife’s first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh </s>

<s> ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine </s>
<s> then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for pyramus and thisbe says the story did talk through the chink of a wall </s>
<s> snout you can never bring in a wall </s>

<s> stol’n hence and left me asleep </s>
<s> i have had a most rare vision </s>

<s> the eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man’s hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was </s>
<s> i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream it shall be called ‘bottom’s dream’ because it hath no bottom and i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke </s>

<s> you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he </s>
<s> no he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens </s>
<s> yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice </s>
<s> a paramour is god bless us a thing of naught </s>
<s> snug masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married </s>

<s> how many gentlemen have you lost in this action </s>
<s> but few of any sort and none of name </s>
<s> a victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers </s>
<s> i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honour on a young florentine called claudio </s>
<s> much deserved on his part and equally remembered by don pedro </s>
<s> he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion he hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how </s>

<s> yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment </s>

<s> well i’ll be revenged as i may </s>
<s> troth my lord i have played the part of lady fame </s>
<s> i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren </s>
<s> i told him and i think i told him true that your grace had got the good will of this young lady and i offered him my company to a willow tree either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him up a rod as being worthy to be whipped </s>

<s> indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and i gave him use for it a double heart for a single one marry once before he won it of me with false dice therefore your grace may well say i have lost it </s>
<s> you have put him down lady you have put him down </s>
<s> so i would not he should do me my lord lest i should prove the mother of fools </s>
<s> i have brought count claudio whom you sent me to seek </s>
<s> the count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion </s>
<s> i’ faith lady i think your blazon to be true though i’ll be sworn if he be so his conceit is false </s>
<s> here claudio i have wooed in thy name and fair hero is won i have broke with her father and his good will obtained name the day of marriage and god give thee joy </s>
<s> count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes his grace hath made the match and all grace say amen to it </s>

<s> in faith lady you have a merry heart </s>
<s> yea my lord i thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care </s>
<s> my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart </s>
<s> thus goes everyone to the world but i and i am sunburnt </s>
<s> i may sit in a corner and cry heigh ho for a husband </s>
<s> lady beatrice i will get you one </s>
<s> i would rather have one of your father’s getting </s>
<s> hath your grace ne’er a brother like you </s>
<s> your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them </s>
<s> no my lord unless i might have another for working days your grace is too costly to wear every day </s>
<s> but i beseech your grace pardon me i was born to speak all mirth and no matter </s>
<s> your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes you for out of question you were born in a merry hour </s>
<s> no sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star danced and under that was i born </s>
<s> niece will you look to those things i told you of </s>
<s> by my troth a pleasant spirited lady </s>
<s> there’s little of the melancholy element in her my lord she is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing </s>
<s> she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband </s>
<s> by no means she mocks all her wooers out of suit </s>
<s> she were an excellent wife for benedick </s>
<s> my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad </s>
<s> count claudio when mean you to go to church </s>
<s> time goes on crutches till love have all his rites </s>
<s> not till monday my dear son which is hence a just seven night and a time too brief too to have all things answer my mind </s>
<s> come you shake the head at so long a breathing but i warrant thee claudio the time shall not go dully by us </s>
<s> i will in the interim undertake one of hercules’ labours which is to bring signior benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of affection the one with the other </s>
<s> i would fain have it a match and i doubt not but to fashion it if you three will but minister such assistance as i shall give you direction </s>
<s> my lord i am for you though it cost me ten nights’ watchings </s>
<s> i will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband </s>
<s> and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that i know </s>
<s> thus far can i praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valour and confirmed honesty </s>
<s> i will teach you how to humour your cousin that she shall fall in love with benedick and i with your two helps will so practise on benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach he shall fall in love with beatrice </s>
<s> if we can do this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are the only love gods </s>
<s> go in with me and i will tell you my drift </s>
<s> it is so the count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato </s>
<s> yea my lord but i can cross it </s>
<s> any bar any cross any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine </s>
<s> how canst thou cross this marriage </s>
<s> not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me </s>
<s> i think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero </s>
<s> i can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window </s>
<s> what life is in that to be the death of this marriage </s>
<s> the poison of that lies in you to temper </s>
<s> go you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned claudio —whose estimation do you mightily hold up —to a contaminated stale such a one as hero </s>
<s> what proof shall i make of that </s>
<s> proof enough to misuse the prince to vex claudio to undo hero and kill leonato </s>
<s> look you for any other issue </s>
<s> only to despite them i will endeavour anything </s>
<s> go then find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loves me intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio as—in love of your brother’s honour who hath made this match and his friend’s reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid —that you have discovered thus </s>
<s> they will scarcely believe this without trial offer them instances which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me call margaret hero hear margaret term me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meantime i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appear such seeming truth of hero’s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called assurance and all the preparation overthrown </s>
<s> grow this to what adverse issue it can i will put it in practice </s>
<s> be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducats </s>
<s> be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me </s>
<s> i will presently go learn their day of marriage </s>
<s> in my chamber window lies a book bring it hither to me in the orchard </s>
<s> i know that but i would have thee hence and here again </s>
<s> exit boy i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such a man is claudio </s>
<s> i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet </s>

<s> ay — aside to don pedro stalk on stalk on the fowl sits </s>
<s> i did never think that lady would have loved any man </s>
<s> no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours seemed ever to abhor </s>
<s> sits the wind in that corner </s>
<s> by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought </s>
<s> there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it </s>
<s> why what effects of passion shows she </s>
<s> aside bait the hook well this fish will bite </s>
<s> she will sit you to claudio you heard my daughter tell you how </s>
<s> you amaze me i would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection </s>
<s> i would have sworn it had my lord especially against benedick </s>
<s> aside i should think this a gull but that the white bearded fellow speaks it knavery cannot sure hide itself in such reverence </s>
<s> aside he hath ta’en the infection hold it up </s>
<s> hath she made her affection known to benedick </s>
<s> no and swears she never will that’s her torment </s>
<s> ’tis true indeed so your daughter says ‘shall i ’ says she ‘that have so oft encountered him with scorn write to him that i love him ’ leonato </s>
<s> this says she now when she is beginning to write to him for she’ll be up twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells us all </s>
<s> now you talk of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of </s>
<s> when she had writ it and was reading it over she found benedick and beatrice between the sheet </s>
<s> she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her ‘i measure him ’ says she ‘by my own spirit for i should flout him if he writ to me yea though i love him i should ’ claudio </s>

<s> i pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say </s>
<s> hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness </s>
<s> she doth well if she should make tender of her love ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it for the man —as you know all —hath a contemptible spirit </s>
<s> he is a very proper man </s>

<s> well we will hear further of it by your daughter let it cool the while </s>

<s> they say the lady is fair ’tis a truth i can bear them witness and virtuous ’tis so i cannot reprove it and wise but for loving me by my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of her folly for i will be horribly in love with her </s>
<s> i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter </s>

<s> when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married </s>
<s> she’s a fair lady i do spy some marks of love in her </s>
<s> against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner </s>
<s> fair beatrice i thank you for your pains </s>
<s> i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me if it had been painful i would not have come </s>
<s> you take pleasure then in the message </s>
<s> yea just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal </s>
<s> you have no stomach signior fare you well </s>
<s> ‘against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner ’ there’s a double meaning in that </s>
<s> ‘i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me ’ that’s as much as to say any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks </s>

<s> good margaret run thee to the parlour there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursala walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou overheard’st us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honey suckles ripen’d by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favourites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it </s>
<s> there will she hide her to listen our propose </s>
<s> this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone </s>
<s> i’ll make her come i warrant you presently </s>
<s> now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit </s>
<s> my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid’s crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay </s>
<s> now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference </s>
<s> the pleasant’st angling is to see the fish cut with her golden oars the silver stream and greedily devour the treacherous bait so angle we for beatrice who even now is couched in the woodbine coverture </s>
<s> fear you not my part of the dialogue </s>
<s> then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it </s>
<s> they advance to the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggards of the rock </s>
<s> but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely </s>
<s> so says the prince and my new trothed lord </s>
<s> and did they bid you tell her of it madam </s>
<s> they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they lov’d benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it </s>
<s> doth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon </s>
<s> i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never fram’d a woman’s heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak </s>
<s> she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self endear’d </s>
<s> sure i think so and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love lest she make sport at it </s>
<s> i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featur’d but she would spell him backward if fair fac’d she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antick made a foul blot if tall a lance ill headed if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none </s>
<s> so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth </s>
<s> sure sure such carping is not commendable </s>
<s> no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable </s>
<s> but who dare tell her so </s>
<s> if i should speak she would mock me into air o </s>
<s> she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit </s>
<s> therefore let benedick like cover’d fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling </s>
<s> yet tell her of it hear what she will say </s>
<s> no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion </s>
<s> and truly i’ll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with </s>
<s> one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking </s>
<s> do not do your cousin such a wrong </s>
<s> she cannot be so much without true judgment — having so swift and excellent a wit as she is priz’d to have —as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick </s>
<s> he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio </s>
<s> i pray you be not angry with me madam speaking my fancy signior benedick for shape for bearing argument and valour goes foremost in report through italy </s>
<s> indeed he hath an excellent good name </s>
<s> his excellence did earn it ere he had it </s>
<s> come go in i’ll show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me tomorrow </s>
<s> she’s lim’d i warrant you we have caught her madam </s>
<s> if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps </s>
<s> advancing what fire is in mine ears </s>
<s> stand i condemn’d for pride and scorn so much </s>
<s> no glory lives behind the back of such </s>
<s> and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou dost deserve and i believe it better than reportingly </s>

<s> nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it </s>
<s> i will only be bold with benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupid’s bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him </s>

<s> indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard </s>
<s> nay a’ rubs himself with civet can you smell him out by that </s>
<s> that’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love </s>
<s> the greatest note of it is his melancholy </s>
<s> and when was he wont to wash his face </s>
<s> for the which i hear what they say of him </s>
<s> nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops </s>

<s> well for your favour sir why give god thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity </s>
<s> you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lanthorn </s>
<s> this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the prince’s name </s>
<s> how if a’ will not stand </s>
<s> why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave </s>
<s> if he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the prince’s subjects </s>
<s> true and they are to meddle with none but the prince’s subjects </s>
<s> you shall also make no noise in the streets for for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured </s>
<s> we will rather sleep than talk we know what belongs to a watch </s>
<s> why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for i cannot see how sleeping should offend only have a care that your bills be not stolen </s>
<s> well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed </s>
<s> why then let them alone till they are sober if they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for </s>
<s> if you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you meddle or make with them why the more is for your honesty </s>
<s> if we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him </s>
<s> truly by your office you may but i think they that touch pitch will be defiled </s>
<s> the most peaceable way for you if you do take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your company </s>

<s> nay by’r lady that i think a’ cannot </s>
<s> five shillings to one on’t with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offence to stay a man against his will </s>

<s> so will it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparell’d in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she liv’d indeed then shall he mourn — if ever love had interest in his liver — and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true </s>
<s> let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood </s>

<s> a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush’d at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit everything to fall in love with what she fear’d to look on </s>

<s> so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow </s>

<s> alas thrice gentle cassio my advocation is not now in tune my lord is not my lord nor should i know him were he in favour as in humour alter’d </s>

<s> nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observancy as fits the bridal </s>
