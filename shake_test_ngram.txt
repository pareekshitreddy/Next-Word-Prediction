<s> you have prevail d my lord if i can do it by aught that i can speak in his dispraise she shall not long continue love to him </s>
<s> but say this weed her love from valentine it follows not that she will love sir thurio </s>
<s> therefore as you unwind her love from him lest it should ravel and be good to none you must provide to bottom it on me which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine </s>
<s> and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine s report you are already love s firm votary and cannot soon revolt and change your mind </s>

<s> as much as i can do i will effect </s>
