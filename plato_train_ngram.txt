<s> there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable </s>
<s> sidenote the ruined man who has no occupation once a spendthrift now a pauper still exists in the state </s>
<s> a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature </s>
<s> 552b yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state </s>
<s> the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty </s>
<s> but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship </s>

<s> and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers 552d of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed </s>
<s> sidenote where there are paupers there are thieves clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighbourhood there are hidden away thieves and cut purses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors </s>
<s> well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers </s>
<s> yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler </s>
<s> 552e and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force </s>
<s> certainly we may be so bold </s>
<s> the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education ill training and an evil constitution of the state </s>
<s> such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils </s>
<s> 553a then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed </s>
<s> let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state </s>
<s> does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise </s>
<s> sidenote the ruin of the timocratical man gives birth to the oligarchical </s>
<s> a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden 553b foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him </s>
<s> sidenote his son begins life a ruined man and takes to money making </s>
<s> and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and 553c passion headforemost from his bosom s throne humbled by poverty he takes to money making and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together </s>
<s> is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar </s>
<s> 553d and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it </s>
<s> of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one </s>
<s> 553e and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth </s>
<s> sidenote the oligarchical man and state resemble one another in their estimation of wealth in their toiling and saving ways in their want of cultivation </s>
<s> yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came </s>
<s> let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them </s>
<s> first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth </s>
<s> also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable </s>
<s> he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of 554b man whom the vulgar applaud </s>
<s> is he not a true image of the state which he represents </s>
<s> he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state </s>
<s> you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said </s>
<s> i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour 8 </s>
<s> footnote 8 reading greek kai e ti ma ma lista </s>

<s> do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries </s>
<s> sidenote the oligarchical man keeps up a fair outside but he has only an enforced virtue and will cheat when he can </s>
<s> you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan </s>
<s> it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad 554d passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions </s>
<s> yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own </s>
<s> 261 yes and they will be strong in him too </s>
<s> the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires 554e will be found to prevail over his inferior ones </s>
<s> for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him </s>
<s> sidenote his meanness in a contest he saves his money and loses the prize </s>
<s> 555a and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money </s>
<s> can we any longer doubt then that the miser and money maker 555b answers to the oligarchical state </s>
<s> sidenote democracy arises out of the extravagance and indebtedness of men of family and position next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgment </s>
<s> that he said is our method </s>
<s> well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise </s>
<s> is it not on this wise the good at which such a state aims is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable </s>
<s> 555c the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance </s>
<s> there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will 555d be disregarded </s>
<s> and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary </s>
<s> sidenote who remain in the city and form a dangerous class ready to head a revolution </s>
<s> and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are 555e eager for revolution </s>
<s> on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state </s>
<s> 556a yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain </s>
<s> sidenote two remedies 1 restrictions on the free use of property the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a man s use of his own property or by another remedy what other </s>
<s> sidenote 2 contracts to be made at a man s own risk </s>
<s> one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let 556b there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous money making and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state </s>
<s> yes they will be greatly lessened </s>
<s> at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness 556c both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain </s>
<s> they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue </s>
<s> sidenote the subjects discover the weakness of their rulers </s>
<s> such is the state of affairs which prevails among them </s>
<s> and when they meet in private will not people be 556e saying to one another our warriors are not good for much </s>
<s> yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking </s>
<s> sidenote a slight cause internal or external may produce revolution </s>
<s> and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise within in the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasion may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and 557a may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause </s>
<s> sidenote such is the origin and nature of democracy </s>
<s> and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot </s>
<s> yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw </s>
<s> and now what is their manner of life and what sort of 557b a government have they </s>
<s> for as the government is such will be the man </s>
<s> 264 sidenote democracy allows a man to do as he likes and therefore contains the greatest variety of characters and constitutions </s>
<s> in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes </s>
<s> and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases </s>
<s> 557c then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures </s>
<s> this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being like an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower 9 </s>
<s> and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states </s>

<s> 557d yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government </s>
<s> because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state </s>
<s> 557e he will be sure to have patterns enough </s>

<s> and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not 558a this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful </s>
<s> 265 and is not their humanity to the condemned 10 in some cases quite charming </s>
<s> have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares </s>
<s> footnote 10 or the philosophical temper of the condemned </s>
<s> yes he replied many and many a one </s>
<s> sidenote all principles of order and good taste are trampled under foot by democracy </s>
<s> yes she is of a noble spirit </s>
<s> these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike </s>
<s> consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being </s>
<s> is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical 558d father who has trained him in his own habits </s>
<s> sidenote which are the necessary and which the unnecessary pleasures </s>
<s> and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary </s>
<s> would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures </s>
<s> 266 sidenote necessary desires cannot be got rid of are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get 558e rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us </s>
<s> and they are rightly called so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it </s>
<s> 559a we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary </s>
<s> and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary </s>
<s> suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them </s>
<s> will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and 559b strength be of the necessary class </s>
<s> that is what i should suppose </s>
<s> the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life </s>
<s> sidenote but may be indulged to excess </s>
<s> but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health </s>
<s> sidenote illustration taken from eating and drinking </s>
<s> and the desire which goes beyond this of more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be 559c rightly called unnecessary </s>
<s> may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production </s>
<s> and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good </s>
<s> and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave 267 559d of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical </s>
<s> again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process </s>
<s> sidenote the young oligarch is led away by his wild associates </s>
<s> when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may 559e imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical </s>
<s> sidenote there are allies to either part of his nature </s>
<s> and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is akin and alike again helping that which is akin and alike </s>
<s> and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred 560a advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself </s>
<s> and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young man s soul and order is restored </s>
<s> yes he said that sometimes happens </s>
<s> and then again after the old desires have been driven out 560b fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous </s>
<s> yes he said that is apt to be the way </s>
<s> they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him </s>
<s> at length they seize upon the citadel of the young man s soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels </s>
<s> false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place </s>
<s> they are certain to do so </s>
<s> sidenote the progress of the oligarchic young man told in an allegory </s>
<s> and so the young man returns into the country of the lotus eaters and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the king s fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter nor if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them </s>
<s> 560d there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border </s>
<s> and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of 560e him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling 561a them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage </s>
<s> and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures </s>
<s> yes he said the change in him is visible enough </s>
<s> sidenote he becomes a rake but he also sometimes stops short in his career and gives way to pleasures good and bad indifferently </s>
<s> sidenote he rejects all advice neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some 561c pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another </s>
<s> yes he said that is the way with him </s>
<s> sidenote passing his life in the alternation from one extreme to another </s>
<s> his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on </s>
<s> 561e yes he replied he is all liberty and equality </s>
<s> sidenote he is not one but all mankind s epitome </s>
<s> yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled </s>
<s> and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him </s>
<s> 561a let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man </s>
<s> 270 let that be his place he said </s>
<s> last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider </s>
<s> say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise that it has a democratic origin is evident </s>
<s> and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the 562b same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort </s>
<s> sidenote the insatiable desire of wealth creates a demand for democracy the insatiable desire of freedom creates a demand for tyranny </s>
<s> the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right </s>
<s> and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money getting was also the ruin of oligarchy </s>
<s> and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution </s>
<s> freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy 562c is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell </s>
<s> yes the saying is in every body s mouth </s>
<s> i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny </s>
<s> when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil 562d cup bearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs </s>
<s> yes he replied a very common occurrence </s>
<s> sidenote freedom in the end means anarchy </s>
<s> yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are 271 like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public </s>
<s> now in 562e such a state can liberty have any limit </s>
<s> by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them </s>
<s> i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the 563a stranger is quite as good as either </s>
<s> yes he said that is the way </s>
<s> sidenote the inversion of all social relations </s>
<s> and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be 563b thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young </s>
<s> the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other </s>
<s> 563c why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips </s>
<s> 272 when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe </s>
<s> you and i have dreamed the same thing </s>
<s> and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have 563e no one over them </s>
<s> yes he said i know it too well </s>
<s> such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny </s>
<s> but what is the next step </s>
<s> the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive 564a increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government </s>
<s> the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery </s>
<s> and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty </s>
<s> sidenote the common evil of oligarchy and democracy is the class of idle spend thrifts </s>
<s> that however was not as i believe your question you rather desired to know what is that disorder which is 564b generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both </s>
<s> well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings </s>
<s> these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body </s>
<s> 564c and the good physician and lawgiver of the state 273 ought like the wise bee master to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible </s>
<s> yes by all means he said </s>
<s> sidenote altogether three classes in a democracy </s>
<s> then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into 564d three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state </s>
<s> and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified </s>
<s> sidenote 1 the drones or spend thrifts who are more numerous and active than in the oligarchy </s>
<s> because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do 564e not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones </s>
<s> then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass </s>
<s> sidenote 2 the orderly or wealthy class who are fed upon by the drones </s>
<s> they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders is sure to be the richest </s>
<s> they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones </s>
<s> why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little </s>
<s> and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them </s>
<s> 565a that is pretty much the case he said </s>
<s> sidenote 3 the working class who also get a share </s>
<s> the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon </s>
<s> this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy </s>
<s> true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey </s>
<s> 274 and do they not share </s>
<s> do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves </s>
<s> 565b why yes he said to that extent the people do share </s>
<s> sidenote the well to do have to defend themselves against the people </s>
<s> and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can </s>
<s> and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy </s>
<s> and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are 565c deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them </s>
<s> then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another </s>
<s> sidenote the people have a protector who when once he tastes blood is converted into a tyrant </s>
<s> the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness </s>
<s> 565d this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector </s>
<s> how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant </s>
<s> clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus </s>
<s> the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is 565e destined to become a wolf </s>
<s> and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them 275 making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what 566a will be his destiny </s>
<s> must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant </s>
<s> this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich </s>
<s> sidenote after a time he is driven out but comes back a full blown tyrant </s>
<s> after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown </s>
<s> 566b and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him </s>
<s> yes he said that is their usual way </s>
<s> then comes the famous request for a body guard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the people s friend as they say be lost to them </s>
<s> the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves </s>
<s> and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward 11 </s>
<s> and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again </s>
<s> but if he is caught he dies </s>
<s> sidenote the protector standing up in the chariot of state </s>
<s> 566d and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute </s>
<s> and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated </s>
<s> yes he said let us consider that </s>
<s> at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called 566e a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private </s>
<s> liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one </s>
<s> sidenote he stirs up wars and impoverishes his subjects by the imposition of taxes </s>
<s> but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader </s>
<s> 567a has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him </s>
<s> and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war </s>
<s> 567b now he begins to grow unpopular </s>
<s> then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done </s>

<s> that again he said is a very fair proposal </s>
<s> shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person </s>
<s> we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries </s>
<s> 577c let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions </s>
<s> sidenote the state is not free but enslaved </s>
<s> beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved </s>
<s> no city he said can be more completely enslaved </s>
<s> and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state </s>
<s> yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved </s>
<s> sidenote like a slave the tyrant is full of meanness and the ruling part of him is madness </s>
<s> 577d then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail </s>
<s> his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest </s>
<s> and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave </s>
<s> he has the soul of a slave in my opinion </s>
<s> 288 and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily </s>
<s> sidenote the city which is subject to him is goaded by a gadfly 577e and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse </s>
<s> and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor </s>
<s> sidenote poor 578a and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable </s>
<s> and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear </s>
<s> is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain </s>
<s> and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires </s>
<s> 578b reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states </s>
<s> and i was right he said </s>
<s> sidenote also the tyrannical man is most miserable </s>
<s> and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him </s>
<s> i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men </s>
<s> sidenote yet there is a still more miserable being the tyrannical man who is a public tyrant </s>
<s> there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong </s>
<s> i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery </s>
<s> one of whom i am about to speak </s>
<s> 578c he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant </s>
<s> from what has been said i gather that you are right </s>
<s> 289 yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest </s>
<s> let me then offer you an illustration which may i think 578d throw a light upon this subject </s>
<s> sidenote in cities there are many great slaveowners and they help to protect one another </s>
<s> the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the tyrant s condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves </s>
<s> you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants </s>
<s> but do you observe the reason of this </s>
<s> yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual </s>
<s> sidenote but suppose a slaveowner and his slaves carried off into the wilderness what will happen then </s>
<s> such is the condition of the tyrant </s>
<s> but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves </s>
<s> yes he said he will be in the utmost fear </s>
<s> 579a the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants </s>
<s> yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself </s>
<s> and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life </s>
<s> 579b his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies </s>
<s> sidenote he is the daintiest of all men and has to endure the hardships of a prison and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts </s>
<s> his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never 290 allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman 579c hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest </s>
<s> sidenote miserable in himself he is still more miserable if he be in a public station </s>
<s> and amid evils such as these will not he who is ill governed in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant </s>
<s> he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his 579d life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men </s>
<s> yes he said the similitude is most exact </s>
<s> sidenote he then leads a life worse than the worst is not his case utterly miserable </s>
<s> and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst </s>
<s> sidenote in unhappiness he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation 579e and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind </s>
<s> he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds </s>
<s> 580a moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself </s>
<s> no man of any sense will dispute your words </s>
<s> sidenote the umpire decides that come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical 580b contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second 291 and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical </s>
<s> the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery </s>

<s> this is the proclamation of the son of ariston </s>
<s> need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest 580c is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state </s>
<s> make the proclamation yourself he said </s>
<s> and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men </s>
<s> then this i said will be our first proof and there is 580d another which may also have some weight </s>
<s> sidenote proof derived from the three principles of the soul </s>
<s> the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration </s>
<s> it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers </s>
<s> there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third 580e having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it 581a also money loving because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money </s>
<s> sidenote 1 the appetitive if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be 292 able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money </s>
<s> again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame </s>
<s> sidenote 2 the ambitious suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable </s>
<s> sidenote 3 the principle of knowledge and truth </s>
<s> on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame </s>
<s> lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul </s>
<s> one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men 581c another in others as may happen </s>
<s> then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain </s>
<s> and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects </s>
<s> sidenote each will depreciate the others but only the philosopher has the power to judge now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others 581d the money maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver </s>
<s> and the lover of honour what will be his opinion </s>
<s> will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him </s>
<s> 293 sidenote because he alone has experience of the highest pleasures and is also acquainted with the lower </s>
<s> and are we to suppose 2 i said that the philosopher sets 581e any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure </s>
<s> does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them </s>
<s> footnote 2 reading with grasere and hermann greek ti oi ô metha and omitting greek ou de n which is not found in the best mss </s>
<s> there can be no doubt of that he replied </s>
<s> since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or 582a less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly </s>
<s> i cannot myself tell he said </s>
<s> well but what ought to be the criterion </s>
<s> is any better than experience and wisdom and reason </s>
<s> there cannot be a better he said </s>
<s> of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated </s>
<s> has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of 582b knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain </s>
<s> the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth </s>
<s> then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience </s>
<s> again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom </s>
<s> nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found 294 in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only </s>
<s> 582d his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one </s>
<s> sidenote the philosopher alone having both judgment and experience and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience </s>
<s> further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher </s>
<s> reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest </s>
<s> and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument </s>
<s> if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or 582e blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy </s>
<s> or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgment of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest </s>
<s> sidenote the pleasures which he approves are the true pleasures he places 1 the love of wisdom 2 the love of honour 3 and lowest the love of gain </s>
<s> but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest </s>
<s> and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the 583a intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life </s>
<s> unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life </s>
<s> and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next </s>
<s> clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the money maker </s>
<s> last comes the lover of gain </s>
<s> sidenote true pleasure is not relative but absolute </s>
<s> 583b twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls </s>
<s> yes the greatest but will you explain yourself </s>
<s> 583c i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions </s>
<s> say then is not pleasure opposed to pain </s>

<s> you remember what people say when they are sick </s>
<s> that after all nothing is pleasanter than health </s>
<s> but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until 583d they were ill </s>
<s> sidenote the states intermediate between pleasure and pain are termed pleasures or pains only in relation to their opposites </s>
<s> and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain </s>
<s> and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure </s>
<s> yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest </s>
<s> 583e again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful </s>
<s> then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain </s>
<s> 296 but can that which is neither become both </s>
<s> and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not </s>
<s> sidenote pleasure and pain are said to be states of rest but they are really motions </s>
<s> 584a but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them </s>
<s> how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain </s>
<s> this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is to say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition </s>
<s> sidenote all pleasures are not merely cessations of pains or pains of pleasures e g </s>
<s> the pleasures of smell are not </s>
<s> 584b look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure </s>
<s> what are they he said and where shall i find them </s>
<s> there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them </s>
<s> 584c let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure </s>
<s> still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain </s>
<s> and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature </s>
<s> 584d shall i give you an illustration of them </s>
<s> 297 you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region </s>
<s> sidenote illustrations of the unreality of certain pleasures </s>
<s> and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world </s>
<s> to be sure he said how can he think otherwise </s>
<s> 584e but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending </s>
<s> all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions </s>
<s> no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite </s>
<s> look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like 585b are inanitions of the bodily state </s>

<s> and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence </s>
<s> yes of knowledge in the same degree </s>
<s> and of truth in the same degree </s>
<s> and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence </s>
<s> 585d then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul </s>
<s> and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul </s>

<s> for they are mere shadows and pictures of 586c the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth </s>

<s> i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle </s>
<s> and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch </s>
<s> and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count 587d as one royal and aristocratical </s>
<s> then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three </s>
<s> sidenote expressed under the symbol of a cube corresponding to the number 729 </s>
<s> the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure </s>
<s> and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king </s>
<s> yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum </s>
<s> or if some person begins at the other end and measures 587e the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is completed living 729 times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval </s>
<s> and how enormous is the 588a distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain </s>

<s> footnote 3 729 nearly equals the number of days and nights in the year </s>
<s> yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them </s>
<s> then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue </s>
<s> 588b well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just </s>
<s> 302 now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him </s>
<s> what shall we say to him </s>
<s> let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes </s>

<s> there are said of have been such unions </s>

<s> next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees 588e only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature </s>
<s> i have done so he said </s>
<s> sidenote will any one say that we should strengthen the monster and the lion at the expense of the man </s>
<s> 303 certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says </s>

<s> yes he said but they would be appearances only </s>
<s> sidenote but this is an appearance only and the painter too is a maker of appearances </s>
<s> very good i said you are coming to the point now </s>
<s> and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not </s>
<s> but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue </s>
<s> and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed </s>
<s> yes he said but not a real bed </s>
<s> 597a and what of the maker of the bed </s>
<s> were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed </s>
<s> then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth </s>
<s> at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth </s>
<s> no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth </s>
<s> suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is </s>
<s> sidenote three beds and three makers of beds </s>
<s> well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker </s>
<s> there is another which is the work of the carpenter </s>
<s> and the work of the painter is a third </s>
<s> beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter </s>
<s> yes there are three of them </s>
<s> 310 597c god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god </s>
<s> god could only make one bed if he made two a third would still appear behind them </s>
<s> because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and not the two others </s>
<s> 597d god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only </s>
<s> shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed </s>
<s> yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things </s>
<s> and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed </s>
<s> but would you call the painter a creator and maker </s>
<s> yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed </s>
<s> sidenote 3 the imitator i e </s>
<s> the painter or poet 597e i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make </s>
<s> good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator </s>
<s> and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth </s>
<s> then about the imitator we are agreed </s>
<s> and what about 598a the painter </s>
<s> i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists </s>
<s> as they are or as they appear </s>
<s> you have still to determine this </s>
<s> sidenote whose art is one of imitation or appearance and a long way removed from the truth </s>
<s> i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality </s>
<s> and the same of all things </s>
<s> yes he said the difference is only apparent </s>
<s> 598b now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality </s>
<s> sidenote any one who does all things does only a very small part of them </s>
<s> then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image </s>
<s> for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he 598c knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter </s>
<s> sidenote any one who pretends to know all things is ignorant of the very nature of knowledge </s>
<s> and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy 598d than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought all knowing because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation </s>
<s> sidenote and he who attributes such universal knowledge to the poets is similarly deceived </s>
<s> and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all 598e things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion </s>
<s> perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that 599a these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth 312 because they are appearances only and not realities </s>
<s> or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well </s>
<s> the question he said should by all means be considered </s>
<s> sidenote he who could make the original would not make the image </s>
<s> now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the image making branch </s>
<s> would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had 599b nothing higher in him </s>
<s> the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them </s>
<s> yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit </s>
<s> friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help </s>

<s> i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator </s>

<s> or is there any invention 1 of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him </s>
<s> there is absolutely nothing of the kind </s>

<s> had he in his lifetime friends 600b who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him </s>
<s> nothing of the kind is recorded of him </s>
<s> for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was 600c greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive </s>

<s> yes i replied that is the tradition </s>

<s> and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous </s>
<s> would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay 314 600e at home with them </s>
<s> or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough </s>
<s> yes socrates that i think is quite true </s>

<s> they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them </s>
<s> sidenote they know nothing of true existence </s>
<s> here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only </s>
<s> then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation </s>
<s> of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit </s>
<s> 315 and the worker in leather and brass will make them </s>
<s> sidenote the maker has more knowledge than the imitator but less than the user </s>
<s> but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins </s>
<s> nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form </s>
<s> and may we not say the same of all things </s>
<s> 601d that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them </s>
<s> sidenote goodness of things relative to use hence the maker of them is instructed by the user </s>
<s> and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them </s>
<s> then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the flute player will tell the flute maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought 601e to make them and the other will attend to his instructions </s>
<s> the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him </s>
<s> sidenote the maker has belief and not knowledge the imitator neither </s>
<s> the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him 602a and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge </s>
<s> but will the imitator have either </s>
<s> will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful </s>
<s> or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw </s>
<s> then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations </s>
<s> the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations </s>
<s> 602b and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude </s>
<s> thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates </s>
<s> imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree </s>
<s> sidenote imitation has been proved to be thrice removed from the truth </s>
<s> 602c and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth </s>
<s> and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed </s>
<s> i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance </s>
<s> and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable </s>
<s> thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us 602d and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic </s>
<s> sidenote the art of measuring given to man that he may correct the variety of appearances </s>
<s> and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding there 317 is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight </s>
<s> 602e and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul </s>
<s> and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction </s>
<s> but were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing </s>
<s> 603a then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure </s>
<s> and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation </s>
<s> and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul </s>
<s> this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of 603b a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim </s>
<s> sidenote the productions of the imitative arts are bastard and illegitimate </s>
<s> the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring </s>
<s> and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry </s>
<s> probably the same would be true of poetry </s>
<s> do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see 318 603c whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad </s>
<s> we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly </s>
<s> sidenote they imitate opposites but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity 603d with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life </s>
<s> though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment </s>
<s> and we were right he said </s>
<s> yes i said thus far we were right but there was an 603e omission which must now be supplied </s>
<s> were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another </s>
<s> sidenote they encourage weakness but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow </s>
<s> the latter he said is the truer statement </s>
<s> 604a tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone </s>
<s> it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not </s>
<s> when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do </s>
<s> there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is 604b forcing him to indulge his sorrow </s>
<s> but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him </s>
<s> one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law </s>
<s> sidenote they are at variance with the exhortations of philosophy the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human 604c thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required </s>
<s> that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith 604d to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art </s>
<s> yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune </s>
<s> yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason </s>
<s> sidenote they recall trouble and sorrow and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly </s>
<s> 604e and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation </s>
<s> whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre </s>
<s> for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers </s>
<s> then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not 320 by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated </s>
<s> sidenote they minister in an inferior manner to an inferior principle in the soul </s>
<s> and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this 605b i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well ordered state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason </s>
<s> as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the 605c irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another small he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth 3 </s>

<s> hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in 605d which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most </s>
<s> but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part 605e and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman </s>
<s> 321 now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person </s>
<s> no he said that is certainly not reasonable </s>
<s> 606a nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view </s>
<s> sidenote we fail to observe that a sentimental pity soon creates a real weakness </s>
<s> few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves </s>
<s> and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own </s>
<s> sidenote in like manner the love of comedy may turn a man into a buffoon </s>
<s> and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous </s>
<s> 606d and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them 322 poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue </s>
<s> sidenote we are lovers of homer but we must expel him from our state </s>

<s> but that she may not impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in 607c the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them </s>

<s> and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved 607e we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight </s>

<s> at all events we are well aware 4 that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the 608b city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law </s>

<s> yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it </s>
<s> i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light </s>
<s> there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil </s>
<s> 608e would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good </s>
<s> sidenote everything has a good and an evil and if not destroyed by its own evil will not be destroyed by that of another </s>
<s> and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil 609a as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease </s>
<s> and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies </s>
<s> the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction 325 of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will 609b for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil </s>
<s> if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction </s>
<s> well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul </s>
<s> yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now 609c passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance </s>
<s> sidenote therefore if the soul cannot be destroyed by moral evil she certainly will not be destroyed by physical evil </s>
<s> but does any of these dissolve or destroy her and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul </s>
<s> take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation 609d through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them </s>
<s> consider the soul in like manner </s>
<s> does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her </s>
<s> do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body </s>
<s> and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own </s>
<s> 609e consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body 610a has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which 326 is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny </s>
<s> sidenote evil means the contagion of evil and the evil of the body does not infect the soul </s>
<s> and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another </s>
<s> yes he said there is reason in that </s>
<s> either then let us refute this conclusion or while it 610b remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed 610c by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man </s>
<s> and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death </s>
<s> nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil </s>
<s> but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth 610e and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her dwelling place from being a house of death </s>
<s> true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction </s>
<s> 327 yes that can hardly be </s>
<s> but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether 611a inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal </s>
<s> sidenote if the soul is indestructible the number of souls can never increase or diminish </s>
<s> that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number </s>
<s> neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality </s>
<s> 611b but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity </s>
<s> the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements </s>
<s> sidenote the soul if she is to be seen truly should be stripped of the accidents of earth </s>
<s> her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she 611c really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly </s>
<s> thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared 611d to that of the sea god glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form </s>
<s> and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills </s>

<s> 611e at her love of wisdom </s>
<s> of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough </s>
<s> sidenote having put aside for argument s sake the rewards of virtue we may now claim to have them restored </s>
<s> and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument 5 612b we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature </s>

<s> will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument </s>
<s> the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be 612d weighed against pure injustice </s>
<s> i should be much to blame if i had forgotten </s>
<s> then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and 329 men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us 6 since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own </s>

<s> 612e the demand he said is just </s>
<s> in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods </s>
<s> sidenote the just man is the friend of the gods and all things work together for his good </s>
<s> and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning </s>
<s> 613a and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins </s>
<s> then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as 613b man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue </s>

<s> let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair </s>
<s> and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he 619c was fated among other evils to devour his own children </s>
<s> but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself </s>

<s> 628 and he speculates on the possibility of redeeming trade from reproach by compelling some of the best citizens to open a shop or keep a tavern 11 </s>
<s> in these respects as well as in the introduction of common meals plato was probably influenced by the traditional ideal of sparta cp introd </s>

<s> 9 § 8 they did not hold office or learn the use of arms </s>

<s> but it is also possible that these accounts of the brotherhood of pythagoras some of which have reached us on very doubtful authority may be themselves to a considerable extent coloured and distorted by features adapted from the republic </s>
